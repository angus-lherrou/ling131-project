and now you're always America's favorite I doctor Dr would Congress [noise]\nWelcome to healthy vision this is your host Dr Edward ... and thank you so much for tune again to listening to this episode and today we're going to be talking about at Central minerals to save your site\nSo many people talk about vitamins diet and nutrition but I think minerals are really a neglected part of our overall health approach and I'm going to share with you some fascinating information that I think you'll find interesting\nThat there are certain mineral deficiency that are associated with\nMacular degeneration cataracts and glaucoma\nAnd there is a very simple ten second taste test that can quickly determine if you are deficient in these essential minerals\nSo before I Begin to actually talk about\nWhat minerals are essential and minerals are related to these particular eye diseases I like to begin by talking about a very interesting book I read called topsoil and civilization\nIn in this book the authors studied societies that lasted over five thousand years they were looking for society's\nOr that had that longevity and they linked the success of any society believe it or not to the top soil so the interesting findings that they discovered was that\nThere are three factors that determine longevity other society number one\nThere had to be a constant source of water on this makes sense you need a constant source of water to grow all the essential or plants are grains and food to survive the second item that they came across as there has to be yearly flooding\nOkay so why yearly flooding well when there's yearly flooding\nUm the soil or the water brings with it a lot of the central minerals and nutrients that may not be president so in other words when you have yearly flooding there is a constant uh replenishment of the soil of all all these the central minerals the third item that they discovered is\nIt has to be a flat area there be any hills or valleys so these are the three essential ingredients one a constant source of water a yearly flooding and the flat area\nSo you know the history of our civilization there have been three areas that have met the criteria this is the Nile River basin the Tigris and Euphrates River\nSecond item that they came across as there has to be yearly flooding okay so why yearly flooding well when there's only flooding\nUm the soil or the water brings with it a lot of the central minerals and nutrients that may not be president so in other words when you have yearly flooding there is a constant replenishment of the soil of all all these the central minerals the third item that they've discovered this\nHas to be a flat area the ... so these are the three essential ingredients one a constant source of water a yearly flooding and the flat area\nSo you know the history of our civilization there have been three areas that have met the criteria [noise]\nThis is the Nile River basin the Tigris and Euphrates River and the ... a Hindu river valley these free areas met these these criteria but once any one of these criteria was changed\nDot com or call one eight hundred for three zero nine three two week once again that WWW home restore vision dot com or one eight hundred for three year old nine three to wait [noise]\nTwo houses again we're talking about essential minerals for your eyes and yes there are some very essential minerals that you have to have\nTo be aware of if you have particular eye problems so let's just go through them it seems like with cataracts\nThere was a study done and out over this study a little bit later that showed that people with cataracts have low levels of magnesium and ... magnesium is a key essential mineral that most people are deficient in\nNext ways glaucoma glaucoma there seems to be a deficiency in Crimea and macular degeneration a deficiency in zinc Google Talk about studies and data that have supported\nThe particular central miserable for each one of these diseases now\nWe're talking about the taste tests the taste test his a\nSimple effective way insane very quickly if you're deficient in this particular mineral [noise] and um I really became interested in the taste test after studying with Dr Patricia Cain that brilliant nutritionist from New Jersey\nAnd she uses to taste test all the time not only to determine deficiencies\nMagnesium is a key essential mineral that most people are deficient in next\nWays glaucoma glaucoma there seems to be a deficiency in Crimea and macular degeneration a deficiency in zinc we'll talk about studies and data that have supported the particular central miserable for each one of these diseases now\nWe're talking about the taste tests to taste test his a\nSimple effective way insane very quickly if you're deficient in this particular mineral [noise] and um I really became interested in the taste test after studying with Dr Patricia Cain that brilliant nutritionist from New Jersey\nAnd she uses to taste test all the time not only to determine deficiencies or but she feels that this is a very very important in a way of determining which mineral replacements you need in order to balance your body and to get rid of heavy metals\nSo if you want more information on this go to WWW vision mineral test all one word vision mineral test dot com so we already covered some of the reasons why\nMineral deficiencies are becoming more common place and one of them is our soils are becoming deficient the second is that we are not having adequate nutrition\nWere eating genetically modified food food that's grown in barren soil that uses artificial fertilizers and pesticides so\nOne of the best things you can do is to shift your diet more towards organic raw natural food\nI Believe just like\nA Thomas Edison said that the doctor or the future would prescribe do medication but instead advice the patient on food and nutrition and that's what you need to do you need to shift your diet more towards organic Ron natural food and you will get these the central minerals\nNow another problem we have because as we get older are digestion and absorption changes so even though you may be eating\nGood food healthy foods or even taking vitamins nutritional supplements you still may be deficient I was shocked eighty percent of patients that I see with macular degeneration are deficient in sync\nEven though they're taking zinc as a supplement it later on we'll talk about the proper forms of these nutrients that you need to take the most common form of zinc is think oxide and unfortunately that's poorly absorbed you need to be taking a key elated form of like\nThe other shocking factor is if you are deficient in one or more minerals there is a good chance that you're deficient in a lot of other\nNutritional supplements nutritional key ingredients like vitamin C. E. A. and uh other factors which are central for good health so remember that\nIf you are deficient in one mineral and that's why it's important that you quickly find out if you are deficient\nYou need to Ben begin looking at taking a good nutritional supplement one of the things that I have realized that there are many good nutritional products on the market but what makes mind nutritional products unique is we have digestive enzymes we have pro by objects\nAnd a little supplemental hydro clerk acid in each product\nList helps eight in the digestion and absorption of these key nutritional products\nNo it isn't\nYou know supplements nutritional key ingredients like vitamin C. E. A. and uh other factors which are central for good health so remember that\nIf you are deficient in one mineral and that's why it's important that you quickly find out if you are deficient\nYou need to Ben begin looking at taking a good nutritional supplement one of the things that I have realized that there are many good nutritional products on the market but what makes mind nutritional products unique is we have digestive enzymes we have pro by objects\nAnd a little supplemental hydro clerk acid in each product\nMiss helps eight in the digestion and absorption of these key nutritional products\nNow it is important that your properly hydrated because drinking plenty of good water helps eliminate the toxins in your body which are interfering with the central minerals\nNow unfortunately most of us know that we should not be drinking tap water\nThat tap water has a harmful a products a fluoride or chlorine heavy metals and pharmaceuticals are now being finds out of water so you really need to look yeah drinking a good source of water and I like\nReverse osmosis water reverse osmosis water eliminates all those harmful products in the water\nAnd you have a good source of drinking water not putting additional toxins in your body remember if you're putting additional toxins your body especially lead and mercury they act like big bullies and they're going to be pushing out those essential minerals which are essential for good visual health\nNow the question and it's always ask Dr Conn Dr ... still to reverse osmosis water and it is it true that you have a lemonade it all the central minerals in the water yes that is correct but I feel that if\nYou do have a diet of good organic raw foods you'll be getting those essential minerals and also I recommend that\nYou use Himalayan sea salt Himalayan sea salt is manufactured\nAnd produce from an inland sea so it's not contaminated like our oceans so small pinch of Himalayan sea salt seems to do the trick small pinch of Emily and sea salt per quarter water and you will get those essential minerals\nSo let's talk about some of the key as central minerals that are really important to our body [noise]\nAh number one is magnesium\nMagnesium plays an important role in mitochondrial function and it is involved with many bio chemical reactions in the body\nEspecially the the neurological system and magnesium levels low like magnesium levels are linked with a very a variety of conditions including hypertension heart disease osteoporosis and poorly controlled diabetes\nSo a good indication that you may be deficient in magnesium is that you have ... the patient muscle cramps insomnia\nAnd a magnesium is related to calcium metabolism so sometimes if there's a imbalance with the magnesium\nYou're going to have access of levels of calcium\nAnd this study which will talk about later have has linked a low magnesium with cataracts phosphorus has another mineral that's important and it's a central component of south\nAnd magnesium levels low like magnesium levels are linked with a very a variety of conditions including hypertension heart disease osteoporosis and poorly controlled diabetes\nSo a good indication that you may be deficient in magnesium is that you have cost the patient muscle cramps insomnia\nAnd a magnesium is related to calcium metabolism so sometimes if there's a imbalance with the magnesium you're going to have access of levels of calcium\nAnd this study which will talk about later have as linked a low magnesium with cataracts phosphorus is another mineral that's important and it's essential component of cells\nAnd it's a plays a role with calcium a tab metabolism electrolytes imbalance\nAnd ah it's key component of ATP which is like the gasoline of the cells zinc is another essential mineral zinc is required for sexual maturation\nHelps regulate your appetite and stress level and controls taste and smell and it was a major study done um [noise] uh the a red study\nWhere they actually determine that zinc deficiency is linked with macular degeneration and in fact if you're low in zinc there's a twenty five in a fold increase in developing macular degeneration so zinc is the test that I recommend\nThat you take if you have macular degeneration we have to find out if you're deficient in sync calcium is another important mineral and it's crucial for maintaining proper nerve heart function and muscle contraction in addition to your bones\nAre iron is important because iron is crucial for many body functions you know iron is a key and green greedy and the ... which is the oxygen carrying\nComponent of red blood cells if you're deficient in our new probably to fish we developing anemia and you'll be having low oxygen concentration low levels the lecture will be delivered to yourselves and Napoli a problem\nOf potassium is another critical element helps maintain the correct balance of fluid into body\nIt helps with muscle contraction heart contraction it's a key electrolytes\nSelenium is a trace mineral\nThat has a potent antioxidants and it is also related to your thyroid it's a key role in thyroid function so unfortunately because our soils are depleted we're seeing more and more deficiencies selenium last fleet chromium\nBecause our soils are depleted we're seeing more and more deficiencies of selenium last week chromium\nA long term effect on reducing the incidents of macular degeneration and zinc deficiency was clearly shown to be related to the development of macular degeneration in fact by taking a good thing supplement that may present prevent\nReduce your incidents of developing macular degeneration by twenty five percent interestingly I find that the majority of patients that I see with macular degeneration\nAre deficient in zinc even those individuals that are taking zinc as a supplement which is kind of scary so that means the issue is\nThey may be taking the supplement either they're not taking enough they're taking the wrong form or it's not being digested and absorb\nThat's why I recommend take keel aged form of sing along with accumulated form of magnesium and I'm\nA crime you do not take the oxide form the oxide form is poorly absorbed in fact I'm In sync oxide I'm not I don't recommend zinc oxide magnesium oxide can cause problems with a diarrhea\nSo make sure you take the key laid a form of zinc\nOnce again if you want more information go to the vision mineral test dot com vision mineral test all ... all one word for more information and I would like to offer all of you that are listening\nA sample ten second test for either cataracts glaucoma or macular degeneration innocence uh twenty nine dollar in Ninety five cents value\nIt sure is absolutely free all you have to do is pay a nominal amount for shipping and handling\nAnd will rush that ten second test for you with instructions\nIf you do measure a major deficiency\nOkay let's talk about the the liquid mineral taste test first of all this test I should not be a substitute for good medical advice if you do test that you're deficient I feel that you should consult with your ophthalmologist or what your medical doctor to get a confirmation\nThis test is a I think it's a very effective way of measuring it's very quick\nAll ten second test for either cataracts glaucoma or macular degeneration innocence uh twenty nine dollar in Ninety five cents value\nIt's yours absolutely free all you have to do is pay a nominal amount for shipping and handling and will rush that ten second test for you with instructions\nIf you do measure a major deficiency [noise]\nOkay let's talk about the the liquid mineral taste test first of all this test I should not be a substitute for good medical advice if you do test that you're deficient I feel that you should consult with your ophthalmologist or what your medical doctor to get a confirmation\nThis test is a I think it's a very effective way of measuring it's very quick and I think it's very accurate and it also can determine if you have a normal level\nSo if you are deficient than you may want to re test yourself in a couple of months not sooner because if you artificial takes a long time [noise]\nSo when you receive the taste test it'll be in a single a syringe that you will either put all of it or half of it under your tongue or on top of the time whatever just give it in your mouth and kind of switch it around [noise]\nAnd then you want to comment on the taste\nIf it tastes sweet or pleasant ah that probably means that you are extremely deficient\nIf you take something and you don't like it or it's pretty bad that means you have adequate level so it's actually a very simple test\nUm square to drop her full in your mouth swished liquid around and then make a note of your immediate taste and what happens after ten seconds so remember\nIf it's good ... that's bad that means you're deficient\nIf it takes bad that's good that means you have adequate levels\nSo I can remember doing the zinc test uh years ago and I could barely taste anything and maybe it was a little sweet but I was quite surprised because I'm taking a multivitamin\nSo I began taking hundred milligrams of zinc ah the Colin eight every day and after a month I repeated the taste test\nOr when I in ... uh when I place that in my life it was oh it was awful and I thought the uh the solution to become Iran said and I held it up against the light and by golly was crystal clear and I said boy this test is really effective and later on\nMy zinc levels were confirmed to be normal by the only goes scan and blood test\nSo this is a really effective way of measuring a three important minerals in your body so once again\nFor cataracts magnesium for glaucoma it is currently him and for macular degeneration and sink if you are deficient\nIn these minerals there is a good chance that you are deficient in other minerals and other essential nutrients so I Would recommend that not only do you begin taking that particular mineral supplement\nSophie are deficient in Crimea begin taking chromium a two hundred micrograms a day that's micrograms that's just a small amount if you're deficient and zinc I Would recommend taking a hundred milligrams of St ... today and if you're deficient in a magazine\nThe way of measuring a three important minerals in your body so once again for cataracts magnesium for glaucoma it is currently him and for macular degeneration in sync if you are deficient\nIn these minerals used a good chance that you are deficient in other minerals and other essential nutrients so I Would recommend that not only do you begin taking that particular mineral supplement\nSocial are deficient including me and begin taking chromium a two hundred micrograms a day that's micrograms that's just a small amount if you're deficient zinc\nI Would recommend taking a hundred milligrams a saint ... today and if you're deficient in a magnesium I Would probably recommend three hundred four hundred milligrams of magnesium the day\nIn addition to looking at the other vitamins that I'd recommend for each of those specific conditions were coming up to a break\nAnd when we come back we'll finish finished discussing these central minerals that you need to know for your eye out we'll be right back after this break [noise]\n[noise]\nDoctors talk about vitamins diet and nutrition supplement [noise] minerals are neglected part of our overall health approach their key mineral deficiency is associated with muscular degeneration cataracts\nAnd glaucoma there's a very simple ten seconds these tests that can quickly determine if you're deficient in central minerals that is correct unit

find a solution and I knew nothing about solar I didn't know how it worked I didn't know how much it costs and I wrote my sleeves up and I looked into it and it made sense produce sure on power and pay less for it and so\nPeople out there talking about batteries and if somebody's trying to sell your battery talk to me before you do because people don't understand better either not rate what they

the morning of joy of which are\nDavid speak yes it's the same period of time and the divine plan\nThe divine plan of salvation as simple and beautiful Paul wrote that in Adam all die and then added even so in Christ should all be made it alive had it not been for the redemptive worker Christ Adam and his race would have gone into debt forever\nIn that case the dead could not be referred to as

profits\nI see is that why Jesus said to Martha I Am the resurrection and the life\nJust it was in one of the purposes of all Jesus miracles was to help us understand the realities of kingdom

regulatory matter would you mind telling my audience what dark regulatory matter eons Mm\n[noise] yeah well you know dark matter is often referred to as\nA the set of tools that the so called deep state court dark states used to carry out their own agenda is sometimes independent or the intention of Congress or the administration that they're supposed to be working for and I'm\nIn the context of a regulatory agencies there are several kinds of of dark matter of the ways that they can get around the specified procedures for carrying out their work so\nI'm One example is\nUm regulatory discretion and and that means that um they have discretion within what the law dictates that regulated industry or individuals must do and the the most egregious example of that with which\nYour listeners will be familiar\nWas a then the FBI Director Comey's decision an announcement that\nI'm Hillary Clinton's transgressions\nWith respect to a ... ... email a private in her private email server and so on did not meet the criteria for prosecution in his opinion so that was discretion about whether there should be enforcement of the rules about the\nClassify handling classified information um but they're they're all sorts of examples of ... in the in the regulatory community so I'm\nA ... for example a marijuana possession is still a federal crime and yet not prosecuted at all in the amounts per individual used in states like Colorado and California so there is a good example of federal enforcement discretion veterans\n... ... ... but at least they're they have I think it's called the Golan agreement that was actually drawn up by Obama that effectively said\nAll right to the U.S department of justice will ignore this violation of federal law by these stage even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to make it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use but at least\nExamples of ... in the in the regulatory community so I'm\nA ... for example a marijuana possession is still a federal crime and yet it's not prosecuted at all in a amounts per individual use in states like Colorado and California so there is a good example of federal enforcement discretion better runs well\n... ... ... but at least they're they have I think it's called the Golan agreement there was actually drawn up by Obama that effectively said\nAll right the U.S department of justice will ignore this violation of federal law by these states even though the drug is illegal federally will agree to not enforce it because the people in your state of agreed to\nMake it legal for either ... medical or a or a a recreational use but at least that was committed to a piece of paper so you could point to it and said that's what the agreement says it also says the agreement is null and void at the state allows a large amounts of contraband\nHot to be shipped out of state and do other states that have not agreed to legalize it\nSo at least those states get some protection but just some of this new regulatory dark matter also happened where discretion is used and there's no way to actually say well what is this additional discretion uh well it's it's as much as we decided to give whenever we decided to get it\nYeah well yeah and that's and that's the problem a said that I'm a FDA for example or does this all the time and had a good example is\nAnother kind of regulatory dark matter\nIf it is a back up a little bit of a second kind of regulatory dark matter is the issuance of guidance documents or memoranda or announcements instead of formal rulemaking formal role making specifies that there has to be an announcement of the federal register\nPublic comment consideration of public comment\nAnd then finally station of the of the rule but the agencies often get around that by issuing\nGuidance documents and then uh within the uh the guidance that they specify which is often\nNew policy making new law making that really wasn't contemplated by Congress they can specify carve outs for enforcement discretion within that\nAnd that's a sometimes at a bridge too far too much for autonomy that\nWas never contemplated for a\nFor regulatory agencies and yet they do this they do this all the time some guidance I guess good so that for example if the uh the food drug costs medical a law that says a there has to be a pre approval\nInspections of drug manufacturer pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities but\nUh but guidance documents can tell the industry\nWhat the

that as we've discussed another context is for Congress to exercise and performance oversight responsibilities are much better much more strictly much more conscientiously than they do\nAnd uh and and this was called Google ... and I actually talked about the fact that they have access to of course all of our personal information and there's thousands of people that do go and thousands of people who work at Google's business partners we have\nA have free access to our profiles our emails I mean how can they resist\nSnooping they can't and now in in a legal employees have been caught doing very bad things with our data and of course we also now have a leak showing an internal discussion among Google employees about how they can fight Donald Trump's a you know immigration policy\nOr this isn't just from two thousand Seventeen so you know there there are people they're just people frankly and I think most dangerous\nYeah I I guess Dr I Know they're just people but for example and I I really resist the idea that these should be turned into government government controlled utilities like\nA power company or a natural gas company I don't like that idea because I didn't get very

comparison isn't isn't appropriate I have\nFriends who are cops I don't even call them and say would you give me the criminal background on someone if it isn't public record already because I'm aware that the data systems they have access to I Would do that one is called the law enforcement data system you can plop and Dr Robert Epstein and\nFind out how many wants and warrants arrests and all kinds of other really salacious information might be available but Epstein her Larson or anyone else and I'm aware that there are there legal constraints on that I almost think there ought to be ethical concerns that are good cop\nShould say that data is for law enforcement only it is not for you know to be used by you to figure out whether your girlfriend has you know an arrest from ten years ago or potential employee does unless it is public information and all those people who work in police agencies sometimes they break the rules to\nBut they're tough consequences when they do you say you're not supposed to be using the lead system for anything but law enforcement is there for a reason to catch bad guys and bad gals but it's not there for you to check on your boyfriend\nOr your girlfriend you know if we catch doing it it's the end of your career is is Google prepared to beat that tough on employees who will break those rules\nAre well see there there's a big difference because you're talking about not just ethics you're talking about uh laws and regulations you're talking about accountability to the public and the problem is a with Google Facebook to there are no laws there are no regulations and there's no accountability to the public there's accountability its share of shareholders\nWell or my you know my my views on this actually have changed I have to say

trying to improve their life and their health welcome to the show Makita\nHello welcome thank you for having me yeah\nSo we have a lot of fun stuff to talk about this morning I Know we're definitely going to dig into the Quito drive as well but for any of you guys who have not heard me before I thought I'd give just a little introduction of who I Am and you know what I've done in the past so as a series that here I Do work for the company and you ... at the moment but I think\nThe health industry for about six seven years\nIt'll have strip on the way that you can do what I always make this one joke it's easy as one to peace because all you have to do is you either take the strip and then you can submerged insurance if you're if you're in the restroom or if you were to be in like a little ...\nYou could just put the ... you put it in for about one or two seconds and then you take it out and you can see that stripped change color and if you're like OK well what are these colors mean on the box itself as well there is a little tired and they can show you like where am I as far as he chose this goes on my and my completely off you know in the cool thing about this is when you're on a diet\nYou really need help kind of gauging like okay you know if you feel good but they're kinda understand better I'm at ... am I completely offer you could even tried after every food you eat you know and you can see sort of how your body is affecting not tight and that's great you know it's great to be able like okay if I eat this\nI Know this is helping me if I eat this is not so much and so the protest trip there's about a hundred and twenty five in the box so you've got a ton to play with their but that can help you gauge how much you are in key cos it's about the ph it's a little bit\nHarder for me to completely comment on that one but again we do have ph trips as well that can maybe help you teach that as well\nYeah when I think that sometimes it can be a misnomer that you know I've had some people coming in and say well I've been trying to keep a unified out but they're the loading up on bacon and some of the other side would not be enough to really what it is right and so we're talking about the healthy fats and the good you know protein put that also includes a lot of\nVegetables you know knocked the carb loading one you know right but the greens and stuff and those are what help your body stay with the good ph as well so when you are doing a full balance good heat to diet then that would help you know your ph I think as well from what I Know um and what I've been learning about it as well right\nTotally I mean and that's the thing with any direct you could take it one way or another it's like even thing I can but then you're eating a bunch of Eagan sheet of us you know I mean it's yeah right yeah it's definitely fun way to do it as well but you might feel so good after a while and and that is I'm Glad you mentioned that because that is the book it's healthy fats I think about the salmon ...\nYou know the own and things like that you definitely want to get your greens and ... even though you're low carb you know you can have a whole bowl of pasta and I'm barely had any carbohydrate containing ... that's my brain thinking about carbs right there\nAnd take that back I Know pasta I'm joking horrible salad fuse me like lettuce right and and you could not is barely any carbohydrates so you definitely want to get a lot of those and and if you look on line two it will help guide you and to what kind of vegetables are going to be more Quito friendly so to speak\nBut doing these altogether I'm you know it's important to have the diet right it definitely helps when you have the different supplements like I said the Quito drive which the beach and you don't necessarily have to take that every day I mean it definitely helps you if you want to um even if you think you're going to fall\nOff the holidays are coming you know how that is we always fall off and then we we want to get back on let's say throughout the week so it's nice to have even look a little I'm just a box at home to be able to help get yourself back on if you do end up falling off the holidays\nWe also wanted to get and what did you get on some of the products that we have this type of dieting and ah you know kind of talk show or for a little bit here because we're a great job of talking about the guys let's talk about great products that we have available record hoping habit\nAbsolutely yeah so just to recap a little bit on that because we talked about the diet but the key don't drive right and then she weighs about three different flavors this is definitely good for you if you're starting off if you're on the diet or even if you're worried about me falling off the holidays so that would be a great he used to have to he does have strips right it's definitely the second one that I Would encourage because it's just kind of hope you gauge where where\nAre you even in the diet in general um but that's a brands out actually has so many products I mean we have products that are even past the ... I it seems that of course could compliment but even separate I mean that was known to have a lot of really good blends right and I mentioned a couple off the bat we have one called the narrow peak right and right\nOn some of the products that we had earlier this type of dieting and ah you know kind of talk show or for a little bit here because we're a great job of talking about the guys who talked about great products that we have available right here helping\nHabit absolutely yeah so just to recap a little bit on that because we talked about the diet but the key don't drive right and then should we thought three different flavors this is definitely good for you if you're starting off if you're on the diet or even if you're worried about me falling off the holidays so that would be a great he used to have to test strips right it's definitely the second one that I Would encourage because it's just kind of help you gauge where where\nAre you even in the diet in general um but that's a brands out actually has so many products I mean we have products that are even past the key does I it seems that of course could compliment but even separate I mean that was known to have a lot of really good blends right and I mentioned a couple off of that we have one called the narrow peak\nRight and you write in kind of has this is going to be for your brain and all sorts of ways so the neural Pete is really good for memory and focus\nAnd clarity write something that I think all of us again could really use especially as the holidays you come our brains are everywhere I'm watching the key and my car because I'm like forgetting where I'm going what am I doing I mentioned a couple of ingredients that we do have in the narrow peak as well\nUm there's like for example dingo right we've always heard of ... can definitely help with memory in the brain but then you have things like rodeo law and I think I might have mentioned this last time I was on the radio because I always come up with this little silly way for me to remember rodeo law because rodeo isn't adapted Jenny curb\nRight in adoptions we think about helping hoping with stress and dealing with stress and so I always say if I was at a rodeo and I was sitting on a boy so stressed out being around so that I remembered rodeo and I think okay if I take\nRodeo law because I'd be at a rodeo this will help reduce my dress help calm me down right and if our stress levels are high our memory is not going to be there\nOur focus is going to be completely off so we can reduce the stress we have a better way grab our surroundings understand what's going on so\nAgain there are many ingredients in this product and again how do you blend is really nice because it's not always wanting readings that's she's going to help\nThe issue you're having having all these little guys in this one isn't it kind of have a backup plan so okay maybe the beach wealth helps me be the ... maybe the rodeo and again really nice planned on the narrow peak\nI Love this when I'm In school as well glad she take this one currently just kind of keep me focus school as well as work and everything else will a good thing like you said about plug in things that a lot of these will work synergistic leads to gather and rate of ...\nThey they they're rape and when you put them together it's it's really traits that extra boost that we need and whatever it is like you know the calmness we need\nCompletely able to yeah they kind of feed off each other right you just like you said they're synergistic they worked together and let's see one doesn't even ask the other one comes in and kind of helps out right so it's nice to have a ... because it's so hard for us to be like yeah we know when you think though er PS are all these other ingredients it's nice to have the blank to lean on it say okay I Know something in this will definitely help right if\nNot hold right of course all of them as the intent um\nAnd they all help differently once you help more with any of the focus for the other one helps a little bit with the energy you know and it'll and helps the memory so\nThey do work together to sort of give that full package of what we need ... and talking about stress I Know we mentioned a couple of times yes the holidays are coming up with my favorite time of year\nBut I also find myself getting so stressed because sometimes you have holiday parties and then you have family in town and get togethers and they try to get gifts for people and\nSo I Know that I personally need extra help ... you know around the holidays and so that is a really good product and then do you guys have another one I think it's called home now right yes I feel a little bit about that product and how that can help us\nAs well absolutely so again a calm now is another one of our blended formulas and our blends have had a lot of rape that a lot of them have in our best seller\nRight if not hold right of course all of them as the intent um and they will help differently one can help more with giving you the focus with the other one helps a little bit with the energy you know and it helps the memory so\nThey do work together to sort of give that full package of what we need ... and talking about stress I Know we mentioned a couple of times yes the holidays are coming up with my favorite time of year\nBut I also find myself getting so stressed 'cause sometimes you have holiday parties and then you have family in town and get togethers and they're trying to get gifts for people and\nSo I Know that I personally need extra help ... you know around the holidays and so that is a really good product and then do you guys have another one I think it's called home now right yes I can tell us a little bit about that product and how that can help us\nAs well absolutely so again a calm now is another one of our blended formulas and our blends have had a lot of rape that a lot of them have in our best sellers as well we've had a lot of good feedback on these plans\nBut the calm now again it is essentially a soothing stress formula right and helping you deal with stress and it can be similar to the narrow piece of the narrow peak it's going to be more intended for memory clarion focus as well so but in a way if you think about it again if we can reduce our stress that can sort of help\nWhat we're talking about which is we can't remember anything we can't think we're just so overwhelmed by life in general and so with the calm now there's so many great ingredients in here I wouldn't even have time to cover them all but again you do have rodeo low okay it's kind of mentioned the other one which we think of ... and adapt to Jenike herb\nOkay we have the Copa ... which is another doctor Jay curb another one for you guys to think of here when I think ... Copa I think of just the word cope\nAnd I go I Need help coping I'm just got so much stress right now you know I'm overwhelmed the anxiety everything's ... helps again alleviate the stress relax the body you know keep you more centered\nAnd then of course you have a lot of great things like magnesium right we know magnesium is so important for stress our body lived on nine easy and we needed to break down our stress\nAnd then if we run out of that were just more stress it's like this double edged sword right oh so you have to keep my and going and you got an average about eighty percent of people\nAre deficient in magnesium ... any we use it in over three hundred different properties in our body is so important absolutely magnesium and is a key element for our life in general so again you've got the things like ... as well I think it's great for a multitude of things I even think of think in the wintertime hoping is ill with our immune system and think about if we're\nIf we're overly stress more immune system is going to go low so it's really important to sort of balance it again and we need to balance immune system right relax the body as I Need to and how the different ... for a lot of great things in here again\nThat your body can lean on to sort of you know kinda rounded out together and make sure you have what you need yes well that's awesome and we are just about out of time so I Know we talked about this the Quito products you have recap really quickly and thirty seconds can you which ones they mentioned and things like that yes\nIt's a real quick high fat right low carbohydrate diet we've kind of things to support you guys here with this died in general but we do have lights out the Quito drive right we have these al ... has trips to help you kind of understand where you're at\nUm we even have a ton of other things like college in an emcee powder empty see we don't have time but that turned into key towns in the body so trying to great things here we mentioned the calm now\nBut we do have to drive right we have to help you kind of where you're at\nUm we haven't been hiring and I don't hear we mentioned now we\nWell you know I think um there are many India logical factors for developing type two diabetes for example which is about Ninety Ninety five percent of people with diabetes appetite to certainly um you know having abdominal\nWeight which may be related to\nUm overeating or choosing the wrong foods to eat not exercising but also environmental toxins are highly associated with insulin resistance which is what is\nThe main disease and people would pay to diabetes\nAs well as nutrient deficiency poor sleep or sleep apnea changes in the gut microbiomes stress management or as I said like you know and and and and nutritional deficiency so when we're looking at people with diabetes\nWe really have to look at it in a very comprehensive way to pick up at any particular imbalances that person may have said needs to be addressed to get their diabetes\nNot only under the best control it can be what's where people would take to maybe of course even reverse thing it or at least putting them into the mission\nYes and that's one thing that I Love you know looking at you know functional medicine and integrative medicine because you know we often conventional medicine often doesn't look at all of these underlying factors right to commute the root cause I mean that's a lot of different\nIssues that you just named that could be causing people to have diabetes right [noise]\nYeah and you know in my book we it discusses all of them in in the nonprofit these are all scientifically verified associations that can either helped causes diabetes or\nPrevent good control of diabetes\nOkay then um if you have a if you have\nYourself type two diabetes and waves diet no exercise stress you know the food chain maybe some other things going on in your body [noise] ah so if you're talking to\nA you know we have those people come in our store on a daily basis writers healthy habits and they want us to help them [noise] so what type of supplementation from a store like ours healthy habits\nDiabetes right [noise] yeah\nAnd you know in my book we it discusses all of them in in the nonprofit these are all scientifically verified associations that can either help causes diabetes or prevent good control of diet would be\nOkay and then um if you have a if you have\nGiven yourself type two diabetes and in a way it's diet no exercise stress you know bad food chain maybe some other things going on in your body so if you're talking to\nA you know we have those people come in our store on a daily basis writers healthy habits and they want us to help them [noise] so what type of supplementation from a store like ours healthy habit maybe that person [noise]\nWell I don't know if you carry my proprietary formula called dying men\nUh by a a supplement company\nBut if you don't set you may not you know you may not that's fine but then top supplements that a person with diabetes need to look at is a very good multiple vitamin mineral and generally not a one day\nThe one that has more to get more amount of capital to cover all of the vitamins and minerals particularly well not particularly but with a little edition of chromium zinc into the medium which help reduce insulin resistance fish oils\nHelp reduce insulin resistance they're anti inflammatory and there's a lot of association of inflammation causing\nInsulin resistance and then we're looking at other supplements such as also late poet gas it bends vote tea and mean is a fat soluble assignments or that's been shown to help prevent complications\nA Kirk human Berber rain a green tea acts that you know build Barry ... specifically protect the eyes\nOf some people you know send them and\nSo these are the behind the end of the Sistine is actually\nUm underutilized and according to hide them indeed if they have some vitamin D deficiency and also there are certain probiotics in the science that have been shown to help\nReduce a weight especially around the hips and and people that have metabolic syndrome which is oftentimes associated with people with diabetes type two diabetes so that's us\nYou know uh choosing from that menu you'll put us together as a good protocol\nYes you know we have many

such a small intestine bacterial older girls IDS gr\nI taught Castro for eleven years at the nature path to medical school in Tempe and have always included the gas ... intestinal problems are in my practice from from the get go\nNice and Jamie we'll recall we\nDetermine that we had someone call in and I know this is the question that I've often heard because you know we used to do sometimes see these things run in families so she was asking you know how does genetics come into play you know there's someone that the the father has diabetes and now they have diabetes so where does that come into play with all of this as well\nWell with like many things in families you know whether it's brown hair or height\nYou know diseases we now know genetic components and what passes down is not in general except for some ... ... ... you get a gene the question is is that gene going to turn off\nAnd so if you have a gene you have of capacity to develop\nThat condition and the question is are you going to and if so when so type two diabetes and actually type one\nIf a parent habits or grandparents had that you ... the the people vertical even eat them you know kid grandkid do have an increased risk of developing that diabetes now\nType one is a little different so let's focus on tape to play too if\nYou if you have that um if you have that capacity then I'm a if you're doing things that are out of balance like I have a a relative whose father\nDied of type two diabetes and when she was pregnant she gain too much weight and became a ... diabetic\nWhich is a person who's with us diabetes when they're pregnant and she had seen her dad and made every change necessary with diet and exercise and stress management then you know Thirty years later she's never developed type two diabetes because she saw the genetic risk with her\nI have an increased risk of developing that diabetes now type one is a little different so let's focus on tape to play too with\nYou if you have that um if you have that capacity then I'm\nA if you're doing things that are out of balance like I have a a relative whose father\nActually died of type two diabetes and when she was pregnant she gain too much weight and became a ... diabetic\nWhich is a person who's with us diabetes when they're pregnant and she had seen her dad and made every change necessary with diet and exercise and stress management then you know\nThirty years later she's never developed type two diabetes because she saw the genetic risk with her pregnancy\nAnd then made changes and stuck to them so that now that she's older she's healthy and anybody can do this right or this isn't you know this is what we can we can work against our genetic risk factors\nUm by making changes that we need a in our home in our diet and lifestyle\nYou know when I was right and speaking of diet we just had another caller and wondered about you know the certain diets that would be best she she had heard that you know eating a lot of vegetables which you really need to do so what is your take on a diet so [laughter]\nWell I think you know there was a really great article rich written by Dr Richard Feinstein and Richard Bernstein on you know that ... the low carb diet\nIs you know scientifically the key entrance treatment for people with diabetes now I don't believe personally that everybody in their uncle has to eat the low carb diet but if you have developed diabetes\nThat you that means if we say a one line definition the definition of diabetes is you've lost the metabolic capacity the processed\nCarbohydrates so this is the diet that we need to do to get it best under control low carb can come out meant in four main ways\nHealthy house called Arizona's most popular live on us to talk radio show was brought to you

thinking so much about money you don't want to see in math [laughter] so he gave me some things are eight okay here's one for today why do you confuse yourself with worry\nLeave the care of your affairs to me coming back got Jesus and everything will be peaceful\nI say to you in truth that every active true blind complete surrendered to me produces the fact that you desire and resolve all difficult situation and then you'd say oh Jesus I Surrender myself do you take care of everything a man thank you\nHello and thank you baby Jesus anyway [laughter]\nAll right I Love Jesus I Do I Love them a lot and I have to because I'm a big center big big center and a liar\nStop ... stop thinking so much about money he says I Want to see in math [laughter] so he gave me some things to rain okay here's one for today why do you confuse yourself with worry\nLeave the care of your affairs to me talking about got Jesus and everything will be peaceful\nI say to you in truth that every active crew blind complete surrendered to me produces the effect that you desire and resolve all difficult situation and then you say oh Jesus I Surrender myself do you take care of everything a man thank you\nHello and thank you baby Jesus anyway [laughter]\nAll right I Love Jesus I Do I Love them a lot and I have to because I'm a big center\nBig big center and a liar Laurie helped me down the road you know she helped me because we were we were you taught for me in one of our classes that we're doing\nNow after the classes that God just put it on my heart goes tell these people that are teaching with you the truth about this one subject and I did you know what it set me free oh boy I Love that anyway so George Gilbert\nWho was the one of those that used to be a CEO of Google was with mark Colombia and the great one and he's called he didn't call himself that other people calling the great one and ah he was giving a talk yesterday and interview and it just opened my eyes to a lot of things he was talking about the crypto cause him and\nThe evolution of the Internet and the way we pay and the center and it was really exciting stuff I I highly recommend that you go look it up but he was talking about how the Internet needs a new architecture\nSo today those of you are out there on the Internet by the way we are are going to get to the trade you're not going to what I mean is that\nThe ... the Internet needs a new architecture it needs to be done in certain ways because you see all these applications all the different sites would go to you need what\nAre you need passwords you need it and cumbersome you need to put in New phrases all the time you're always looking for trying to secure things after the fat so you get on the side and then you try to secure it\nMay here's the difference of what's happening with the ... chain\nVersus what's happening with the way the Internet is that the Internet was never set up for all of his trading money in the security or that you need to that it was never set up for that is that for email it was mainly for an inner uh\nCompanies to exchange ... inside each other and agencies and things like that personal stuff it was never made for what it is today that's why it's backwards like pushing a cart as like a pushing a cart with a noodle it's backwards and never works and it never does ever\nBut hey it's what we have and so the block chain is going to change a lot of things it's already here it's been around for decades almost fifty years with companies\nBut the block chain ... isn't immutable database\nDistributed across nodes hackers can only get what's in one computer so somebody hacks they can only half the computer they can't hack the other computers because what a block is made on the block chain it goes out to the different knows it's distributed all out to the world\nSo they would have to a hacker would have to be able to hack fifty one percent of all the computers which are millions at this point millions millions and millions of miles impossible to do\nAnd I want to see it it's not going to get done and tell you that so the black chain\nGoing to change a lot of things it's already here has been around for decades almost fifty years with companies but the block chain ... isn't immutable database\nDistributed across nodes hackers can only get what's in one computer so somebody hacks they can only ... computer they can't hack the other computers because what a block is made on the block chain it goes out to the different nose is distributed all out to the world\nSo they would have to a hacker would have to be able to hack fifty one percent of all the computers which are millions at this point millions millions and millions of miles impossible to do\nAnd I want to see it it's not going to get done and tell you that so the black chain is the heart\nRate is one of the most exciting things that's going on in the inner Internet in our current financial system\nEr and ... it's coming to our aunt auntie now the financial system as we know is coming to an end there's\nOur economy here in the United states is about twenty million a year\nWorldwide about two hundred and fifty to two hundred and eighty maybe three hundred trillion dollars there's another exact amount of that in debt\nThe Federal Reserve and the central bank issue fourteen trillion the day that goes out to the banking system starts out of New York gets distributed out through the world banking system every day five thousand one hundred and ten trillion dollars do you have about two hundred and fifty million dollars in debt about\nFive hundred trillion excuse me five thousand trillion gets diluted from their throughout the banking system it's a system that's on sustainable\nThere's coming a new monetary system\nIt's private it's public it's a big ... I Can't even say that word stick with his stick with us we'll get to that later\nIt will be measuring stick of how things are actually measured so you can't measure a dollar matter of fact they don't want the dollar to be strongly want it to be weak when it's strong that means less than the money out there means anything\nJust paper and they want it to be weak so the other money that's issued after and printed\nHas a little bit of value the difference here in crypto currency is that you never have to print it it's not inflationary it's deflation area so you take what you have and it gets divided down an out mentioned that\nYou don't lose the value you just give to divide it out which makes the value more which makes bitcoin a house the value or store value incredible once you get the concept damn\nThat's why I tell everybody is going to be the biggest shift in wealth in human history the biggest shipping weapons have been more millionaires and more billionaires made in the last twenty months then in the history of our country and that's not my I'm not making this up and go look at treasury dot Gov do all the research on your own just go out and do some research a\nLot of millionaires made out of this every single day anyway capitalism ... do which means the head so there has to be the rich there has to be the wealthy\nThey give the money to those who think and create\nSocialism die falls\nAnd creativity because it gives a guaranteed when you have a guarantee you stop thinking you have to have the rich the wealthy because why then people who are thinkers go hey I got an idea and the people\nThousand bitcoin that those two hundred thousand mic on one of the largest trade in the world\nBut anyway we're in the middle of it they do what's called the ... you know your customers so they did a background check and the buyer tells the cellar if climax he's not on the call we don't do the call [laughter]\nAnd then he told me after the call it goes can you blame\nCan you believe it or even in the middle of this and I said no ... and then I said well yeah I put you together I Know you I Know him yeah and putting it together I Know them I Know them putting them together thank you you know that's not what I'm Talking about I'm Talking about your background you fat little Indian [laughter]\nAt the high to sixty two and then another thirty so here's what I Would have done I Would have taken the fifty thousand and put twenty five thousand then there is because the one uh the one partner\nOnly had fifty grand so you don't want to put it all in one basket that didn't make sense at one time so I Would have taken twenty five thousand and bought and waited for the debt or wait for is there's nothing wrong with buying in the high either but it debt and went to dip to sixty two he would have the other twenty five thousand to buy and the debt\nSee how that works already had some more money out of incrementally bought another twenty five thousand either taken five thousand at a time and bought as incrementally went down but it took his bottom and then they pop back up again\nNow to sixty six Seventy one thirty or Ninety four that's what it is as we're speaking right this second so let's say that it goes up to now they're going to pull another\nUm Fifteen twenty thousand and they're going to pull their money together and I always recommend listen before you do anything talk to your financial advisor put pen to paper and\nSee what you're willing to risk the what you can risk ... without losing your everything you've got left gambling don't do that gambling don't don't don't don't don't don't do that gambling\nIs the worst thing you could do don't gamble crypto currency is the most conservative it's the most conservative purchase that you can make\nIf you start raising start paying attention start doing your due diligence you'll see that all the financial banks all the financial institutions all the banks are already putting money and they're already starting to put money investing into the block Jane\nThey're already starting to look at coins which one has substance behind them that means there's something behind the coin other than just putting money into a coin 'cause it's a coin\nSo I'm the\nAdministration was in contact with one of the coins this last week and we've been sending our ideas\nThey'll do that gambling don't don't don't don't don't don't do that\nIs the worst thing you could do don't gamble crypto currency is the most conservative it's the most conservative purchase that you can make\nIf you start raising start paying attention start doing your due diligence you'll see that all the financial banks all the financial institutions all the banks are already putting money and they're already starting to put money investing into the block chain\nThey're already starting to look at coins which one had substance behind them that means there's something behind the coin other than just putting money into a coin 'cause it's a coin\nSo I'm the\nAdministration was in contact with one of the coins this last week and we've been sending our ideas I Know I got a plan ... now White House says you're listening\nThere is a plant one of these days the economic systems are gonna crash and there's another plan there's a backup so ask crypto currency is becoming more credible there's going to be a back up to the monetary system because it can't last as it is nobody's buying the debt anymore what happens when nobody buys the dead anymore\nAnd think about that for a second no more debt cannot buy it no more money going through the system to pay for all of that so that they can print more money so that they can create more debt\nNow here's the difference in crypto currency because crypto currency and the block chain really is has made it makes the person the most unique again like it used to be not the banks why should the banks tried to verify who you are\nIn the credit agencies decide what you're going to get based on what they come up with\nThe way it used to be back in the day and I'm Talking a long time before we were ever born hundreds of years the person was the credibility\nThe person was the fact in the heart of the economy not the banks not to credit agencies nothing anything this fake are made up\nThey knew the person and they knew what that person had so\nThe block chained by the way Google is going to be history you watch the ... gonna be history let's do a little uh let's do a little history here and then I'm going to get back to that credit and why the security of the block chain makes all the different by the way the AMA block chain when they do a trade\nOr you're trying to pay somebody or they're trying to verify who you are the verification or the security is done first is done first go sign up for any exchange they do the security first a background check of who you are\nAnd then and then once they know who you are man you're allowed to get on\nThen they know who you are and then because it's on ... they'd have to be able to hack millions they can't change it\nSo nobody can come in because of their politics as for my friend Laurie up in Montana in any over here San Francisco that that you grow ladies\nPolitics can get involved none for my conservative buddy that here there is no they can't get politics involved is non political so once the facts are put in the security of who you are it's a done deal just a matter of moving so let let's look at this who was the top\nAnd then once they know who you are man\nYou're allowed to get on and then they know who you are and then because it's on ... they'd have to be able to hack millions they can't change it so nobody can come in because of their politics as for my friend Laurie up in Montana\nIn any over here\nIn San Francisco that that you grow you\nKnow politics can get involved none for my conservative buddy that here there is no they can't get politics involved is not political so once the facts are put in the security of who you are it's a done deal just a matter of moving so let's let's look at this\nWho was the top\nUniverse or who is the top companies ten years ago nobody know ten years ago last ten years the ... the top capitalization companies in the world Exxon\nWalmart\nKind of petroleum I used to buy all of those in trade him daily China bank not trying to bank but China petroleum traded them everyday Exxon everyday Walmart everyday I used to treat them every day\nBiggest capital of the nation companies in the world

sure they call us into will try to give them and for this uh I just on Saturday to free open audition but it'd be it'd be pretty cool\nWhere's it going to be as you\nIt's going to be right across the street from agency oh sorry to see is that basically twenty eighth street and Kendall back in the bill more there'll be right across the street at the Biltmore Hotel I'm Sorry the embassy suite so

right yeah yeah wow\nYeah I think you were telling me about him when we talked last night that's interesting so is that the embassy suite right across the street from where you are what times and start\nWell there's a couple of audition times but uh we we got it so ... ... it's\nIt's it's kind of filling up really fast I Would just say when people uh call well given the time but it's about eleven AM or two PM we just got to find out where we have availability but uh\nIt's it's a one day only Charlie so anybody again he was out they're interested in acting and that really cool thing is they can take beginning actors too or just people new to the industry um so you don't have to be a super status actor or they just look for um they don't know if you look for potential and that's what they did the same thing with the boy that's a star this movie\nI don't think he had ever acted before ever um parents just brought him in thought you know they had a cute kid and uh and now he's in star this major movies so um you know I'll just say anybody who's got the bus or the edge of the fever come on down and uh and and meet with some experts so\nYou've been in a what is your story yeah\nWell there's a couple of times but uh we we got it so ... ... it's\nIt's it's kind of filling up really fast so I'll just say when people uh call well given the time but it's about eleven am or two PM we just got to find out where we have availability but uh\nIt's it's a one day only Charlie so anybody again who's out they're interested in acting and that they're really cool thing is they can take beginning actors too or just people new to the industry um so you don't have to be a super status actor or they just look for um they don't know if you look for potential and that's what they the same thing with the boy that's a star this movie\nI don't think he had ever acted before ever um parents has brought 'em in thought you know they had a cute kid and uh and now he's in star this major movies so um you know I'll just say anybody who's got the ... the fever come on down and uh and and meet with some experts so you've been in eight\nWhat is your story yeah ... is is the way I'm going to be there\nYou know and I think she might be so found my youngest the owner of the agency and uh I think she's a show she might be there as well but uh uh it it seemed to have a we'll have a full house that's for sure\nOh maybe either like stopped there too and see it\nYeah more the merrier yeah like to get an idea that this is\nOne of those rare things where there's very few open auditions anymore any anytime you want to audition for a role for whether you want to be in the in the ad for the Sunday paper for when the stores or a commercial or whatever\nYou typically had to go through a casting director and nice to meet your pictures and you know hope they call you back this is one of those rare times where the the people are actually here in person so you ... you can just walk right up talk to them they can see you [laughter] I'm not done to electronically over email or whatever it's uh\nSo so that's why it's just it's it's a neat opportunity um anybody that's interested in that's all it is I highly encourage them to come down and uh um you know you you never know what happens we're just hosting them so it's not our event but we're hosting them but uh it's a really good opportunity\nYou know it's interesting let's talk about the modeling side [noise] because I Know there's quite a few jobs out there listening\nIn that are interested in the last time we

Americans or think progress had a um they ran an op ed from a woman a Cherokee woman who was progressive uh Rebecca a nod lay there and\nShe was not\nShe has always been and this was\nGosh this is a over a year ago she wrote is he an Cherokee woman one would assume that I Would take more inside and standing up against Trump's and I disagree that was a racist remark following the incident Warren lambasted the president telling MSNBC that Trump has done it over and over again thinking that he's going to shut me up\nAnd it hasn't worked in the past it's not going to work in the future a real Native American hero right wrong she was no hero to me when she failed to foster have enough support for native students with Harvard University's alienating Ivy League culture\nShe is not a hero for spending years awkwardly avoiding native leaders\nShe had not a hero despite claiming to be the only native woman in the U.S Senate she has done nothing to advance our rights she had not from us she does not represent us she is not Cherokee\nWow so\n... who are going to\nHave you ever notice the strategy though now and I've seen it though with this also used to take the smallest portion of something and make that the example like it's the it's the anecdotal no science behind it all you know to do that with\nYou know how many abortions are done because of Rick right less than one percent but they use that all the time of the reason for Ninety nine percent and it's now here with Elizabeth Warren she's using point zero nine percent of some premium back room to prove that somebody knows\nAll of this is is getting into because she ... she is strategy is posturing herself or twenty twenty or twenty twenty four and I I just don't think that's going to work by the way do you think that she's even going to be able to brush pass according bookers and Kamala Harris is I mean that's going to be a slap fight they're going to be a lot of bad blood there\nThere has been immersed in polling shows a well I was looking at this race in Nevada with Dean Heller and I don't know if it's a legit I haven't looked at the crosshairs of it um because in Nevada Dean Heller has been running second to the Democrat or like neck and neck it's been very very very tough\nThere was a new Emerson poll a that shows Heller winning I'm a bunch of different demos and ...\nAnd she's using point zero nine percent\nOf some premium back room to prove that somebody knows all in all of this is is getting into because she ... she is strategy is posturing herself for twenty twenty or twenty twenty four and I I just don't think that's going to work by the way do you think that she's even going to be able to brush pass a quarter bookers and Kamala Harris is\nI mean that's going to be a slap fight they're going to be a lot of bad blood there\nThere has been Emerson polling shows ah well I was looking at this race in Nevada with Dean Heller and I don't know if it's a legit I haven't looked at the crosshairs of it um because in Nevada Dean Heller has been running second to the Democrat or like neck and neck it's been very very very tough\nThere is a new Emerson poll that shows Heller winning I'm a bunch of different demos and it shows him pulling several points I've had several points ahead I don't I I think it it shows him seven points that I don't I think it's a lot tighter than seven points ahead\nUm and but apparently has the if the ... they call it the cabin off at a if Dean Heller does and I said this on the show before if Dean Heller does stay on\nAnd he he wins this race there's no way in Haiti's that Democrats will ever take over in the Senate ever at all so the the in Arizona and Montana and the Senate those are the um those are the races that everybody's that everybody's looking at\n'em and they're I mean they're pretty tight there pretty tight races there are number Texas a GOP is leading in Texas Tennessee or in Missouri I Can't even believe it or Missouri\nWas Claire McCaskill my gosh\nBut at the CBS battleground battleground poll that shows that the blue wave a the the back firing of the way Democrats handled Kavanaugh is hitting them harder the poll now they're starting we're starting to feel the tide has come in on that and it's starting to show up and all the polling data now\nBecause they do various you know sweep after sweep after sweet and now there is the possibility of\nBlue wave perhaps being neutralized\nBecause of the Kavanaugh fact I mean at least with the Senate for sure um\nAnd with the house it could be that's the same thing uh because now all of these different there are a couple of polls that show all of these different some of the racist sort of shifting a little bit\nUm and that is due to their really in saying I mean there's no way to put it they're they're completely insane way of of\nAh handling a the cabinet thing so\nThe whole hearing and and all of that stuff so and looking at this um\nBecause Biden is looking as though some people think Biden might stand up and twenty twenty and even if Biden stands up and twenty twenty there's a new CNN poll showing that Trump would likely still when if if if\nBiden ends up running on twenty twenty [noise]\nThere is I'm looking at a couple of different things here\nUh in addition to dean in addition to Dean Heller pulling ahead of Texas I'm Ted Cruz\nA Josh Hawley in uh Missouri now\nNBC News is showing that Democrats have a Latino problem and they're wondering why they're wondering why\nHispanics and Latino voters are not marching in line to go and vote for Democrats and they even know quote even with the Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke at the top of the Texas ticket it hasn't been easy Democrat officials say\nAnd how would it be easier if it was a white guy again he's a lizard was warning his way tried to what was it was warned his way into a seat he's trying to\nLikely still when if as if\nBiden ends up running on twenty twenty [noise]\nThere is I'm looking at a couple of different things here\nUh in addition to dean in addition to Dean Heller pulling ahead of Texas I'm Ted Cruz\nA Josh Hawley in uh Missouri now\nNBC News is showing that Democrats have a Latino problem and they're wondering why they're wondering why\nHispanics and Latino voters are not marching in line to go and vote for Democrats and they even know quote even with the Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke at the top of the Texas ticket it hasn't been easy Democrat officials say why\nAnd how would it be easier if it was a white guy again he was a warning his way trying to Elizabeth Warren his way into a seat he's trying to fake Hispanic his way into a seat this is crazy\nThey actually said that they actually said this\nThey're like we don't understand why in Texas Hispanics are more enthusiastic about data Rourke because he's white\nHow do you have how race it that is\nDo you get the impression that there is to me that because he copped a a Hispanic sounding nickname that that's going to make voters think that he's Hispanic\nI okay I'm All right [laughter]\nYeah it it's that but that is why betas doing data that's why he's doing it but to take over the house is starting to look a little bit more difficult to a dog we had to pull out that said a Democrat how when quote far from certain an elusive than it's nearly impossible\nUh the cabin all effect was disastrous for Democrats now there are still what we're silicon you know ... the weeks out so they I mean I don't know maybe they could maybe they could turn it around I don't but if I were still we're just now getting the first sort of\nIn the public's\nPerception of how Democrats handled Kavanaugh uh and and Trump his approval in his approval went up\nAnd because his approval went up and because there was a really negative reaction to the way voters saw Democrats handling the cabinet situation they're now going to transfer that onto Democrat candidate and that is going to be disastrous in states where it is too close to call\nIt is and then in the states where Republican candidates have been starting to pull away from Democrats they're going to have an even greater gap like in Tennessee was Marsha Blackburn up against Phil ... and\n... it wasn't always like that but Kavanaugh gave black burn a huge boost Kavanaugh has given Dean Heller a bit given cruiser boost it's given jobs Holly it'd be a a boost this was disastrous for them\nAnd by the way some people are are are\nI'm\nWatching this\nAnd wondering oh Jim Messina who work with rock Obama said why in the world that Elizabeth Warren cannot do them in a couple of weeks before the election wind a world of this woman do though he's he legit asked why did she do this\nRight so close to a a midterm election [noise]\nBecause that looks horrible\nThat could have a negative down ticket effect on in her state\nOh my gosh oh my gosh so yeah I mean\nIt is just bad all the way around it's bad all the way around it's just not going to it's not going to go so well for them paying\nYou know and it's it's weird to see how this is all trending right 'cause usually the messaging has always been a problem with public funds and right now they need to capitalize on his messaging and they're not doing still the media's got this narrative out there that's really driving a message for Democrats as though there's some sort of substance with what they're running on it\nSee now who work with rock Obama said why in the world that Elizabeth Warren come out and do them in a couple of weeks before the election wind

the media's got this narrative out there that's really driving a message for Democrats as though there is some sort of substance with what they're running on twenty twenty or even a bitter for them now but come on this is this was so obvious to me though I mean how crazy the media in on their side of some nuts\nMhm mhm message message messenger messaging\nAnd well and and I just I it just shows I think that there isn't a really good focus Democrats do not have a strong focus right now\nI'm we're concerned\nHow they're how they're running this this race or how they're running any of their races\nUm run against success successful economy all the things that people actually care about in this country which has their own money their own future how to put food on the table security

trying to make a point for the fact that markets although they can be cyclical we believed to be cyclical I Believe cycles can expand now what do I mean by that\nWhat I mean is is that if you have one dollar it only takes one dollar to be a hundred percent return a hundred percent return on one dollars a dollar\nSo the cycle can go from burning you ten percent return which is ten cents\nTo a twenty percent return which is twenty cents down to a nothing returned very easily\nBut what if you're earning not a dollar but you're earning a hundred thousand dollars\nYou would think that it would make sense of ... it would be just as easy to go from you know ten percent return which will be ten thousand dollars and twenty percent return which is twenty thousand you would think those numbers all ally\nBut I'm suggesting you those numbers to not align the larger the number is the harder it is to get it to move\nThat's a strange concept but I Believe this my whole life I've noticed back when I was buying real estate when I first started those by very very expensive stuff cheap stuff old stuff worn out stuff and I could earn twenty thirty percent return on cash flow from day one but it was only paying ten thousand dollars a unit for that stuff\nBut when you got up to where you're paying\nTwenty thousand it was twice as hard to get the income to go up\nBy the same percentage when you pay thirty was three times as hard and now that we're looking up anywhere from eighty and I've actually looked this up myself now in the last two years from a hundred and twenty last week I looked at what to\nIs the harder it is to get it to move\nThat's a strange concept but I Believe this my whole life I've noticed back when I was buying real estate when I first started those by very very inexpensive stuff cheap stuff old stuff worn out stuff and I could earn twenty thirty percent return on cash flow from day one but it was only paying ten thousand dollars a unit for that stuff\nBut when you got up to where you're paying\nTwenty thousand it was twice as hard to get the income to go up by the same percentage when you pay thirty was three times as hard and now that we're looking at stuff anywhere from eighty and I've actually looked at stuff myself now in the last two years from a hundred and twenty\nLast week I looked at what two hundred thousand dollars a door\nNow you've got to think about that how do you make that kind of percentage change when something's two hundred thousand dollars a door when someone's paying thirty five hundred and four thousand dollars a month rent\nHow'd you raise the rebel let's say I raised in a hundred bucks that's nothing percentage wise where when people were paying four hundred dollars a month rent and I raise it to five hundred that was a twenty five percent rate increase but a hundred and thirty five hundred is nothing\nSo what I'm suggesting you is this cycle has scaled to the point where the returns have got to go down because the cost of getting into the business is so high\nYet at the same token the cycle has expanded so we're we take you X number of days to get from point a to point B and then to point see an end to point the and then to hit the end of the cycle and come back to point again the debt period of time has to change\nIt has to change almost directly with the size of the change because it takes longer to make those larger changes large enough to send the cycle through it's loops\nNow this is just projection this is my theory\nNo economists out there or a spouse in this um espousing that because I sat back now for twenty seven years and had to watch every single years my members and Best Buy real estate year after year after year and every once in a while every like four years ago actually we are peaking in this market is probably going to be over by next year\nAnd the next you have to go you know what I think we are the\nLast year I decided to sell my real estate property so 'cause I thought we had gone past the peak and we were on the edge of a bubble while I was selling Curtis was by\nWe discuss their notes we share notes and although I got out of historic highs be able to get back in I'm going to have to get back into his or ties\nSo let's take a look at some of the numbers will start was single family I work this whole seminar not dissimilar talk radio show will work this through two departments let's start with single\nFamily house right now first time homebuyers are thirty two percent of all the buyers and the problem with that is is that\nThey don't build small houses anymore let me give you an example the median home right now it's two hundred and forty eight thousand dollars the average home is three hundred and thirty one thousand dollars that let's go back to when I bought my first call\nI purchased my first rental property at twenty five thousand dollars at the time the media and was fifty dollars All right so let's think about this I bought it at fifty cents on the media will the media is two hundred and forty\nThat means we can buy houses a hundred and twenty and still be buying them at the same\nSingle family house right now first time homebuyers are thirty two percent of all the buyers and the problem with that is is that\nThey don't build small houses anymore let me give you an example the median home right now it's two hundred and forty eight thousand dollars the average home is three hundred and thirty one thousand dollars now let's go back to when I bought my first call\nI purchased my first rental property at twenty five thousand dollars at the time the median was fifty dollars right so let's think about this I bought it at fifty cents on the media will the media is two hundred and forty\nThat means we can buy houses a hundred and twenty and still be buying them at the same the same discount I was buying at the bottom of a recession in other words when it was the absolute best time to buy when the world had exploded and things were going for fifty cents on the dollar I was buying a fifty cent to the median price\nWell guess what folks who are still buying houses eighty Ninety a hundred thousand dollars hundred and ten a hundred and twenty all day long which\nIs below fifty percent of the median price\nWe are killing it and not realizing it because those prices are higher than we've ever been willing to pay in the investment world\nBut not understanding that the step is being built is higher than it's ever cost in history and the people coming out to buy their home now the first time home they're looking at prices two hundred and forty thousand\nTwo hundred and and I\nAnd so who are these first time homebuyers these are the millennials twenty five to thirty thirty five years of age got their first big paying job maybe just got married or have a you know relationship maybe had their first baby and they're living with mom and dad they got to get out\nBut to get out they got to come up with the price of a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home\nThat's a big chunk to pay for it really is\nI remember when I got out I burst home I bought was a condo for forty thousand bucks and I mean forty thousand compared to two hundred and forty thousand I Know it's Thirty years later forty years later whatever it is but it's still massively different\nSo how does that hook up with the apartment is back when I first got in the apartment business or buying apartments that were old worn out tired low and stuff for ten thousand dollars a door the highest out this stuff I really want to do but I couldn't afford it was like forty thousand fifty thousand\nAnd the median home prices back then or like a hundred thousand dollars\nSo because I remember I got out of single family houses because single family house as the media went to Seventy five thousand Seventy six thousand somewhere I said man is the housing business just getting too expensive and you can't buy a house for Seventy six thousand dollars and make any money with it so I went to apartments where I could buy these old beat of apartments for cheap and picked him up and make some money with\nMedia what to Seventy five dollars and Seventy six thousands of what I said man is the housing business just get too expensive or you can buy a house for Seventy six thousand dollars and make any money with it so I went to apartments record buddies will be the apartments were cheating picked him up and make some money with\nAnd the fact that there's tons of cash sitting around waiting to get into these deals usually been more buying the silk as the millennials come out in the world changes from you know an old folks right to the millennials\nThey now have the belief that they don't necessarily want to own a home\nThey don't like upkeep they've been living with their parents have been ten it's for the first Thirty years of their life now to be ten it's with freedom of not living in mom and dad's house it's like total freedom they're spoiled and they want nice amenities so they can't afford to buy a little crappy home and a crappy neighborhood they're not going to do that\nThis all leads them to demand as more and more millennials are wanting to move in to the household world in other words owned their own household by themselves\nThere's more and more demand for apartments and not as much demand for houses because they can't afford to buy those houses\nThey don't have the buying power to buy those expensive houses twenty five percent down or not I think ... rocket five percent down but you have to be able to stand for the mortgage payments you have to pay for all the maintenance repair mowing the yard all utilities the whole bit\nSo it is sending demand over to the apartment industry so there's more demand for the apartment industry\nAnd the apartment industry is putting up more supply so what happened in two thousand eight when the recession yet they stopped building so to nine to ten to Lebanon\nNot until about two twelve did you start seeing apartments come back on line and when they did there was a shortage of apartments there was a shortage of housing for many years so what happens is boom big giant swinging the pedal and everybody jumps and start building stuff\nBut they're building class and race there is no more class bees and class he's they stopped even naming anything a class de if it's a building it's a classy now even if it's a piece of garbage and bad part of town the only classy they've eliminated the designation de\nBecause everything that you could put a human being in his rent a boat in this day and age\n[noise] that's a market shift folks I mean when I got the businesses were days there was stuff that people shouldn't live in and they're not even condemning it any more they're going to get anything you put a body and nowadays is a sea that's blue collar living wow tell me this market hasn't changed\nShortage of apartments there was a shortage of housing for many years so what happens is boom big giants wing of the pedal and everybody jumps and started building stuff\nBut they're building class ace there's no more class bees and class ease they stopped even naming anything a class de if it's a building it's a classy now even if it's a piece of garbage and bad part of town to call the classic David limited the designation de\nBecause everything that you could put a human being in his rent a bomb in this day and age\n[noise] that's a market ship books I mean when I got in the businesses were days there was stuff that people shouldn't live in and they're not even condemning it any more they're going to get anything but a body and nowadays is a sea that's blue collar living wow\nTell me this market hasn't changed told me the curb hasn't changed a cycle hasn't changed\nIt's unbelievable what else control supply and demand how about jobs it's talk about jobs we're ... we're right now at the lowest unemployment level since twenty thirty forty fifty years ago I don't know what it was but it's been a long time\nLess than four percent you're now in a situation we were when I was growing up where it was called um under employment in other words there's no is it over ... over ... there's so many people have jobs and so many jobs wanting people that it's a wonder we don't have inflation\nWhatever they're doing the fed is doing something that's holding down inflation fairly well because now it's going to be driven by the fact that people you start getting higher wages\nNow married that with what Donald Trump just in\nThis new tax law is going to change things dramatically companies are going to make twenty five percent more money than they were paying forty two percent tax at the corporate level now they're paying twenty five\nAnd it's a fifty percent cutting taxes guys these companies are going to be gushing with cash so when there's a lack of people to work for them when they're trying to expand these wonderfully profitable businesses they're going to have to offer higher wages\nI had my staff come to me already so you know I think we have a higher offer offer higher wages for people even like our entry level people you know a receptionist and stuff a lot more money now because you can go out in the street and wow it's happening\nSo people are going to have more money right so there's going to be more money to buy with buying indexes are all on\nConsumer indexes that study how people feel about the future they're all up\nEverybody except the talking heads on TV Democrats believe that Trump is going to blow this thing apart it's going to become incredibly positive for everybody because you don't believe in trickle down economics that's fine I I get that\nBut the bottom line is when there's more money out there and there's less job or there's more jobs than there are people wages have to go up\nAnd we're going to go for everybody to matter with your white black Hispanic Chinese Indian wages are going up\nAnd so you've got this perfect storm\nWhere the economy is booming where we're at the point in the cycle when you say the cycle should be shutting down now it should be over\n\nIt's the beginning of a new peak because revenue Trump did wow think of that now one more thing they've slowed down the amount of new apartment complex was coming\nBecause you don't believe in trickle down economics that's fine I I get that but the bottom line is when there's more money up there and there's less job or there's more jobs than there are people wages have to go up and we're going to go up for everybody to meddle with your white black Hispanic Chinese\nIndian wages are going up and so you've got this perfect store where the economy is booming we're at the point in the cycle when you say the cycle should be shutting down now it should be over\nBut it's the beginning of the new peak because wherever the Trump did\nThink of that no one more thing they've slowed down the amount of new apartment complex was coming on line two thousand Eighteen will bring less product are lined the two thousand Seventeen did your two thousand eighty we'll have more demand\nMore to man less supply higher reds higher occupancy is it's covered books it's all happening right before us the economists are saying it and they're basically holding their breath going I Can't predict what\nThis is going to do because it doesn't make sense and I don't want to be wrong I'm sitting here right now saying I'm willing to be wrong it's happening it's

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking of a two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on and talking about how people were losing trust in institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was there were only two groups\nI look at the sheer vitriol and hatred on both sides\nIn what's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Ford and all the rest of it and I don't care which side to that argument Iran first of all if you both firmly believe one side or the other ... you have to realize we don't really have a lot of facts okay\nAnd you can they say will then that means act so that means y understand all that\nBut real lined the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump amount of anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong but if I were to happen\nI Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through an whole cabinet opting and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious\nAnd just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the idea this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is before the market goes down you gotta know what\nTrump I Want the country to work okay but I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people were predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong but if that were to happen\nI Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings\nAnd it's

my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious\nAnd just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the idea this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach but the idea of this is\nBefore the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down and then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and have you ever notice a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and told me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors well defined investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders real life that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble they put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong\nAnd again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay the problem is is that when the market turned down a can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month the market wants Thirteen Years of game think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay if you want Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so again in class we're going to talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people will focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... the camp sticks in your are your uh see the eyes and ears on hold for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at average is\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of the guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecasters really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing\nAnd you're only looking at averages ... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got a I won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two\nAnd he was you know given

is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now\nAnd the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes\nAnd that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but\nIt's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market is supply and demand it's buying and selling

was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make there's a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most

to Nineteen Ninety [noise]\nThere's some other things out there right now the indicate that the market may well be near a top\nTo getting into to those ideas and just a couple of minutes but\nThe to me the key is you have to know what to do before things go bad if you wait till they go bad is it happens way too fast and you can't react in time\nYou've got to be position before it happens now when the markets falls I mentioned the market when it fell in two thousand eight two thousand nine the market and the U.S and the gay backs Thirteen Years of profits in the year and a half\nThat how fast these markets fall when the market fell in two thousand and two fourteen years to get back to two thousand level and that was short a lotta times it takes twenty and twenty five years and people say well you know I've got this long ... investment horizon\nMost people's investing horizon it's thirty five to forty years and if you lose twenty or twenty five years and you because you didn't protect yourself and you didn't make the money to the downside\nThat's very very hard than for people to achieve their goals\nSo we're going to be talking about how do we identify the prices would you begin to to ... like Goldman Sachs or people like Warren Buffett are buying at\nYou know when he was buying apple it a hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty five and now it's sitting in about two twenty five that would have been a useful piece of information and if you knew what you were looking for you could have seen it and I will show that to you in fact when you come to class asked me to show you why I think that about where he was fine apple\nThose kinds of things are incredibly important pieces of information the next thing is just understanding the basic mechanics\nOf how do I want to actually make money when this stuff goes down how do I make money when it goes up and down and still protect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invested in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and forty eight hours of every weekend you cannot protect yourself\nYes you can use options to limit your losses but you're still going to have laws okay if you had homeowner's insurance and it only covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay\nAnd my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I run I've talked to a class before is always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those would be that have children if you can get them to understand\nProtect myself from the market's close\nTo one of the things that people don't always consider is that they invested in stocks because they think they're safe stocks or some of the riskiest things people can put their money into because their markets only open six and a half hours a day Seventeen and a half hours of every day and

covered you for six and a half hours a day would you feel like you were protected I think most people would not okay\nAnd my dad's the situation people in in the market so again to me this is an incredibly important class and I will I run I've taught this class before it's always one of the most popular ones\nAnd I just it's a really important class and those will be that have children if you can get them to understand how the markets work when they're young they can always take care of themselves\nThey the world is changed in my opinion from a market every no manufacturing world to a service economy to a financial economy it's all about just transferring assets now and if you understand how that world really works you can always make money\nAnd the problem is is most people don't most people think it's about studying companies or looking at it charged with looking it indicators which are the wrong thing\nThere is a fundamentally better approach again that I was teaching class so if you want to come out and get to free tickets free tablet plus we'll feed you launch be one of the next dozen callers\nAt eighty four forty eight trader that's T.

will be cool okay\nTourists to the market but let's talk about some signs for that may be nearing atop\nFirst and it was during the wall Street Journal today\nThat of the companies that are going public this year eighty three percent of them are losing money\nNow that is the highest in recorded history anytime they've tracked this this is the biggest number of it's ever been is now a clipped what was happening in the year two thousand or eighty one percent of the companies were not profitable\nWhen companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation\nThere what are known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that\nCharles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market it's supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then\nWhat's going to take the market up to the next level\nProfitable when companies are going public and then the stocks are going up which many of these stocks are where there are these ridiculous evaluation there would've known as unicorn stock these companies that have no profits that are worth a billion dollars or more\nThat is a sign of a bubble and that is a sign that we are closer to the end than we are to the beginning of this Ron\nThere's another story I just read that\nCharles Schwab investors which a classic retail traders are now sitting on less cash than they've been at any time in history so they're becoming quote unquote fully invested well that is a lot of implications what drives the market it's supply and demand if you've taken away the demand\nAnd there isn't more money on the sidelines to kind of come in and then what's going to take the market up to the next level\nNow what's been taking it up is companies buying back their own stock and companies are buying back a record amount of stock this year they've never bought so much and that constrains supply and that could drive this market higher again\nThis is I don't want to be giving you some big doom and gloom thing this market can keep going higher than the repatriation of all that money coming back from overseas is a huge part of what's driving this market higher\nNow it's a one time deal but some of the people aren't spending the money this year they're going to spend it next year so maybe you've done a little bit left in the tank next year but at some point it has to come down and again we need to be prepared for that before it happened we got to have the fundamental skills to be able to benefit from this happened\nBecause you can actually make more money faster on the downside than the upside but at a minimum we've got to know how to protect what we've got so again the classroom and to be teaching on before\nThe crash what do you do and also what we're going to cover is what does he keeps going up what should we be doing there's always a way to make money in this market but we always have to start with risk management\nAgain be one of the next dozen callers you can get to free tickets free tablet when you come out the number to call is eight for for eight eight seven twenty three thirty seven

there's the right side of the trade right side of the trade is brought you buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education All right this week we've been talking\nAbout the ... kind of the state of the market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon\nYou know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year\nAnd we don't we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this year and you could look anything's possible you could even get a bit of a run next year\nBut what's going to keep taking this market higher and in the last segment I told you a little bit about what I see an evidence of the top and the market one of the fact that more companies are going public selling shares initial public offering demand ... cattle\nMore companies that have no profit than\nEver in history so Wall Street journal today to the eighty three percent of the company\nThe ... kind of the state of the market and why I think we're closer to the top than the bottom at this point by a very long way and in fact why you may see a top in this market pretty soon\nYou know early this year I said I thought you'd see the top this year and he will we haven't really gone much above where we were in January kind of gone back and forth around there\nYou know I said we could have one more run this

history so Wall Street journal today to eighty three percent of the company's going public right now have an earnings were gone public the last twelve months no earnings\nIn two thousand the height of the dot com it was eighty one percent so that again is kind of a big bubbly sign\nNext big bubbly sign that the fact that you go to a place like Charles Schwab where it's retail traders not professionals okay they have their customers have less cash sitting on the sidelines than they've had an ad I think it anytime and history if I remember correct\nBut they don't have a lot of extra money now you combine that with something else we've talked about before on the show which is what's called margin debt\nRight now in this country people are barred about six hundred and sixty billion dollars to buy stocks that's about three and a quarter percent of gross domestic product the entire US Economy\nSo what's happening is people are taking the money they have been buying stocks because most people are massively behind the eight ball you know and trust and the other day\nThat if you look at people even in their sixties\nThe average person had something like a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and assets okay hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars is going to get you anywhere with all due respect in retirement to really get to where most people need to be you're talking millions which means most people aren't going to get where they need to be you can still do better but you know most people are going to be in the hole on that\nA hundred and Seventy five it's not

I said well honey I really can't help you that much with your ... but by the way how much does it\nAnd when she said it was over five hundred dollars thank God I was sitting down 'cause I couldn't afford to have another accident\nAnd I said ... you have a little tiny house how is your purview however build these so high\nI said there must be some kind of a mistake and a lot of people listening today that are getting these really high electric bills and heart goes from a PS ... 'cause atheists mentor people had some news or the summer [noise]\nUm I said there's got to be a mistake ... let's let's take a look at the bill\nSo when I looked at her bill and I actually realize that there was no mistake and what she was paying per kilowatt for her power\nAnd all the fees and the taxes in surcharges and she only had my two little grandbabies at that point and I said oh no\nThis is the house that she's going to be in for another twenty or twenty five years and this power bills never going down it's never going to go when it's never going down the only thing it's gonna do you keep on increasing [noise]\nI said I've got to help the help help her out here\nI couldn't pay it and I couldn't pet that month and I couldn't pay them next month or the months after that I had to figure out a solution for her so I rolled up my sleeves and I started looking online lower electric bills lower power builds a lead the lights came up super cooling came up\nAnd what that is it's a PS created these amazing rate plan's selling us the same power\nFrom last year differently and now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to them on and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that too right in them and and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us how much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy managed\nNew um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight yeah it is the hardest time of the day between three and a pimp and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this is because I understand what the power companies in a monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest some of the day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five [noise]\nThere's no place to go except to them on and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way that the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is remember when we have landlines and the telephone company said if you use your land line to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay a better rate\nWill their telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist no matter when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when it's hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added onto our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you [laughter] I said the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's going to continue to go up\nAnd now I've walked in my own power rate for my own home\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't

I'm at the getting to know you ... that is going to make it so that you are affect you you are if they shouldn't with your time and you will get more business 'cause isn't that the purpose of these\n... absolutely and and you know one thing I Want you to bring up also because you said don't show at these meetings and that goes to the purpose is where the person to understand what you do\nSo you can refer to them you know I might not necessarily want to have your product or service if I Need it great in this way I could refer you even better 'cause I don't know how well you do

really really want to I wanted to hammer home on that one you can continue now cat\nThinking I'm you know that that's really important and and I think um you know if we take a step back too often um we go\nShe networking meetings and we go to all these different things and we think um oh here's one person you know let let me let me uh\nLet me a hunter not a not a former here's one person let me

that trial adept at your rolodex so before you have the need to\nSet up some parameters you want to know the purpose of the meeting what are you trying to do um\nFor example you want to know are you guys um are you guys are looking to set up a joint venture partnership you refer people to me I refer people you\nAre you looking to see where your similarities are maybe a you use something similar and you overlap and if you are if you're meeting with somebody who's a very similar business you that's not a bad thing because they can't serve\nThe whole world and you can't serve the whole world I think I'm probably the best example the insurance people there\nI think so there's so many different types of insurance [noise] um and there are so many brokers out there that do every kind of served a insurance property casualty light helps you name it they do it however\nThey are not experts at all of them or they don't like to join a particular kind so yeah there may be overlap but they're talking to another insurance agent would have gotten insurance agent does what they don't like to do\nIt's great now hey I could ... because I hate human life insurance but you love doing life insurance and metal works both ways it's it's a lot of restaurants to be right there\nThat's right so the first thing that you need to do is to set up\nAhead of time what this meeting is going to be about what you want to talk about you know what the end goal is everything else we do in life I not in life in business not unlike sometimes you do things for the sake of doing it but in business everything that we do we should have an end goal in mind\nWe should have ... in the end goal is not to sell them\nBut we have an end goal in mind we want to create a relationship we want to be able to refer people over to you we want to create a partnership what ever that end goal is set up that and go ahead of time and then make the higher a needing\nDirected toward that end goal\nAnd make sure the other person knows what the end goal is I think that's important going in if you both are not on the same page and you're going to\nHave conversations that go all over the place but if you have if you're both on the same page you could focus on what it is that you want to accomplish out of this meeting you can get it done and now mind you typically these meetings or an hour long a\nGovern strict\nThey know what I'm hearing to be and they don't have to be but we can talk about\nThat in the next segment our first step now is going to be getting agreement as to what this meeting is gonna be so getting agreement on the meeting I'm having an end goal in mind in the meeting I think is going to be the first step in having a really effect is\nEfficient or one to one meeting and getting more business\nAnd I also would to just do a little homework ahead of time from questions uh try to understand what this other person does but\nWhen you can do that by looking on the line that what their website however when you're sitting down with them you might find it something a little bit different so hostile questions in mind\nYou can get it done and now mind you typically these meetings
