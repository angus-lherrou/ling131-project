eight percent success rate in the levy aiding or completely unlimited eating pain issues that people have lived with for years\nVery rarely I Do get somebody who has a degenerative disc or uh\nSome disk related problem that's beyond what I can do but I normally can get them some relief to 'cause most of the time it's the type muscles that are pulling the vertebrae together\nAnd causing more pain 'cause the bones are being held tight together\nIt's just like low back pain is normally you're psychotic nervous Isaac nerve is the biggest nerve or your body comes it comes out of the spine at the tail bones and comes down to ... down the back of the leg and so underneath the gluteus maximus he got a dozen muscles under their\nGive everybody knows the gluteus maximus the big part of your rear end there but there's also a gluteus media so gluteus ... and all these things are right on that ... nerve so when you got tension and that muscle you get nothing that muscle when you've got nuts on that muscle it's sending signals up or down that muscle\nAnd causing pain numbness cramps and the Cavs that's when a real common cause you got two types in her she got sensory nerves then you've got motors the sensory nerves send the signal back to your brain tell you what's going on the motor nerve so the single down to the muscle and tell it hey move\nAnd if it's on ... century nerve\nYou got a

I said kind of nice to not have a headache isn't it and she goes this is so weird I forgot what it felt like not to have a headache\nBecause she had had a headache every single day for Eighteen years\nAnd another a lady last year when I worked at one of those other massage places and we we kept notes on the computer we number down you know after we work on somebody what ... what we did what

glorified\nSexuality free expression ...\nThe accent of women\nAnd so the liberal why our government\nWas so akin to what we're having an America today\nThe people felt good about it prostitution was they criminalize\nDrug so rampant\nLaws against venereal disease were dropped\nJust as an America would dropping laws against using heroin now\nFirst they called an injection drug use now in San Francisco there actually giving junkies drugs to use can you believe this what else happened in the ... republic that is akin to what's happening in America today\nWeekend police authority\nRamping lawlessness arose because the liberal agenda led to weaken policing the criminals subtly proliferated\nCouldn't buy firearms\nPeople were not allowed to have firearms\nElse happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash\nThe backlash to this liberalism\nRight now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany and you have groups like on the far the Berman cowards you put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street\nAttacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are with impunity but we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with a communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler World War a reaction\nCouldn't buy firearms\nPeople were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened well I can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash\nThe backlash to this liberalism\nRight now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany and you have groups like on the far the Berman cowards are put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street\nAttacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity but we had the same thing that the world and seeing the same thing in Germany and the into war period with the communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler we're we're a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards now don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown shirts I Am simply giving you a piece of history and lessons for mystery remember when I set the many times those that do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing\nWhat do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world where this will lead\nAnd I see where this really\nSo just like on the far today and the Occupy movements of today which are lawless and violent the kiss of today\nHad gone by Nancy Pelosi says we're all just raptors same thing there so the communists weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they're attacking the Republicans now senators no one stops them\nIt's just not what powers to ... to protect ourselves from these ...\nSo the Germans said enough is enough so what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one along with tremendous money from the aristocracy that we're still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units coal brown shirts\nAnd they started beating a communist in the streets\nThat's what happened I didn't say it should happen there don't condemn what I Am saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you're gonna be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story\nBiggest as this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc\nAnd the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they shared the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute\nOf reality what I'm telling you\nThe average person cheered on the brown stretches so more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies\nAnd opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing\nAnd so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong costs to laugh with like you to think he said listen the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash\nOrder and they shared the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute\nOf reality what I'm telling you\nThe average person shared on the brown shirts or more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies\nAn opposition from the right wing\nThe larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing\nSo that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong because the left for like you to think he said the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his delusions for example to block the immigration\nOf criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass those liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench they may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this\nAnd so what is what is the point in my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut its solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left which say any of us illusions are extreme to the left said that Kavanaugh was a drunk which he wasn't a cabinet was a rapist what she was and and he drank too much beyond what college student and you know and you didn't\nWhat did they do in college what uh Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat he's doing he drank rather sham it's drank too much about the shepherd says well what do you know what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy and went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly elaboration\nWhat I'm saying to us history as a very good\nIndicator of what's coming\nThings go around and cycles\nSo when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the less than a super liberalism is a good thing for this country and the west\nYou're a hundred percent wrong\nYou're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that\nShe this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nThings will happen that you can't believe\nAre happening and what happens so fast she'll say it's not happening\nAnd liberalism will be there is the reason for it\nYou say it can happen here\nWell it will happen here\nAnd the economic downturn that as being predicted by some economists is a is inevitable it's going to happen that I'm afraid if it happens it'll be worse than ever biggest where the heightened now of the stock market\nThe inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money\nAnd under the Democrats when we criticize\nDeficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatism dummy up they shut their mouths you but on your anyone in the radio\nTalking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nNo not one person\nThey all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey don't want to get a tour of the oval [noise]\nBut someone's gotta say stop printing the money this is crazy\nBecause someone's gonna have to pay for that\nAnd after all it's gonna happen that I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever biggest were the heightened now of the stock market\nThe inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money\nAnd under the Democrats when we criticize\nDeficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatism dummy up they shut their mouths you but you're anyone in the radio\nTalking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nNo not one person\nThey all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the oval\nBut someone's gotta say stop printing the money this is crazy\nBecause someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever\nYou want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as\nHappened in why mark Germany at the end just before all of this that it takes a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how fabulous the money had become now several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company\nHas not remove the personal attack reviews on that book at all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will\nYou'll find all the negative reviews left up there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America as some of them posted by other means of Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teaches us anything there are cycles too at kind of me there are cycles to a political views\nAnd I pray that as I ride on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the ones Greg United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we'll sink even deeper\nAnd we may well do it without hysteria because Americans by than traditional Americans hardworking roll up your sleeves Americans will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed sound familiar will be too tired and feel to consistently betrayed to dispirited to fight back page three oh three\nStop mass hysteria be right back\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are listening to independent voters eleven hundred to eight great for you to do this you know premier radio station the home of the nation as an accident was a

pleasure to be with you on a First Amendment friday night you know\nWhen we talk about the cabinet confirmation you wonder do some of the young people who are following this especially those who are already of voting age do they have some you know basically from grass on what it is this going on well documentary filmmaker army a horror which is very good at taking the temperature of some of these people\nAnd he found that gullible ignorance well is really shocking when you documented out their army welcome back to the program how are you\nI'm doing well always a pleasure beauty allies that way but I'm I'm doing very well I'm doing much better after I saw the vote tomorrow unless things change is going to be fifty one forty nine that we're going to see judge Kavanaugh confirmed I think he deserves it\nI think the president has the authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice and I think he picked a supremely qualified individual I'm Sorry that judge Kavanaugh on his family had to go through all this nonsense a story that we've we've finally come to find out was fraudulent ah and and that there were people willing\nTo urge others to lie to the FBI to back this up and I told a candidate the other day I should realize this kind of bomb could be dropped on your candidate tomorrow's talking to a member of the staff of this campaign\nAnd I said what are you going to do if a work week out from election day this kind of bomb has dropped on you and you know it's not true and you know you can probably prove it's not true but you won't be able to prove that in any way shape or form till after the election this technique\nShould not be used by either party I think it should be condemned if there's a a real person who's been harmed in assaulted more power to them their story should be hurt but if you decided to simply drop a story knowing by the time they check it out and find out its faults uh the the election will be over and there's no way to undo it that's wrong so\nTell me about what you did with young people to try and find out of college kids find out their point of view on all this\nYeah ... that's clearly a lot of opposition to to Kavanaugh on on the left right no question about it and you you know the story is ... continue to come out of the cabinet I it is that we went from you know he was a conservative they don't like\nTo hear the gang spray like sixty yup so I Want to see what\nThose two parts to it at first I wanted to find out what to what what they believe what\nNot be used by either party I think it should be condemned if there is a a real person who's been harmed in assaulted more power to them their story should be hurt but if you decided to simply drop a story knowing by the time they check it out and find out it's false or the the election will be over there is no way to undo it that's wrong so\nTell me about what you did with young people to try and find out of college kids find out their point of view on on this\nYeah ... that's clearly a lot of opposition to to Kavanaugh on on the left right no question about it and you you you know the stories can continue to come out about cabinet I did this you know we went from you know he was a conservative they don't like 'em\nTo ah here's a gang rape it's right here to sixty yup so I Want to see what\nThose two parts to it at first I wanted to find out what to what they believe what idiocy can I make up their so obviously falls to see if they would believe that are Republican candidate for any office only the Supreme Court would believe so I began with with something I said you know\nA cabinet during the hearings he he felt that uh we needed to take a black man's value to be worth three fits the white men value right and one of the most ridiculous things you could possibly imagine right All right they're going to laugh myself out here a lot of the whole\nUh every single person I approached believed that he said a black person is worth three fifths of a white person\nNow by the way reminds everybody where the three fifths figure actually comes from an American history\nIt's called the three fifths compromise and what happened was when there was the faith in the south in the north to predict to figure out on a census basis how many people you know what what what was the the um\nHow how many people were in North from the south of the country as a whole there was there was an agreement to count black people's three fiscal a white person because it was actually the north who pushed that because they didn't want the south are saying well you know their slaves we want to count them as citizens therefore we'll have more people than the north and that says you have the cave this week is compromise\nYeah so it has a reference in American history but it goes back a long long way there were actually college kids who believe that the the Kavanaugh are held that position that the black citizens were only three fifths of a person\n... every single person and then I Want to see if I taught myself so then I said well he also wants to take a listen everybody is concerned that he's so dangerous to women's rights when you hear that all the time he is absolutely dangerous to women's right\nSo I wanted to see okay let's see how far they go to believe how how big a danger he wasn't even though he said that he thought that roe versus Wade was Supreme Court precedent than he wouldn't take that away they still\nDidn't believe him and he was a danger to women's rights in general I said okay let me see how far we can take that and I said well\nDid you know that he wanted to take a woman's right to vote away of course nobody believes that large well except that they all believe that and not a single person to push back and they all use it as an example to say why the terrible person\nThat's insane and these are not high school kids these are college age kids so they finished K through ... education they'd been admitted to an American college they're supposed to be smart enough to study in college some of the people you talked to had a year or two in college and they still thought crazy things like that\nThat's right that's how much they're arrangement syndrome about Republicans in general are are that's how significant the situation is because they still would have believed that no matter what that helped her way they are how how brainwashed they are when it comes to American and to what they think Republicans stand for\nAnd and I guess the really frightening thing for me is that these\nWell except that they all believe that and not a single person I pushed back and they all use it as an example to say why the terrible person\nThat's insane and these are not high school kids these are college age kids so they finished K. through twelve education they'd been admitted to an American college they're supposed to be smart enough to study in college some of the people you talked to had a year or two in college and they still thought crazy things like that\nThat's right that's how much they're arrangement syndrome about Republicans in general are are that's how significant the situation is because they still want to believe that no matter what how their ways they are how how brainwashed they are when it comes to American and to what they think Republicans stand for\nWell and then I guess the really frightening thing for me is that\nThese people who consume mass media if they turn on CNN and and you know or MSNBC or read the New York times the Washington Post ah they will see stories that some of us said that it's hogwash I can show you the documents that show you the thing that you just read\nIn the Washington Post isn't true even NBC or got caught exaggerating some of what a Christine\nFor to had to say to Congress and they were called on it but if you don't know to call somebody on it or to go out and look it up yourself and see if that could possibly be true and you're used to consuming maybe two or three sources of media not double checking them you might be just completely taken for that are taking with that information\nNo question about it and by the way as crazy as that is that wasn't the most dangerous thing that they answer all of the most well was it ...\nIt when it got worse wasn't it has to locate so clearly you don't you know you don't want a Republican I get it why not let me ask you this question I asked them to or questions I said well what is what is the role what should be the role of Supreme Court should it be what it actually is right\nConstitutionally that to interpret\nThe constitution or should they simply be promoters of social just we all know there's only one answer to this question okay every single kid I had every still in critical professors their answer was promotion of social justice\nThat is the role of the Supreme Court and then to take a step further to believe if you still can't believe we couldn't get a fertile at this but we did I asked them\nIf the constitution even that was a team that you want to you you want to try to suppress the role of the constitutional comes Supreme Court want social justice so let's ask the question what what relevance doesn't have to you and the answer was for most people eighty percent of the kid that spoke to said it had no real well\nNo relevant even though on a daily basis they engage in free speech\nOr they are secure in their belongings the police can't just pull you out of your house and demand your papers as you walk down the street all of those things are things that are\nLocked up in the constitution as safeguards against the government overreaching and doing things to citizens that the government should not be doing they didn't see that relevance at all\nYou know they did not I don't know\nI mean it's so disturbing it's hard to imagine it just it just it's so disturbing but that is true they did not see the relevance not whatsoever so I mean the real danger that were\n... I Know the real proof is when people see this where can they see your work and and these example\nSure they got an army Horowitz dot com and the video was right there in the city\nAm I ... I mean it's great to have you on the program thanks for doing this because this is a great way to sample what do people know what do people believe at least in the case of this experiment how much are they willing to believe even when it's so fallacious that most of us would call it out immediately if we were asked a question\nAnd as safeguards against the government overreaching and doing things to citizens that the government should not be doing they didn't see that relevance at all\nNo they didn't know I don't know\nI mean it's so disturbing it's hard to imagine it just it just it's so disturbing but that is true they did not see the relevance that whatsoever so I mean the real danger that were\nI Know the real proof is when people see this where can they see your work and and these examples\nThat show they got on the dot com and it was right there in the city\nThat's am I ... I mean it's great to have you on the program things you're doing this because this is a great way to sample what do people know what do people believe at least in the case of this experiment how much are they willing to believe even when it's so full Asia's that most of us would call it out immediately\nI did and the thing that really bothered me was that he didn't answer the questions about well he didn't answer it hardly any questions but uh\nWhat can I tell you why that might be true and it might change your mind maybe if you go to if you go to any judge anywhere in America\nAnd you say judge I really hate drunk drivers one of them killed my mom so I have a reason personally to hate drunk drivers\nIf you get a drunk driver in front of him and you're going to be in front of you are you going to throw the book at him\nThat judge if he or she is responsible judge will say I am not going to tell you ahead of you know not recused\nThey're not going to prejudge a case so for instance if you ever saw a judge publically come out and say every time there's an issue of land rights which comes up in court frequently around America\nI'm always going to decide on behalf\nOf the landowner instead of the local government that may say they want to do something with a land if you say every time a case comes in front of me involving a worker who says he's been injured on the job I'm going to decide in favor of the worker\nThat judge should be off the bench and here's why and this is what judges have told me judges should never take a position that pre judge is a kind of case so for example when you have net which almost all of them in this case from the Democratic party who say your honor\nDo you take that roe versus Wade does establish law and you're not going to challenge it well the thing is that is a pre judging your case that may come before the court if you say your honor a if a if a man is suing the corporation you worked for will you side with the worker or the corporation\nHe should immediately refused and say I want to answer that\nBecause the minute you prejudged case you're not a good judge\nIf you say every time a case comes in front of me involving a worker who says he's been injured on the job I'm going to decide in favor of the worker\nThat judge should be off the bench and here's why and this is what judges have told me judges should never take a position that pre judge is a kind of case so for example when you have net which almost all of them in this case from the Democratic party who say your honor\nDo you take that roe versus Wade is establish law and you're not going to challenge it well the thing is that is a pre judging your case that may come before the court if you say your honor a if a if a man is suing the corporation you worked for will you side with the worker or the corporation\nHe should immediately refused and say I want to answer that\nBecause the minute you prejudged case you're not a good judge anymore now almost all the things that the Democrats asked judge Kavanaugh about what questions like that\nSaying tell us promises that you won't overturn roe v way and they didn't send those turns but they were trying to get him to take positions on things that almost guaranteed will come before the Supreme Court at some point in the next thirty or forty years\nAnd they wanted him to announce a head of time\nThat he would take a position on cases that he hasn't even heard yet now we don't want judges like that and I just explained why does that explain why he\nHad to give non answers to most of those questions because no judge should take a position on a case ahead of time not even your local judges in your town or county should take a position ahead of time now does that make sense to\nInvest your your master debater but uh I have been a master ... yes I bet you are but a ... that the question is why are all those people opposed and\nWhy why there's one word in one sacred word answers your question the word is abortion\nLost it slowly uh during that that ah that session giving his testimony and so that that is why people say he does not have a ...\nWell hold on and uh even David pay somebody ... accused you of trying to rape a woman if somebody falsely accused you of that would you have the kind of mild tone of voice that you have with me right now when you got dragged up\nIn front of national television cameras and told prove to us that you didn't try to rape that girl thirty six years ago so you've got an accusation that if\nPeople take it seriously and decide that you did this a third of a century ago your\nCareer goes away you're spot on the Supreme Court goes away your job is an appeals court judge go goes way and likely your entire law practice goes away you will never be employed as a lawyer you will never be employed as a judge\nIf you are facing that kind of threat based on a false accusation what would your response me would you be angry\nI Would I Would certainly be against it yes but uh how come how Harvard you're what you're talking about is not a re invited him that the teachers\nNot the ... and now you've got something wrong and I'm going to correct you on it\nJudge Kavanaugh three days ago sent a letter to Harvard He usually goes there and teaches constitutional law every year and he informed them I Am not going to be available to teach constitutional law\nHe's going to be on the Supreme Court he doesn't have time to go teach college class at this point most of them do not I don't know of a single one of the justices that teachers even at the local D.C colleges or universities how in the world with a guy who's sitting\nIf you are facing that kind of threat based on a fault accusation what would your response be would you be angry\nI was I Would certainly be against it yes but how come all how Harvard you're what you're talking about is not a re invited him back to teach us\nAbout not the case I Know you've got something wrong and I'm going to correct you on it\nJudge Kavanaugh three days ago sent a letter to Harvard He usually goes there and teaches constitutional law every year and he informed them I Am not going to be available to teach constitutional law\nHe's going to be on the Supreme Court he doesn't have time to go teach college class at this point most of them do not I don't know of a single one of the justices that teachers even at the local D.C colleges or universities how in the world with a guy who's sitting on the U.S Supreme Court have the time\nTo go all the way up up to uh up to Harvard and teach a constitutional law cause he wasn't just invited he sent them the letter now I'm Glad I get a chance to straighten\nThings out a letter he sent them the ladder\nAnd all you know there were people at Harvard who said we don't want him here now if you think that influenced his choice it may have\nBut he's the one who decided I'm not working there\nAnd he won't have the time because after tomorrow about twenty four hours from now judge Kavanaugh will be associate justice Brett Kavanaugh of the United States Supreme court back in just a moment you got the Lars Larson show

com\nWell given all the choices that us politicians have to make and we trust of the new make good ones should they be required to take cognitive and psychological chats and I love the idea I'm not sure how practical it is or whether it's constitutional but\nDr Henry Miller talked about wrote about it and he's a senior fellow at the Pacific research Institute and frankly a great asset to the show in a great friend of the show Dr Miller welcome back on\nThank you all are great to be with you\nSo what do you think about the idea of requiring that elected officials and I'd take it from Capitol Hill out to every state legislature and maybe every city council and county commission is this practical\nWell should be clear I Am not suggesting that in the article that it'd be required I'm suggesting that politicians subject to its all entirely and that the vote if they don't if they don't do it the voters punish them at the ballot box\nThat's a great free market approach to it is\nI think so so in the same way that we are like two or insist on knowing whether open heart surgery was successful in a prominent politician or brain surgery more to the point\nUm we we could do it for for just general intelligence and mental status and psychopathology testing and so on\nI I think uh I think it has merit\nSo darn do you think that there are are there some tests out there for which we have enough of a you know sort of a baseline to know that the tests are reliable that they don't create false\nPositives either of falsely tell us that somebody has a genius or false they tell us that somebody's a little on the crazy side where you might be able to say well if you take one of these it'll just help reassure the voters that you're doing All right and nobody has to be uh\nAnd I I think so so in the same way that we had like two or insist on a knowing whether open heart surgery was successful in a prominent politician or brain surgery more to the point\nUm we we could do it for for just general or intelligence and mental status and psychopathology testing and so on I\nI think uh I think it has merit\nTo ... do you think that there are are there some tests out there for which we have enough of a you know sort of a baseline to know that the tests are reliable that they don't create false\nPositives either a ... tell us that somebody is a genius or falsely tell us that somebody is a little on the crazy side where you might be able to say well if you take one of these it'll just help reassure the voters that you're doing All right and nobody has to be afraid it's going to produce a result there's going to paint them as a lunatic\nYeah there there actually are some good ones and ah you know some of it as clearly subjective so when a psychiatrist or tries to measure or evaluate your fund of knowledge and your incite a and your intelligence and your memory\nThat's that's all pretty subjective\nBut psychologist had come have come up over the years with tests like the MPR the Minnesota multi phase a personality into tore a that consists in its usual form of five hundred and sixty seven questions and that comes up with pretty good measures\nOf ten a clinical parameters are like hyper hypo can dry SSN psycho pathology and belligerence and and so on as well as for\nA scales that are that tend to\nShed light on the fluidity of the other test so if you try to give them the answers you want normal answers normal people answers thought that it can detect it because it asks questions in several different ways and a kind of looks for inconsistencies so I think\nI think there are pretty good ways to do that when the ... the tests are performed by professionals\nI use I took that one time or a couple of three decades ago 'cause I Know it'd be interesting I kept hearing about the M M beyond that I don't take it his\nPhone some very strange questions and you're right there is some hidden ways to test whether somebody is telling the truth or not or just trying to gain the result but you put forward the example of\nPete Domenici first uh end of the idea that he came out and told the public look I've I've got this uh did degenerative disease or at the wasting away the funneling temporal lobes\nAnd he was nice to be honest with the public about what was going on\nBut it tests like that might have really reassured people or perhaps suggested to the member of Congress or senator or that they are they really don't have any business doing the job anymore\n[laughter] [noise] yeah I think that's an excellent example and you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that\nA Senator McCain recently passed away from a brain cancer and\nA arguably he really should have resigned a retired when ... the severity of that was discovered and think about where we would have been today with the cap and all that kind of confirmation if he had been in in his uh sick bat\nIn Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote that's a practical example of debilitating ...\nUh that really arguably should have dictated resignation\nAnd by the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not\nExcellent example and you know another very topical one is uh of course we we all know that\nA Senator McCain recently passed away from a brain cancer and\nA arguably he really should have resigned a retired when the severity of that was discovered and think about where we would have been today with a cap and all that kind of confirmation if he had been in in his uh sick bat\nIn Arizona too ill to go to Washington to vote that's a practical example of debilitating\nUh that really arguably should have dictated a resignation\nAnd by the way a doctor I through this idea out awhile ago because we did have that question of whether or not something will be approved could hang on when the vote is taken in whether somebody's in town or out of town and that sort of thing I suggested that in this day and age when you can buy a house in signed the mortgage documents and\nYou know signed them electronically or send them you know over wire scanned them and then send them back\nThat are members of Congress should have the ability of voting electronically funny enough in their own chambers they do vote electronically but you have to be physically present in the Senate or physically present in the house to push the button or would it make sense if say you know that there's a senator from um a Montana\nOr deans who is going to beat his daughter's wedding tomorrow so he has to vote before he goes or go to the wedding and then quickly fly back to D.C\nTo cast a ballot should we at some point consider maybe the idea of allowing the senators to vote remotely might allow him to spend a lot more time in their district or their constituents and a lot more time away from the lobbyists of Capitol Hill\nAbsolutely laws makes perfect sense and uh there are ways to definitively verify that it is that person voting and you could do it in a book by something like Skype so that you see\nA a the counter could actually see that the person was cast as well you know is a little\nYou know it's funny doctor I don't know if you were Henry and I've been friends for a long time but uh I Know that there was a case I Know about recently a ... among some friends or acquaintances where somebody had to be on a regular a breathalyzer check and I said how do they make sure that it's actually this woman who's taking the breathalyzer\nAnd they said well they have a device attached to your smartphone\nAnd you have to actually look at the camera\nAnd be verified as being the person who's actually blowing into the tube showing your your blood alcohol content if they're doing multiple tests you know per week to assure that you've not gone back to the bottle and I thought well heck if you did that kind of thing with senators senator ... smartphone\nA show his retinas to the camera phone my my phone will do that it'll confirm who you are by right now it will confirm who you are by fingerprint\nYou could do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast their vote and then the senators could vote from anywhere and they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\nAbsolutely technology can do that with a with the great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other thing you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not that she doesn't seem to be affected all the time but\nThere have been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs or words can find a word and that is\nIt'll confirming who you are by fingerprint you could do two or three levels and say we know absolutely that's the person who press the button and cast the boat and then the senators could vote from anywhere and they wouldn't have to you know make sure they're on Capitol Hill to actually cast the votes we want them to be involved in\nAbsolutely technology can do that with a with the great fidelity these days you're absolutely right\nNow the other than you brought up is you think there might be a reason that Nancy Pelosi needs a test\nYeah in the article a I had links to a couple of videos of her speaking and she's not as she doesn't seem to be affected all the time but\nThere have been a few instances over the past year or so where she slurs or words can find a word and ah is what I Would consider way outside the bounds of normal\nUh ability to express herself so um\nWe're we're going to have to watch that wouldn't surprise me if and when she was deposed as a majority leader as a leader of the Dems and the house that she decides to retire I don't think she's well\nNow wants to have her on the court and it'll bring out the anti papers the laugh\nI'm so that sounds great but on the other hand I kind of think Trump should appoint a man I don't know what man but some man because we've seen ... now any man they nominate we the Republican nomination as we were going to be accused of rape on you're never going to drag out a bunch of lunatics do\nBring out and Julie sweating again and\nI ... yeah okay um they're evil and often do what they don't mind working evil they do mind looking implausible\nBy the way you should know that in cold results when the attorney in a very climbing above the law degrees clerked for important people or Justice Thomas in all let me ask you a legal question I don't do that very often but you see in the wall Street Journal report I imagine that says that Leland Kaiser the longtime friend of\nOf a Christian Ford says that she was leaned on by people she told the FBI the Jews leaned on to treat her story from\nI wasn't there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it through apparently to a story that said she was going to back up Christine Ford which would be I think it's good it's possible more than a one eighty or

people she told the FBI the Jews leaned on to train true story from\nI wasn't there I don't know Brett Kavanaugh I don't know anything about it you apparently to a story that said she was going to back up Christine Ford which would be I think if if it's possible more than one eighty\nOr from I don't know anything to I remember the incident use is not a criminal act to you know to to go out and try to inform somebody to lie to the FBI enhance to Congress in the process is like this where is that just something that's just terribly wrong but doesn't actually break any laws\nI mean I I haven't looked up to the federal deficit on that but it is certainly a crime to uh try to get someone to perjure themselves and quite closely related to\nTwo versions of it was on ... I I signed on assigned oath statement yeah absolutely and the crime if it was just in talking to Senate\nDemocrats and not saying it under oath\nUm possibly could day I'm speaking to a government official the FBI agents\nBut yeah it absolutely they should and they've got a problem here I Am so sick of Republicans and this is one of the wonderful things they've gone out of trunk he's showing it showing a public in the south but it is to attack back for one for Republicans always want to be the good in sports and oh okay\nWe want in the end we got we got cabin on the court no no no no no a statement has to be made this\nWill never happen again you will not for me or someone like this and will destroy his life like that\nI couldn't agree more an out no one should we use said don't trot out somebody else but let's say\nThat ah Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court in the next two years before\nThe end of this term and I anticipate a second term because of everything that's going on here from what can we do proactively to shame the Democrats I Know they have no shame but what can we do to shame them to say don't try this again because private can't\nProsecute privately profit\nI Want to know who the letter on that was given and confidence to two and then we're not at all Feinstein thing we have to get a lot of that they know the name of the guy who was instantly producing the home addresses and phone numbers of Republican senators on and said that liberals couldn't couldn't on and off for\nThem and that's what's known as doc thing on and and we do have some perjury charges including for I Know they love playing a judge Kavanaugh oh it's perjury perjury he he didn't say\nHe say he rank excessively no I I I think he kind of didn't say there are no more than that\nI mean it's either fall or or silliness what they are claiming is is perjury we while Christine lazy afford not to be confused with Dr for number one she's not a medical doctor number two and she's not even a psychologist\nShe lied about four things she lied about her fear of flying up um she lied about the polygraph\nTest she lied about needing ... to a second front door I'm actually lied about being a psychologist statements under oh\nDo you think that the Republicans have the guts to prosecute her for that because this I mean here's a here's my rule for that and now I'm not on the non lawyer I think if if you lie under oath\nI think the technical you know the the ... punishment is lying under oath is perjury and in many cases they don't go after it because it's not ... it may be important but it's not consequential this was hugely consequential this could have literally changed American history for the next decade\nTherefore no one she's not a medical doctor number two is she's not even a psychologist she lied about four things she lied about her fear of flying up um she lied about the polygraph\nTest she lied about needing ... eight to eight seconds front door I'm actually lied about being a psychologist statements under oh\nDo you think that the Republicans have the guts to prosecute her for that because this I mean here's a here's my rule for that and I'm not on the non lawyer I think if if you lie under oath I think the technical you know the the ... punishment is lying under oath is perjury\nAnd in many cases they don't go after it because it's not ... it may be important but it's not consequential this was hugely consequential this could have literally changed American history for the next few decades so with such a consequential\nResult lying under oath in this case should absolutely be be prosecuted to the phones degrees along\nYeah also we saw a crop and Democrats about\n'em because they are just go in the country of three hundred and twenty five

weaken policing the criminals subtly proliferated\nCouldn't buy firearms\nPeople were not allowed to have firearms\nWhat else happened\nI can give you some more examples and then there was a backlash\nThe backlash to this liberalism\nRight now for example it's a direct parallel to the wind or Republican Germany and you have groups like on the ... the Berman cowards you put on black masks beat people up kicking girls in the street\nAttacking police breaking windows most of them are punks who go back to college teaching jobs or God Knows where they are\nWith impunity well we had the same thing that the world has seen the same thing in Germany and the into war period with a communist exactly the same thing you don't know that the brown shirts of Hitler World War a reaction to the lawlessness of the\nCommunist I don't think you understood this most people have it backwards now don't don't trust what I'm saying and Sam glorifying the brown shirts I Am simply giving you a piece of history and lessons for mystery remember when I set the human eight times those that do not know history are condemned to repeat it I Am telling you it's showing\nWhat do you think I killed myself riding mass hysteria for\nBecause I'm trying to send out a warning to the world where this will lead\nAnd I see where this really\nSo just like on the far today and the Occupy movements if today which are lawless and violent the kiss of today\nHad gone by Nancy Pelosi says world us raptors same thing there so the communists weren't given the green light\nTo attack anyone they wanted as they're attacking the Republicans now senators no one stops them if there's nowhere powers to ... to protect ourselves from these ...\nSo the Germans said enough is enough for what happened was a lot of ex military from World war one along with tremendous money from the aristocracy that we're still in Germany they had secret cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units coal brown shirts\nAnd they started beating a communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen there don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you're gonna be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you the story\nBiggest as this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will by Scott mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc\nAnd the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they shared the brown shirts at first this is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you\nThe average person cheered on the ground churches are more men joined them\nStory is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford it will buy stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc\nAnd the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they shared the brown shirts at first this is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you\nThe average person cheered on the brown stretches so more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies\nAnd opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows with it the right wing\nSo that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong costs to laugh with like you to think he said listen the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his delusions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass those liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench\nThey may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point in my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut it's a little ... and not yet that extreme\nThe left which say any of us illusions of extreme to the left said that Kavanaugh was a drunk which he wasn't a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't and he drank too much beyond what college student and you know and you didn't\nWhat did they do in college what uh Jerry Nadler do in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat he's doing he drank about a sham it's drank too much about the shepherd says well what are you know what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy and went to college I didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an aberration\nWhat I'm saying to us history is a very good\nIndicator of what's coming\nThings go around and cycles\nSo when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the less than a super liberalism is a good thing for this country and the west\nYou're a hundred percent wrong\nYou're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that\nShe this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nThings will happen that you can't believe\nAre happening and what happens so fast you'll say it's not happening\nAnd liberalism will be there is the reason for it\nYou say it can happen here\nWell it will happen here\nAnd the economic downturn that as being predicted by some economists is a is inevitable it's going to happen that I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever because we're in a heightened now up in the stock market\nThe inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nOpposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that\nShe this is what triggers at all\nIf we have an economic blowout\nA a right wing leader will arise that will make Trump look like what he is which is a liberal or centrist\nThings will happen that you can't believe\nAre happening and what happens so fast you'll say it's not happening\nAnd liberalism will be there is the reason for it\nYou say it can happen here\nWell it will happen here\nAnd the economic downturn that as being predicted by some economists is a is inevitable it's going to happen that I'm afraid if it happens it will be worse than ever because we're in a heightened now up in the stock market\nThe inflation is out of control incidentally right underneath the surface they're printing money right now\nIn a way I've never seen it done in this country in the country's history\nThey're just printing money\nAnd under the Democrats when we criticize\nDeficit spending we were right because I'm a fiscal conservative but all fiscal conservatives have dummy up they shut their mouths you put on your anyone in the radio\nTalking about the run away and the the excuse me the uh\nNo not one person\nThey all want to go in there and get the or the treatment\nThey all want to get a tour of the older\nBut someone's gotta say stop printing the money this is crazy\nBecause someone's gonna have to pay for that\nJust doesn't go on forever\nYou want to wind up taking a wheelbarrow of cash or credit cards to buy a loaf of bread as\nHappened in why mark Germany at the end just before all of this that or take a whole wheelbarrow full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread that's how valueless the money I become now several years ago I wrote a book called trickle down tyranny you'll still find it on Amazon but I Will bet that the company\nHas not remove the personal attack reviews on that book and all my other books the way they did by cutting nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book what happened\nYes that's right not enough you find stop mass hysteria next week up there what you will\nYou'll find all the negative reviews left stuck there\nSome of them posted by the enemies of America as some of them posted by enemies or Michael Savage a but none of them will be taken down the way nine hundred negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's book or removed and this practice demonstrates exactly how that concept works\nSo if you think that things are great now good for you and I hope they stay forever but nothing stays forever if history teachers anything there are cycles to account I mean there are cycles to a political views\nAnd I pray that as I write on page three oh three\nThat is where when and how the carcass of the one strike United States will become nothing more than ... for the masses as China and India rise we'll sink even deeper\nAnd we may well

our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hottest I'm of the day between three and ... and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\n... there's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and you have you're walking them on that too right in them and and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us how much power we can afford to use and went to you\nAnd now our new I mean if he has our new um [noise] on peak power the really expensive power is between three and eight PM it is the hardest time of the day between three and ... and I am the reason I'm so passionate about this\nIs because I understand what the power companies and the monopoly are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it so the smart energy management the way to the analogy of the people like like that I've been told\nIs remember when we have landlines and the telephone companies said if you use your landline to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay a better rate\nWith our telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would beat they were making money hand over fist met her when we called me long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees out there for home and we were and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added on to our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars in forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it's the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill all walk on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you and I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up and now I've locked in\nThat no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half and eight and a half cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you any more so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that chose to call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying towards the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your home care on that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this there's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus the electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um\n... it just it doesn't make sense for them they can you give me a raise everybody should just call you just find out how to read\nTheir bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time\nIt's site ... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down\nIt's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so there's been people that have listened to us\nThat have been hearing us for a year year and a half and then today they're out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click on a time and then they go oh now I understand what she rains and so no judgments but at the end of the day\nWe all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty well\nYou're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS\nHearing a four year year and a half and half native out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go home now I understand what she runs\nAnd so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon and gas over here is to fifty well\nYou're going to go over here in Haiti fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece reports today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid to the power company\nCut that in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give recall she does a free consultation she's ready to what the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is asked solar Sandy dot com go to ... make sure ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on a mission when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life 'cause I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful\nThan she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand that my daughter was able to help them understand it\nSo now it's about I'm there to educate\nAnd give people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe they just haven't got the information yet but let's get you with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power cause\nShe valley white it's a no obligation free consultation to you out there she had lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone the number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... ... feet it's ask felt solar Sandy dot com [noise]\n\nHigh solar Sandy haired and currently you're buying power from your company's paying\nThese taxes and all kinds of charges electricity I Want you to save money on bill you're already spending too much and it's going to keep going on to get said it was over at my work sheet and then I come here how come you have any time you mean and how much the Y.

health care economy fencing good science intersect always real tall he's unscripted America hopes melody\nAnd before the break Rick and I were talking about well we we started introducing liver health to you and and itchy surrounding liver that's main topic of the show but then it kind of lead to find the the topic of vitamin C. and I was telling Rick\nOver to break that I just recently saw a picture of what vitamin C. looks like under a microscope and it's really beautiful it actually looks like\nBroken I broken uh what what do you call it the class stained glass oh CNN laughter guy or a try yeah it's broken fingers but it's actually really beautiful that Rick I Know that you had just a little bit more information on that too that you wanted to touch on yeah\nThe the vitamin C. and so it's such a great\nNutrient and like the line and find it so much research in vitamin C a great but one of the things that a\nDoctor medical doctor they used to work with me or names and email and she actually said they've done some microscope research on white salt and she said they did in vitro study on white salt whereas in a test tube or something and white cells are normally very active\nAnd they introduced sugar into the white cells and white cells they all just sort of clump together they weren't very active answer sugar had a direct effect on the white cells which supports Loma Linda study that was mentioning\nSo it just really interesting vitamin C. valuable nutrient for to keep your body optimally ready to fight infection\nSo you can think of it like a metabolic broom that sort of got used to say you know just keeping yourself cleaned out it's a really a neat substance and\nHe's kind of like putting on armored here in a way they are yeah I didn't care you're arming your

tumor products out there and there's a lot of confusion and they're honestly there's a lot of misinformation and it's really sad what goes on but\n[noise] the company we get the river from it is an Italian company they are doing in my opinion the best work uh we use Murray by because Dr ... read the research on it Dr singer is obviously very well informed\nThey I feel that they're making the best product out there and you know everybody wants to say that but I really think based on the research\nThat's done this is the best product there's another product out there called beats the I'm Ninety five which is very popular and I'm not saying that's the Sara Lee is a bad product but they're putting out a lot of information memory by that breed they're putting drawing or even to question\nAnd I think that's I I think it's wrong and so anyway so I Wonder if we're just read some stuff\nThat some are just kind of a comparison that was done here so you have some understanding and this is what was written by the company that poses Murray about\nAnd they are questioning they say in the ... study which is an Italian study a twenty nine fold increase was not adjusted to accommodate for the fact that less than one fifth of the curriculum and find it so it's actually a Crick human and that is true steak because Kirk human has to be bonded to a fossil lip it and so so it it has electric humanoid\nBut it's extremely effective so indeed the company where we get them from their response is the twenty nine fold increase absorbed in the first to a Mohler comparison that the chemical term the same amount of non formulated Kirk human versus formulated curriculum and in terms of uh weight to wake comparison\nSame weight of non formulated Crick human and formulated Kirk human one has approximately to divide this value by five cents only twenty percent of ... is Kirk human absolutely\nSo precise comparison can only be done in terms of Mohler comparison and this is a kind of science it honestly I'm not a chemist by training the Italians they do their work the Europeans I mean most understand the Europeans are really doing top notch work\nWhen it comes to botanical substances so you can only do this comparison in terms of Mohler but the beat Jim company became the company's not bringing that to life since the absorption is not linear\nThe need to make more comparison is a very basic concept in all a farmer coke kinetic studies ... kinetic would be you know farmers\nCognitive your pharmacology and you know it's basically talking about you know different chemical details regarding botanical so no comparison with other formulation is currently possible based on the technically flawed and only ... kinetic study done on BBC um Ninety five so you know that's one issue\nAnd then one other thing they ride as I'm concerned about Kirk human products focusing on a single member of the curriculum and family within their curriculum and family\nThere are there different Kirk humanoid and so you know I'm concerned about this is what they write will Murray but guess what contains all three Kirk humanoid and their absorption is magnified with finding some formulation so that's that's disingenuous so it's\nNeed to make more comparison is a very basic concept in all a form of coke kinetic studies from a cocaine addict could be you know farmers\nA cognitive your pharmacology and you know it's basically talking about you know different chemical details regarding botanical so no comparison with other formulation is currently possible based on the

all three Kirk humanoid an Arab served as magnified with finding some formulation so that's that's disingenuous\nSo it just deport consumer there's so much confusion out there it's just really sad\nAnd then there's one study that uh\nThat they did beat the I'm Ninety five did and they talk about three Kirk human in the bloodstream that was measured well trick human rights and not even can't even be found in the bloodstream as free Crick human because you're Kim and its conjugate it through the small intestine and has to be down to a fossil lip and so you don't even find it\nIn the

to health care and lower income areas as well implementing healthy lifestyle choices and reducing cancer risk factors in order to make the biggest impact possible on reducing the number of cancer related deaths\nWe discuss had immediate challenges as well as how to educate the public on preventing and reducing risks of cancer in our daily lives let's listen [noise]\n\nDr Brawley from what I understand that your outlook on medicine and health care has been shaped by your experience growing up in Detroit can you tell us a little bit about that\nYeah I grew up in the inner city of Detroit and ah I was a neighborhood where there were a lot of people a lot of the adults who never even thought about going to high school not to mention college\nA lot of blue collar workers work the factories are in the auto industry this is back in the Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies and uh\n[noise] uh I was a smart kid and a lotta people supported me a through grade school junior high school and high school and even into college because I was a smart kid who was trying to do something [noise]\nUh and uh I learned a lot from those people they were not highly formally educated but they weren't very wise\nOne of the things I learned was if your medicine or they were very frightful were concerned\nThat doctors didn't care about them they were very concerned that doctors didn't do what they were doing they actually talked a lot about being experimented on but what they actually met with the doctor didn't know if this treatment would work so they would try this and they would try that wasn't\nThey were concerned about formal experimentation\nAnd then when I got in medical school\nAnd started practicing medicine afterwards I realized that a lot of those concerns were\nSchool and high school and even into college because I was a smart kid who was trying to do something [noise]\nUh and uh I learned a whole lot from those people they were not highly formally educated but they weren't very wise [noise]\nOne of the things I learned was their fear of Madison or they were very frightful were concerned\nThat doctors didn't care about them they were very concerned that doctors didn't know what they were doing they actually talked a lot about being experimented on but what they actually met with the doctor didn't know if this treatment would work so they would try this and they would try that wasn't\nThey were concerned about formal experimentation and then when I got in medical\nSchool and started practicing medicine afterwards I realize that a lot of those concerns were actually incredibly appropriate uh I learned that there were a lot of doctors and a lot of hospitals and health care systems that were very into making money there are a lot of\nAlso very important uh in terms of uh the American Cancer Society are educating patient it's really an educated consumer that it's the it's an educated consumer\nThey get a good quality care\nOr you want people to understand the disease you want people ask questions to engage the doctors you know even if you have the best doctor if you are asking questions engage in the conversation\nAnd engaged in what you're getting your going to get the best out of that doctor even if that doctor goes into the room trying to give you his or her best you're going to get hit by being engaged so we want to educate patients\nA lot of problems in health care or actually access to health care getting a ride to the doctor or getting a ride to radiation therapy everyday Monday through friday for six weeks hard problem for a lot of clubs so the ACS is trying to provide services helping people get transportation [noise]\nWe have hope lodges a number of major cities where people can actually come and stay near the hospital when they're getting their treatment\nA these are like Ronald McDonald says but for adults and in some areas adults and children\nAre then we want to provide things like screening guidelines ah we want our guidelines for screening the science space you know some screening can actually be quite harmful in some screening can be very helpful when you want to make sure that people do look very hopeful stuff\nBumps in health care or actually access to health care getting a ride to the doctor or getting a ride the radiation therapy everyday Monday through friday for six weeks\nHard problem for a lot of folks so the ACS is trying to provide services helping people get transportation [noise] we have hope lodges a number of major cities where people can actually come and stay near the hospital when they're getting their treatment\nOf these shows are like Ronald McDonald says but for adults and in some areas adults and children\nAre then we want to provide things like screening guidelines ah we want our guidelines for screening these science space you know some screening can actually be quite harmful in some screening can be very helpful when he won and make sure that people do look very hopeful stuff\nAnd then there are a lot of things in terms of laws in the United states it can be helpful to the cancer patient or or the patient who we hope will never be a cancer patient\nYou know forty percent of Americans do not live in communities have smoke free legislation\nI Want to try to prevent every kid from being exposed to second hand smoke every adult from being exposed to second hand smoke or perhaps the greatest work the American Cancer Society has done and it's more than one hundred your history is in his work on tobacco control and smoking cessation\nAnd we are a part of the reason why a fifty five percent of American men smoked in Nineteen fifty five and now it's down to about sixteen Seventeen percent\nUh smoking for women want from thirty five percent of adults in Nineteen sixty five and now it's down to about Fifteen Percent those declines are something that the ACS can be very proud of and claim that we are a part of the reason why those declines happened\nSo when you look at that um and you look it's a very ... kind of a tool and smoking vaping I think that it's going to be concerned here\nWe are very concerned about the being ah they didn't uh may have other health problems beyond cancer\nA mini people argue that vaping of nicotine can be useful in getting people off of tobacco and that is true I I Would prefer the smoker use one of the seven FDA approved nicotine ah\nAh devices are nicotine or a way of nicotine drops with nicotine lozenges nicotine gum nicotine patches\nThey're seven different uh instruments that can be used that are hefty approve\nThat's what I Would hope someone would use to get off of tobacco along with support from their family support from doctors maybe even some psychological support [noise]\nAh some people prefer to use a vaping a or e cigarettes [noise]\nAh my hope is that those people would be on e cigarettes for the shortest possible time if they go that route I cannot\nUh over expressed the fact that ah we don't know the science of e cigarettes yet in ... inhaling ... I call\n'em may not be the best thing for the lungs we may eventually twenty Thirty years from now see a lot of people with popcorn long pulmonary fibrosis and other diseases do the e cigarettes so I'm I'm not a big fan of cigarettes no I can imagine\nWe used to get off of tobacco along with support from their family support from doctors maybe even some psychological support [noise] ah some people prefer to use vaping a or e cigarettes [noise]\nAh my hope is that those people would be on e cigarettes for the shortest possible time if they go that route I cannot\nUh over expressed the fact that ah we don't know the science of e cigarettes yet in ... inhaling ... I call\n'em may not be the best thing for the lungs we may eventually twenty Thirty years from now see a lot of people with popcorn long pulmonary fibrosis and other diseases do the e cigarettes so I'm I'm not a big fan of cigarettes\nNo I can imagine a lot of that um education in a lot of that actually which brings back also to um the signing of the national cancer actually Nineteen Seventy one I'm often referred to us to war on cancer\nAnd how we import and watch that stuff in American history in terms of of cancer fighting cancer\nUh when we look at what has happened in cancer over the last really fifty to sixty years [noise]\nAh there are two things that are really important the surgeon general's announcement in Nineteen sixty four that tobacco causes lung cancer and that led to other work that showed that cause now Eighteen cancers and signing of the national cancer act in December of Nineteen Seventy one\nNow that was legislation that was put forth by a number of congressman and both the Republican and democratic side\nA Ted Kennedy refer to it as Richard Nixon declaring war on cancer Richard Nixon never use the war analogy\nBut what it did was it put a lot of money into basic research it created a cancer control program so we actually knew and which direction the numbers are going to actually created a cancer centers program the NCAA designate cancer centers program\nAnd it really galvanized the country in trying to do something in cancer including the clinical trials program that has given us a number of different wonderful treatment a number of different wonderful drugs [noise]\nUh the basic science funding has really paid off because our definition of cancer today is very different from my definition of cancer even Twenty years ago no from Eighteen fifty until really\nTwo thousand we had a definition of cancer it was just really driven by the biopsy German pathologists invented the technology during the biopsy you look at something under the microscope this cancer\nTo day we're looking at both the biopsy as well as ... what genes are turned on what genes are turned off what genes are mutate\nAnd awareness is letters to is uh when I graduated from medical school in Nineteen eighty five where two kinds of can't a lung cancer non small cell lung cancer in small cell lung cancer I still don't know why we call it non small cell lung cancer\nOr but today because of ... there are multiple types of non small cell lung cancer\nAnd it's odd determines what kinds of drugs we used to treat it certain drugs are more appropriate than other drugs uh and the prognosis of all of those different kinds of lung cancer are all\nBiopsy you look at something under the microscope this cancer\nTo day we're looking at both the biopsy as well as Don makes what genes are turned on what genes are turned off what genes are mutate\nAnd awareness is letters to is uh when I graduated from medical school in Nineteen eighty five with two kinds of can't a lung cancer non small cell lung cancer in small cell lung cancer I still don't know why we call it non small cell lung cancer\nOr but today because of genomics there are multiple types of non small cell lung cancer\nAnd it's odd determines what kinds of drugs we used to treat it certain drugs are more appropriate than other drugs\nUh and the prognosis evolved with those different kinds of lung cancer are all very different as well so our understanding what cancer is has fundamentally changed because of that National Cancer act in that investment in basic research\nSo major step in the very important what role does the American Cancer Society play in the interplay between the national cancer acts National Cancer Institute or other organizations in in helping\nHer well in the Nineteen fifties the American Cancer Society was the largest funder of cancer research in the United states we funded more cancer research than the national Cancer Institute\nAh with the national cancer act which was push by the American Cancer Society and our matriarch Mary last year she transformed the American Cancer Society in the Nineteen forties and fifties\nAnd in Nineteen fifties and sixties really campaign for a national can track that was finally signed in Nineteen Seventy one [noise]\nUh the national Cancer Institute is now the largest funder of cancer research ah you know wild over five billion dollars a year now or the American Cancer Society as a smaller fond of cancer research a hundred and twenty five two hundred and fifty million dollars a year\nAnd we try to focus that a research in areas that the large governmental National Cancer Institute is on able to focus it for example\nIn the Nineteen nineties or the government a stop to setting aside money for young investigators and only funded these large grant that were view really geared toward the mid career person has been doing this for Fifteen Twenty years\nWe set aside money for young investigators\nNow let's take another break and after break ruled back with a somewhat questions [noise]\n\n\nSo if you if you look at those differences in in regions in America if you look at or maybe the availability of of money availability off off I'm a ... or ... or government incentives\n... what are some of the things that you really can learn ... points I mean how can you help or you know just\nBy well already with the Affordable CARE Act and some states electing to expand Medicaid so that everybody has coverage of some sort [noise]\nUh and other states electing not to expand Medicaid we are developing new state by state disparities\nYou know it is very clear that uh the colorectal cancer rate and in Arkansas death rate in Arkansas is going down because they actually expanded Medicare\nWhereas when you look at some surrounding states like Texas we don't see that happening because they chose not to expand Medicare and not to give all adults some form of health insurance\nUh we we see a a huge problem by the way in prevention and diet uh you've heard about food desert [noise]\nWe've got certain states where you know the federal government recommends that people eat five and nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day we have certain states where the average in terms of fruit and vegetable consumption is less than two servings per day\nWell so we're we're huge disparities in preventing that activities everybody wants to focus on treatment I Want to focus on the entire spectrum prevention all the way through survivorship\nYou refer to food deserts in America I'm tell us a little bit more about that\nYeah well first off I'm with the American Cancer Society have some wonderful epidemiologist\nAnd in trying to figure out what could be a we notice that high school educated or college educated I should say Americans have a much lower death rate from cancer than non college educated\nAh we asked the question if everybody in America and the risk of death from cancer of college educated Americans\nHe's in preventing that activities everybody wants to focus on treatment I Want to focus on the entire spectrum prevention all the way through survivorship\nYou refer to food deserts in America I'm a little bit more about that\nYeah well first off I'm and we're the American Cancer Society have some wonderful epidemiologist\nAnd in trying to figure out what could be a we noticed that high school educated or college educated I should say Americans have a much lower death rate from cancer than non college educated\nAh we asked the question if everybody in America and the risk of death from cancer of college educated Americans how many people would not die from cancer and the answer is we estimate six hundred and ten thousand Americans died from cancer this year\nBut if everybody had the death rate of college educated Americans\nLiberate the number would be a hundred and fifty thousand less that should be different twenty five percent of all cancer deaths we'd go away\nIf everybody had the prevention and all of the treatment and all of the things that college educated Americans have twenty five percent cancer deaths\nAre preventable man\nAnd even more preventable keep in mind of college educated Americans seven percent smoke six to seven percent smoke of college educated Americans their group that have\nObesity and lack of exercise as a problem we started looking at what is the big buys in terms of saving lives uh the first one uh is smoking\nA if there were no smoking we would easily prevent about a hundred and Seventy thousand deaths from cancer a year in the United states\nSmoking is a big by we waste a lot of money on cigarettes aren't back though we waste a lot of money treating tobacco related illness if we could just get rid of tobacco we would save a lot of money\nOf course we'd have to find something for the tobacco farmers in the tobacco industry people to do but we could find other jobs for those folks\nThe next big one in terms of cancer prevention uh about a hundred thousand lives a year or last because of a combination of obesity not enough exercise\nIn consuming too many calories it's a three legged stool a lot of people think about obesity it's obesity too many calories and not enough exercise\nUh energy balance is what the dieticians would want to say uh that's the second leading cause of cancer in ... and then we have other things like alcohol alcohol causes a four percent about cancer death so\nWe could actually prevent a lot of cancer deaths and these are relatively inexpensive buys a lunch counter balance that with screening I'm not against screening at all [noise]\nBut if we were to go to Ninety percent of all Americans being up to date on colorectal cancer screening ah we would prevent about thirty thousand deaths a year from color rectal cancer\nWe want to Ninety percent of all women being up to date on a breast cancer screening we were preventing about six to eight thousand deaths per year\nUm well let's take another quick break and then we'll be back a which some more questions\nUh that second leading cause of Kingston United States and we have other things like alcohol alcohol causes a four percent about cancer death\nSo we could actually prevent a lot of cancer deaths and these are relatively inexpensive buys a lunch counter balance that with screening I'm not against screening at all\nBut if we were to go to Ninety percent of all Americans being up to date on colorectal cancer screening or we will prevent about thirty thousand deaths a year from ... cancer\nWe want to Ninety percent of all women being up to date on a breast cancer screening we prevent about six to eight thousand deaths per year\nUm well let's take another quick break and then we'll be back in which some more questions about ah maybe put screening I mean because we were talking about screening a little bit uh but they're probably more seems book screening of diagnosable\n\nBrings already you're going to be made like\nReal estate investing in the Phoenix area it's a great way to start making money yes there's risk but also potential for higher

monopolies are doing to us\nThey are saying you want to use power during the hottest times a day oh boy it's going to cost you a lot of money and as I gave an example before people were keeping the thermostat eighty eighty to eighty four eighty five\nThere's no place to go except to the mall and and and leave your house and yet you're walking them on that to writing them all ... and it's not fair that the power company should dictate to us\nHow much power we can afford to use and when to use it\nSo the smart energy management the way that the analogy of the people like like that I've been told is remember when we had landlines and the telephone company said if you use your landline to call long distance\nMonday through friday you pay the higher rate if you wait some nights and weekends you'll pay it a better rate\nWith our telephone lines were no more expensive during the daytime Monday through friday than they were cheaper on nights and weekends they could just tell us what our rates would be they were making money hand over fist met her when we called him a long distance phone calls [noise]\nWise consumers waited two nights and weekends with our power it's ... it's it's it's exactly the same thing the power company knows that between three and eight PM the hardest time of the day when the hundred and Fifteen degrees up there for home and we and we come home at five o'clock\nAnd we've kept her thermostat high and we're wanting to cool it off a little bit and make dinner at that we're going to use a lot more electricity between five and eight PM so they made it like that\nAnd so they're not just charging for the ... kilowatts there is actually what's called a demand charge that added on to our bills that Thirteen point five for that Nineteen whatever or that that number [noise]\nTimes that by Seventeen dollars and forty four cents and it's an additional charge so if you're kilowatts are a hundred and eighty nine dollars\nUm it has the power that you consume at whatever the rate is\nAnd then that demand church Thirteen point five four times Seventeen dollars and forty percent that demand church is more than the cost of your kill off on that particular rape plan it is to me and I do get wound up about this and I get very upset about it is\n... ... it's criminal um I'd say that the power companies thank you and I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is\nWe know we have to pay for a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if a PS semester he want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nUpset about it is ... ... it's criminal\nUm I'd say that the power companies thank you and I say the power companies have a license steal from us on a monthly basis because a lot of us have it on auto pay the other ones of U.S Open the bill and we barely look at it but it's a bill that no matter how high it is we\nKnow we have to pay it so a lot of us don't understand it nobody understands their power bill now I come in and I show you you're producing your own at between seven and a half an eight cents per kilowatt\nYou're going to have a significant increase in the cost of your power locked in for the next twenty five thirty years if ... if you want to raise their rates once a week from now on once you've got producing your own power\nIt will not affect you anymore so you've just been a whites consumer like the consumer that shows the call Graham on nights and weekends you're saying I'm going to take control back over a bill that I'm already spending way too much money on it's gonna continue to go up\nAnd now I've locked in my own power rate for my own home increases the value of the house\nMost families are entitled to get their tax credit which is well over ten thousand dollars in a state tax credit for a thousand that's actually money in their pocket a lot of people don't understand that it's actually a refund to them\nAnd I explain all this to them so not only are you paying between seven and a half and eat and have since for your kilowatts on your roof\nYour tax credit just paying two words the cost of producing your own power you've just benefit you increase the value of your home you've locked in your heart rate for the next twenty five thirty years\nAnd you're living comfortably in your homes Carol and that's the two things I tell people\nThere is not just one reason to do this\nThere's two maybe even more than that but the two basic ones\nPut more of your hard earned money in your own pocket versus electric companies and live more comfortably and don't have to worry about the demand peak demand times an on demand and you know they're they're ever changing them and if people think that this is the last rate increase in the last\nComplications that the electric companies are going to throw at us\nSorely sorely mistaken people our bills are going to continue to grow up they are never going to stop where they're at um ... it just it doesn't make sense for them they built in Ukrainian rates everybody should just call you just\nFind out how to read their bill and then I don't know how to read they're real and then all of a sudden they're going to be like oh my God I Can't even believe that if he'll go why did I Do the sooner I write so many people will say that on my show all the time it's site\n... I Do a rate I'm review and break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that has been hearing us for a year year and a half\nAnd today they're out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to click all the time and then they go home now you understand what she rang and so no\nJudgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say it's simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car and gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here\nAnd break it down it's a lot of information Carol we've been doing this back and forth for almost two years now so you have heard me say these things over and over and over again and I say the multiple times but it took me a lot to learn all of this so\nThere's been people that have listened to us that have been hearing a four year year and a half an hour and ... out there but no sometimes it just takes some hearing the right thing for it to collect all the time\nAnd then they go oh now I understand what she writes and so no judgments but at the end of the day we all have an electric bill we will always have an electric bill and when I say is simple like this if you're going down the street and you need gas for your car\nAnd gas over here is five dollars a gallon gas over here is to fifty\nWell you're going to go over here and pay two fifty and that's essentially Carol\nI'm saving people over half\nOff their power costs over the next twenty five years and that an average home today under a PS Messer piece reports today's rates\nWhen you added up the average home we use between a hundred and a hundred and thirty dollars worth of power that they'll have paid the power company cut in half and put the breast in your pocket that's an awful lot of money well here's what we're\nGoing to do we want to give out your phone number because everyone really should just give her a call she does a free consultation she's ready to what the better Business Bureau I just found out at that out and uh her phone number direct it is six to three\nEight five zero eight two two nine she wants you to go up on her website it is ask solar Sandy dot com go to ask make sure it's ... dot com\nFill out the kilowatt worksheet and she can help you save money on a bill that you're already paying way too much money on what are your final words for today you know\nIt it's the simplest is you know I really am on a mission and when I helped my daughter it was the first time in a long time due to the my circumstances that I was able to do\nSomething really significant in her life because I financially wasn't able to help her but I saw the really big problem for her and it gave me\nA self accomplishment in it she was so ever so grateful\nThan she shared it with her neighbors and a lot of her neighbors did it because the than I was able to help them understand that my daughter was able to help them understand that so now it's about I'm there to educate\nAnd give people the the information so that they can make an informed decision about their own power costs they wouldn't let somebody else choose their host what kind of payment they could afford for mortgage they wouldn't let somebody ... ... how much they could afford for car why would people\nUntil maybe it's just they just haven't got the information yet but let's get you with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power\nCause she's valley white it's a no obligation free consultation to you out there she has lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone the number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two two nine go on that website and check out the ... the it's ask sell solar Sandy dot com\n[noise]\nHow much they could afford for car why would people and maybe they just haven't got the information yet but let's get you with the right information you can make an informed decision about your power 'cause\nShe's valley white it to no obligation free consultation to you out there she had lots of incentives to that she offers to everyone the number to call her direct it is area code six to three eight five zero eight two nine go on that website and check out the ... the it's ask sell solar Sandy dot com\n[noise]\nYou basically you don't have a choice that's your power company\nBut you have a choice now because producing your own power at about between seven and eight cents per kilowatt is a choice and you're going to put more of your hard earned money back in your own pocket in your ... your family's budget versus the power companies\nThe power companies you know I can say all kinds of things about the park and has the power companies are there to make money and make a profit and they're going to make a lot of profit this year\nExcept if I have anything to do with it so I brought into de ... from families households that I've helped in recent months and if you can see this Carol how much does this person oh\nMeg it is two hundred and eighty four dollars and fifty seven send because they they created Nineteen hundred and fifty dollars worth of their\nOwn power and they're going to get this isn't a PS customer of mine Michael ...\nWho is going to get a check for over one thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars at the end of this year\nSo you're not only producing your own power between seven and eight cents now a PS is buying that extra power back in your roof is potentially ... you're putting your roof to work and you're putting your that you're leaving no money on your roof 'cause that's what my thing\nSo I must say you have a few of them are I must say this you\nKnow if you've heard so much and we said this before\nThe thing about all of this is that there's different information all the time it's new and that's what's so we're standing all about she does all the research for everybody and then she comes and she talked to you it's a no obligation free consultation that you go to them if you give them a a two hundred dollar or whatever it is it's a two\nHundred and fifty dollar federal I ultimately settlers that aiding incentive to help people when you were installed this is to\nYou for for working with me ... I I work for my family's I'm there to do my best work for them [noise]\nUm I'm not a solar company I'm an energy expert and I actually to educate you about how your electric bills work and all these fees and charges and a gestures and people are really seeing these huge differences in their bills this year and they're going oh my gosh\nThere's different information all the time it's new and that's what's so we're standing all about she does all the research for everybody and then she comes and she talked to you it's a no obligation free consultation that you go to them if you give them a a two hundred dollar or whatever it is\nIt's a two hundred and fifty dollar federal I ultimately settlers that aiding incentive to help people when you're installed this is to thank you for for working with me\n... I I work for my family's I'm there to do my best work for them [noise]\nUm I'm not a solar company I'm an energy expert and I actually will educate you about how your electric bills work and all these fees and charges and a gestures and people are really seeing these huge differences in their bills this year and they're going oh my gosh why\nBecause if you didn't choose your rate plan a PS chose it for you and you're seeing a build that might have been two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars last year as high as five hundred you might you may be seeing a three hundred dollar bill over six seven hundred dollars and people are quite we're not using any more power they might even be using a little bit less\nThis is only going to get worse\nIf you don't figure this out now to produce your own power pay less for it and here's another really important point as wise as it was to go solar previous years and I commend all of\nMy family's that worked with me previous years there's the ... the the the federal and state tax credit is available to you most people that's over ten thousand dollars to you\nAnd then the buyback program a PS has ... is is is after August thirty first it's TB deep to beat the tournament so\nIf you are going to do something this is really the time to do it because there's so many benefits and I say to my family is\nNumber one benefit is savings you are going to save\nThousands upon thousands of dollars off your power cost and the other is to live more comfortably in your home why should the power company dictate how much power we use and when we use it now between three and eight PM and it's the peak demand power in a P. S. S. or peace between one in eight\nSo why should the electric company dictate when we are comfortable that's the hardest time of the day when we get home from work wanting to enjoy our homes that we've worked hard for\nAnd another thing the our power claws stuck into our home is our highest expense that will have in our lifetime so why is consumers you you've gone by your house and you know what you can afford you know kind of car you can afford\nYour ... those should be no different producing your own power and paying less for between seven and eight cents per kilowatt is what it works out to being when you work with me I'm going to show you how to produce your own up between Seventy cents for a lot more of your hard earned money back in your pocket not the ...\nI have to say to that you have been doing this for several years it's not like you just turned around and decided to do that\nYou are very educated basically what he's going to do is talk to you a little bit about how even read your power bill wouldn't it be nice to know what it really means and that way when she educates you know you can do make an informed decision\nExactly Carole and I mean you know I Love when you say people don't really open their ... just going to pick up the right and they go oh we're just going to pay that\nThat shouldn't be the case this is your home you have basically control over what you consume and what you buy you know and not about empowerment yeah exactly you take take your power back\nOkay now here's what we want to do we want to go up on that website you fill out your kilowatt were were ... ... I don't feel kilo where you're going to make me have to include some time today so ... what it does\nAnd it's not like you just turned around and decided to do this you are very educated basically what she's going to do is talk to you a little bit about how to even read your power bill wouldn't it be nice to know what it really means and that way when she educates you know you can do make an informed it ...\n... exactly Carole and I mean you know I Love when you say people don't really open their ... just going to pick up the right and they go oh we're just going to pay that\nThat shouldn't be the case this is your home you have basically control over what you consume and what you buy you know and the mock about empowerment yeah exactly you take take your power back\nOkay now here's what we want to do we want to go up on that website you fill out your kilowatts were were were ... ... I don't feel kilo where you're going to make me have convincing time today so ... what it does is it tells me how much power you used over the last twelve months and how much you're going to need going forward and\nI'm going to give you a little bit extra and here's the thing there's ... there's other companies that know how to make hamburgers okay and this is what I say there's only one that has the secret sauce so be very careful it's not just about solar panels anymore it's about solar panels in the right amount of them\nCombined with the right rate plan and with smart energy management and that's a whole nother charge on your bill that we need to manage people are seeing this charge an atheist probably for the very first time called demand\nAnd that is probably some people are going that's more than my power cost a combined with using the taxes that there's a separate church for demand we manage that and we mitigate that and you live more comfortable in your home paying less for
