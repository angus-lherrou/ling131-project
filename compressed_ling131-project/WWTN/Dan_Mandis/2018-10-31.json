the time to help children middle Tennessee diverse our family of ... associates or partying with just see children's home and raising money to provide sixty children with their Christmas\nThis group that puts out this ad essentially I Would say that amendment one is an attack on not only police officers but I Would also say that an attack on the communities that they serve because no I very much disagree\nWith the amendment one commercial that you just heard where it says that amendment one and oversight would make Nashville safer\nAmendment one will not make Nashville safer it's simply will not as a matter of fact I could very easily make the argument that will right now\nThat it makes it unsafe it makes us less safe the reason why amendment one would make us less safe is because of the fact that if a police officer as these are patrolling and here she is patrolling some of these\nVarious communities if they have to hesitate even for a second to worry about what the community oversight board is going to think\nThat makes his job and her job the police officers job a far far harder and we all know that because the slightest hesitation can lead to a police officer losing his or her life and we know that so if they are worried about we've had this costs\nStation a Brazilian times if they have to worry about what the community oversight board is going to think about there every single move\nThat is a problem and that most certainly does not make Nashville a safer place now\nWhat we also know in this ad and will not tell you is that there are already layers and layers and layers of oversight within the metro Nashville police department we already know that we've we've interviewed how many people over the past couple of months since this whole thing came about\nSo I Would say to accountability matters we already have accountability and it does matter what matters is that we do have accountability but you and your group and proponents of amendment one are not being honest with the people of Nashville\n\nAnd so this commercial which is showing the images of police officers who are against amendment one it's just another aspect of the dishonesty of the entire campaign for amendment one\nIt's just another dishonest political ads from an initiative base I Would say on dishonesty\nWe have police oversight multiple layers language officer or the officer that shot Daniel Hamburg\nWe know that he's been charged with what criminal homicide that that is an example I don't know if I necessarily agree with that I was a close one\nNow do you know that I myself I struggled with this uh on the air and off the air it was a close one but the bottom line is there was some accountability there the officer has been charged with criminal homicide I Believe he's been fired\nBut the groups who want this amendment want to pass I Know because we've we've interviewed a number of different people who are watching this\nWe know that they are anti cop we know that these are folks that are looking for power so this amendment or if it passes will be I Would say a voter sanctioned harassment\nOf police\nAnd so now we've got Jim small were the president of the fraternal order of police or he is coming out and letting the media know that there's a commercial quite simply should not be airing here's what they say officially this commercial uses photographs of several metro Nashville police officers without their permission\nIt also depicts the NPD officers as proponents of amendment one\nThe officer shown without their consent in the video are opposed to him at one and were furious to learn their picture was being used without\nTheir consent so yeah he's demanding that this will be taken down\nThey hope to Comcast will pull the commercial immediately enforce accountability matters to remove the unauthorized photographs from its commercial\nHe continues on it is troubling that accountability matters place the officers of the NPD in a position where they are potentially violating not only federal law but em NPD policy that prohibits appearing in uniform for political purposes without prior consent\nYeah he goes on to say this obvious air by accountability matters reinforces our position their position and this is important he hits it right on the head here this obvious air\nI Wonder if that was an obvious area that I'm not going to get stuck on this but I Wonder if it was an obvious era or if it was a done on purpose they knew that they weren't allowed to do this but they wanted to get to spot out and ask people see it that of course that day or two passes by where you've got the uh\nWhere you've got their their request to pull the commercial and all these other things and it's a cease and desist and you've got to pull this have Comcast but in the meantime it runs and people see it\nSo is it an obvious air war was it something that was done on purpose they knew that they would get a a cease and desist on this but they didn't care\nJust like they don't care that their campaign is\nI Would say not on us to say the least anyway he goes on it's obvious air by count ability matters reinforces our position that people who do not have the proper training experience and knowledge should not be engaged in the oversight of police practices\nHe goes on to say especially when it will cost the Nashville taxpayers ten\nMillion dollars over five years and not afford equal representation to all Nashville neighborhoods\n\nYou'd absolutely right I mean think about all the things that we need to do here in Nashville\nThinking that all the things that are not getting done right now I mean listen we are the city and there's so many different angles I could go here I mean all the people that we have visiting our city this is what a hundred people are so moving into a middle Tennessee every single day I mean it goes on and on\nThe number of dollars that are raised with all of these people moving here not to mention all the tourism it goes on and on\nYet somehow we are in a budget mess so we got this ten million dollars and where's that ten million dollars going to come from\nI'm a big promote proponent of police cameras in a uniform cameras huge proponent of that the reason why I'm a huge proponent of that is because I think that there are many times where the police are accused of things and guess what it turns out that they were innocent of the accusations that were leveled against them\nAnd the only thing that is separating the accusation from a full on a riot in places like you know Detroit Chicago Washington DC some of these places Baltimore\nIs a video camera on the uniform a video that is showing exactly what happened so for me I think this is an absolutely fascinating that ah they would try to do this but again\nThis is just the same the same I'm the same story over and over again it's a pattern where you have these folks who are trying to push amendment one and again my two cents says it's been a dishonest campaign or right from the start now Brian is in Nashville and is on WGN Brian where they say go ahead\nHi Brian go ahead oh why you know the male or\nA or wherever they are pretty high up in the metro government and that actually go to Leon Lett oh\nAll right thank you very much I appreciate the call yeah they're the ten million dollars\nIs a the amount that has been bandied about by not only the fraternal order of police but other folks as well but to Brian's point he is actually right when you start looking at some of the other ways and the other things that they're going to have to implement because of\nThis accountability board this police oversight board than a that cost the ten million dollar price tag actually will go up so that is the latest on amendment one people need to go to the polls and vote or no on an amendment want if you live in a Davidson county for live in Nashville that's what you need to do coming up next\nWe'll do a bit of a deep dive if you would like to on these are two latest polls from uh the from the Senate race to replace Bob Corker with Phil Bredesen Marsha Blackburn\nA it clearly shows that Marsha Blackburn is doing really well in the latest polling here's what's interesting about this\nWhat's interesting about these polls is one little passage in the passage in the poll in in the I'm In the story that talks about how the Republicans and and their quote unquote attack ads on Phil Bredesen is why he is now finding himself up behind Marsha Blackburn in these two new polls\nI'm going to ask

for me to more going to do the live broadcast out of the palm then I'm going to\nTell it back here and see a Marsha Blackburn Tom Cotton is going to talk about the issues going to talk about the election probably going to maybe talk about these polls as well but here's what's interesting\nAs you look at these polls one of the things that a lot of people have been pointing to is the popularity of Donald Trump and one of the questions that I asked a congressman Blackburn a couple of a couple of interviews ago I think\nWas when you go out and you speak to the good people of of Tennessee what are they saying about Donald Trump is this really about the issues\nIs it about you or is it about Donald Trump and she had a a a perfectly well crafted politicians answer and that's all good and ... blackbirds lead coincides with soaring popularity for president Donald Trump who\nNow has support of fifty six percent of likely voters and the NBC Marist Poll compared with thirty nine percent new don't support his job performance that as compared with forty seven percent new approve of the president and forty three percent new disagreed with him two months ago\nThat's what I mean what I mean is Trump is doing better than ever in the polls this is a very good thing for a President Trump is also a very good thing for ah Marsha Blackburn\nThey talk about how the latest polls come as Blackburn has four weeks sought to capitalize on the quote unquote part isn't driven fight\nOver the confirmation of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAndy caravan of thousands of migrants making their way through Central America and Mexico\nNow I I don't need to remind you of what I Would say was that just an absolute ethic fail\nOn the part of Phil Bredesen and his campaign when he came out and he said well you know just a couple of thousand migrants this is really nothing to worry about and matter of fact there was another show another um\nStory where British and actually said the migrate caravan is a chance to show that we here in America are grownups\nIt is that kind of attitude that is costing Phil Bredesen I Would say\nVotes from Republicans because according to this poll it does show that he is taking a hit from the right side of the aisle\nThe NBC poll found that thirty nine percent of Republicans gave birth to send favorable reviews in August but that is now down to twenty four percent in the latest survey\nSo when it comes right down to it I think what's happened is Marsha Blackburn has run a very good campaign and warning that people have Tennessee and most certainly Republicans and moderate Republicans at that perhaps\nThat Phil Bredesen is a liberal and he's trying to portray himself as a moderate Democrat and they were really kind of trying to portray himself as somebody who can be trusted when he goes to Washington DC and Marsha Blackburn do you do you remember it was during one of the debates\nAnd maybe it happened during the debate but she was just I mean it was over and over again where she said Phil Bredesen ... campaign is bought and paid for by Chuck Schumer and if you're watching the campaign if you're watching the debate you're thinking good lord man stop it already\nBut Marsha Blackburn she's got a history of I'm In marketing right that that's part of what she's done it in her past life as she knows all about marketing\nAnd so she knows that the more you say it the more people remember it and true to form what we're seeing now is apparatus and his support amongst Republicans is down quite a bit so I think\nAs Marsha Blackburn she has I Would say a very expertly crafted her message to paint Phil bred as soon as somebody who was bought and paid for by Chuck Schumer not to mention the fact that there was that project Vera toss video where we saw campaign workers saying that\nI you know obviously if you have you know listen to me before you know that I'm I'm all for the death penalty although I I have some issues with it because of the fact that there's a lot of folks on death row that we have found out later\nOr they were innocent and through DNA testing we found out that they were innocent but you know if there's a situation where somebody is just absolutely proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt than you know what he's in my opinion he's got to go\nSo years later when it looked as though Massachusetts might to restart capital punishment after a long hiatus a prison steward who knew this guy's father asked him to come in and see whether the old chair was still usable\nAnd so from there he just he just built this this reputation as a guy who knew a lot about electric chairs\nAnd refurbishing them in building them and so forth and and making sure that they were ready to go whenever they needed a ... you know pull that switch\nIn addition to electric chairs this guy built refurbished and consulted on gas chambers lethal injection machines at AIG gallows for at least twenty seven years so really interesting\nEven after he had a a ... you really want to Kiss My behind get this guy on the on the radio show saving and find them and see if he'll come on the radio with me I Would love to\nI'll give you even more candy corn for that 'cause I I'm not allowed to eat the candy corn since\nI says even after he was no longer welcome to the prison contractor after made those comments and prison officials continue to contact him for help because they literally had no one else to go to\nYeah I I think that is a kind of a situation where you're may not have the degrees but if you're somebody who has been working with these kinds of things your entire life will then okay so it is easy by the way 'cause everybody's worried about this whole like electric chair thing with the ... with um ...\nI've said I can tell you how many times you just go back to the firing squad\nYou does the Gore ski himself used a gun in the crimes committed when he killed those two guys\nIn a apparently if I got like a marijuana deal gone bad marijuana purchased gone bad he use guns in his a particular crime to get him on death row so why not\nGo back to uh the the firing squad\nWe'd all about to lethal injection and how these activists what they're trying to do is they're trying to do anything they can to thwart any kind of execution and so whether it's lethal injection whether it's the firing squad whether it's the electric chair gas chamber they always talk about how their inhumane and so on and so they keep going to a different methods\nAnd now we're right back to the electric chair so and this is something that is going to happen tomorrow and uh we'll keep you updated that will keep you updated on this by the way it does ultimately and I've read that so many times I Can't

couple of days that show the Blackburn is doing a very well\nAnd let's say it goes on to say and the Tennessee and given that the poll comes during early voting which ends on Thursday\nThe survey found that fifty percent of respondents who had already cast a ballot voted for Blackburn while forty four percent they'd already voted for medicine so we'll have to see what happens\nUm\nWe know that I Believe the Republican nominee for governor he he's he's in I mean that that's something that almost not even we're talking about but I Believe it will be our next a governor is well here in the fine state\nOf Tennessee okay there's a lot more that is going on and one of the things I Know that uh the president has been a really focused on has been of course I everything that's going on with the migrants ...\nBut there's a number of things that are going on right now are related to that and so let's let's visit the president's Twitter page shower ... because he is the most certainly been on fire the last twenty four hours\nTalking about not only the migrant caravan but also birthright citizenship so the president has taken aim at Paul why and now you remember yesterday Ryan was out there talking about how the president cannot do anything to birthright citizenship he he he cannot\nUse executive order to essentially eliminate a birthright citizenship and so the president has been on an absolute tear going after Paul Ryan and and talking about a birthright citizenship so one of the things he says is that so called birthright citizenship he said on Twitter for hours ago\nWhich costs our country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens will be ended in one way or the other he says it is not covered by the fourteenth amendment because of the words subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAnd he does say that many legal scholars agree you know this is one of those moments\nWhere when you look at this story\nYou think well we've always had this birthright citizenship and you can talk about the fourteenth amendment I certainly have some opinions on this\nBut for all the people and this was so it's certainly true in the media yesterday\nThere are a lot of people that are saying oh the president's absolutely bad crap crazy but the media will tell you and been Paul Ryan will tell you that you know they've really always felt that way about President Trump\nBut just because we've always done it this way doesn't necessarily mean that this is the appropriate interpretation of the fourteenth amendment when we started talking about illegal aliens and the children that are born here in America\nThe president also saying the Paul Ryan should be focused\nOn holding the majority because it looks the bleak in the house he says Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship\nSomething he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes and securing our borders so for President Trump\nA clearly this is something that he feels very strongly about it I guess there's a number of different ways you can look at this and and one of the things that the president and my parents are saying is that this is something that is most certainly well within the white of President Trump listen\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nWheelchairs language of the fourteenth amendment for the Supreme Court of the United states has never ruled on whether or not the language of the fourteenth amendment subject to the jurisdiction thereof applies specifically to people who are in the country illegally\nYeah and and that is as far as I can tell and again you know that I'm not a legal scholar I never even pretended to be one but what I can tell you that there is a lot of debate among some very very smart people and people who are constitutional is constitutional attorneys\nYou name it and everybody's got an opinion but for President Trump but he really wants to push this honorable open and I sort of understand the reason why the reason why is because he is feeling 'cause we've got a week before the midterm elections\nThe president and even sort of kept his hand there in his tweet when he talked about using the Republican majority the president knows that if he's able to create a national conversation on birthright citizenship something that a lot of Republicans a lot of conservatives simply do not like\nThe fact that a couple of illegal aliens can come into our country has called anchor babies right they come into our country and they have a baby and then that baby is automatically a U.S citizen an anchor baby and I don't know why I get it attack every time I used that term but whatever\nDan and Ninety nine seven WPN dot com if you find it offensive knock yourself out\nBut the question is does the fourteenth amendment does it give a illegal aliens the right to stay in our country and and the the baby that is born there up because when you look at it when you look at the history of the fourteenth amendment ... it was about slavery\nAnd it was about people that were brought to our country way back when as slaves against their will so to me there's a difference between I don't have the the time to get into all of this right now\nBut that's the difference the differences when the fourteenth amendment was was constructed in in was put in it was all about that is all about slaves slaves had been freed and so now they're they're trying to build a life here in America because of the fact that they are now a free people\nSo the fourteenth amendment was constructed as a way to help them assimilate into a life of freedom\nThere was a huge difference between somebody who was brought into this country as a slave against their will and somebody who breaks into our country illegally there was a huge difference\nAnd so that's going to be the question\nAnd you as the president says it it's all about this this this wording a subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens that that's what this is all about so the question is\nThis subject to jurisdiction what does that mean the president is going to say and he is saying\nThat people are broken into our country and are not citizens are really pledging allegiance to a nother country not ours and their kids are not deserving of citizenship and essentially that's what the president is saying\nHey now here's how the wall Street Journal describes the argument here's a quote opponents of birth citizenship try to obscure\nThis plane meaning by interpreting quote subject to the jurisdiction as applying only to those who allegiance to America because alien parents allegiance to a different sovereign the argument goes their children have no right to citizenship\nSo that's kind of where it's at right now is okay so if you come here and do you are an illegal you're an illegal alien and you have a baby or you are still\nPledging allegiance to where you came from oftentimes it's Mexico we know that is another thing people are saying is that one of the one of the people who wrote the fourteenth amendment as said this will not of course applies to persons born in the United states\nWho are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of persons but people are focused on that term foreigners\nWe know that illegal aliens are essentially foreigners right or one more point in Eighteen Ninety eight a specific opinion as some say applies to illegal aliens sort of\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled that a specific Chinese immigrants child was a citizen of the United states\nCiting the fourteenth amendment but that was an immigrant that wasn't an illegal alien and again I'm not somebody who is a an expert in the constitution in any way shape or form we've got people on both sides of the aisle and ours in ... all over the place as spouting their opinion here's what's interesting though\nFrom a political standpoint\nThe president doesn't necessarily need to do this I I get why he's doing it because this has been a flashpoint this birthright citizenship this has been a flashpoint for conservatives for a long time as has the situation with the illegal aliens\nNow a couple of things one is most certainly what this does the the right of birthright citizenship\nIt does serve as a magnet for people who want to come into this country illegally and then have the baby yesterday I told you all about a birth tourism and where you've got a lot of these folks who come into this country from places like China play places like Russia is well I learned this morning\nAnd they come in here six seven months pregnant they have their babies here in America so that those babies can be American citizens well then of course as the years\nGo buy what's gonna happen then is it easier for the parents their parents to come into this country as well it's all about I Would say loopholes and so that's what the president is trying to deal with but it is interesting from a political standpoint the president doesn't need to do that because\nThere are people who are anti illegal
