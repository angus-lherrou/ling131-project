now a couple of things one is the incredible I Would say self control\nOf Brian kill me tonight just turn around the clock this guy or push them in front of a box because that's what I wanted him to do\nNow clearly violence is never justified well maybe sometimes no it's never justified but if you go and you see the video on the damage your Facebook page I I Believe the you too will probably be\nBrought not to tears but you ... you really would be\nThat's harassment is it not that the the legal definition of harassment and stocking\nI Would say that it's harassment and stocking but if you're Brian kill need what do you do and I don't know if this was something that happens to him very often he's a very public figure in New York as we all would imagine and as we all know but yeah you would think that this is talking or something but I think I never I never threatened them now so\nIt doesn't matter stalking that you don't have to be threatened by a stalker okay I mean yeah\nAnd and you don't have to be quote threatened by an harasser either we'll hear harassment as you are you are disturbing that ... percent in their daily wellbeing and get the legal definition for you here if you if you need it that know what they're doing you don't have to threaten somebody that would be then you know yeah threatening somebody is around ...\n... and all the other than the other thing is as all of this is transpiring he's in the subway he's in the subway car he's in a smoothie shop not one person\nCalls out this liberal activists jak hold that is following bronchial meat from Fox News all over the city and harassing him not one person says hey why don't you shut up why don't why don't you back off why do you just allow this guy to move out the city in relative peace\nIt's a very dangerous situation and we all know that it's seemingly open season certainly verbally on conservatives across America he's in that subway car\nAnd you can kind of feel the tension you can feel the crowd turning ugly and not one person and I don't know how many people are typically in your your average subway car maybe fifty sixty hour I really don't know not one person\nStood up for Brian kill need this is what conservatives are are facing today folks so I feel really bad for for killing me to see is trying to walk through the um city of New York but this is what we've been\nDealing with all along and so you don't kill me was probably thinking while that was going on\nWith that I get to seven model BMW or just a five\nYou know that's actually a great point [laughter] I've often said Pamela I think I said this to once or twice or maybe half a trillion times the best revenge is living well is it not\nAnd so for Brian kill me a bell brings up a great point this is a guy who ah most certainly is living well and it's going to live well but it's still dangerous and it is still I Would say stalking it is a harassment certainly and so\nNo one in that subway car or in the smoothies store or even on the streets of New York nobody stood up for\nA kilometer and sometimes it feels like not sometimes all the time it does feel like they're really is no one except within our own party our own large circle of conservatives they're devoted to stand up for us\nAnd so that's why I think you know going back to what a week and a half ago now when when Lindsey Graham called out the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt was so cathartic because this is what we face every day whether it's this guy stocking Brian kilometer whether it's\nHillary Clinton you remember I played the audio of are talking about the deplorable and talking about how Donald Trump speaks you quote unquote that America ... and racist and and massaging is and sexual assault tours and all this other kinds of stuff\nThis is why the mid term elections is so important friends we had a huge victory\nOver the weekend with judge Brett Kavanaugh finally being confirmed\nTo the Supreme Court now as we all know you've got the Democrats they're running around screaming about how they're going to investigate cabin are they going to impeach President Trump it's all going to be about the mid term elections in what's going to happen if and when they get control of the house of representatives and the Senate will have to see what happens there is a long way to go\nBut when you think about the fact that conservatives all across America\nAre under attack I think there's Brian kill me story is emblematic of of what is happening in America today\nAnd so we can talk about how exciting it is how exhilarating it is how satisfying it is\nThat Marsha Blackburn in the latest poll of course this was a pre terrorists with their Twitter Instagram post or whatever it was yesterday but what we found out to early this morning was at CBS News and their latest poll shows a Marsha Blackburn is pulling away\nFrom Phil Bredesen now again that's before the swift effect will have to see all to mentally if her I'm throwing her considerable I Would say support behind feel brightest and really has any impact on the election but guess what\nRight now I think that it is this kind of behavior the behavior of this guy is following Brian kilometer around that is going to do when the Democrats there was a great piece in the wall Street Journal\nAnd it talks about it it's an opinion piece in it and it says here's the headline I'll get to a today Kevin on maybe the Democrats Waterloo so we'll talk about that because that is ultimately what a lot of people are saying\nIs that because the Democrats whether it's the hijacking of the Supreme Court confirmation process or Brian killing me walking through the streets of New York it is this kind of behavior that very well could cost the Democrats everything\nThere are people that are talking about wanting to send and I would love to do this\nI Would love to said Michael ...\nThank you card and I think a lot of conservatives feel this way today because we know that for a lot of people maybe a lot of independence for just a lot of fair minded people you know we sat around it and and we listened to Christine forward and we listen to everything that she had to say and that was all fine and well\nBut once they have an ID came around and wants to have an oddity brought forth his accusers sweat neck was ... I think her name was I Can't remember but it doesn't matter it was almost like a jump the shark moment because we had we had of course forward then we had when there is and then we had a sweat neck\nAnd so when ... you know quickly porn while you're comes out with all of these really horrific Scarlett creepy accusations against Brett Kavanaugh and I think that was the point where a lot of Americans took a step back and said enough is enough\nAnd people really started paying attention\nNow we know that that's probably one of the big issues and I'll go through this poll I Know Michael in Bryan both I spoke about this uh particular CBS poll extensively this morning so I don't feel the need to go into a right now\nBut suffice to say it is clear that this kind of behavior very well could have done in the Democrats for the midterm elections\nSo I say thank you Michael have an Audi I Would like to send you a thank you card sake you Maxine Waters thank you Chuck Schumer sake you Cory Booker who I think it was in Iowa over the weekend by the way kicking off his official a presidential campaign\nSo thank you to all of the Democrats\nFor behaving so incredibly badly to this guy chasing and following in harassing at Brown and kill need on the streets of New York thank you Democrats for what you are doing to the conservative movement big topic of conversation this morning on Fox News but this is everywhere and it's a it's a talk that we had last week of the week before\nAnd that is which of the party which of the two parties is is more energized\nIs it the left or is it the right I Want you\nTo go see the video of this jak whole\nHarassing by and kill me I Want you to perpetually listen to the audio of Maxine Waters I Want you to constantly listening listened to the audio of Hillary Clinton\nI Want you every single day to listen to the drawing on and on and on no not have your host will you have to have your house but also Chuck Schumer\nListen to them every

I haven't I haven't seen it but I I Would say that\nA Bradley Cooper perhaps was being a was being traditional in in the role perhaps I don't know maybe his frame of reference was the Nineteen Seventy ... person so I don't know I I tried to sit down in a while back and watch\nUh some of the Nineteen Seventy six version of a star is born I Know that I have you ever do this and in your mind where you remember your parents watching\nA movie and I have clips in my mind of my mom watching that movie so somewhere along the line I had seen some of it\nBut now it in my more political idled mind these days I Can't get past Barbara Streisand\nAh see and I just you can't put it on I ... I that that means you're going to burn all your your head and swift stuff no say no I'm not you can put it on the shelf\nAnd proven oil you know because Barbara Streisand is gone so far to the left all Taylor Swift it I don't want to get into this but all terrorists with you to be perfectly candid and I don't know if you've read her entire post I did I don't have it in front of me but all she did was she laid out very specifically\nWhat she didn't like about Marsha Blackburn in in what she did like about ... and then she encouraged people to look I encourage people to vote but but more than that ... and I'm not sticking up for Taylor Swift\nBut she told people to check out who their representatives are and see if they match your values right that's what she did and that is well within her rights I may disagree with her\nVehemently but she's allowed\nTo do that and same with Barbara Streisand\nAnd same with Barbara Streisand context of her argument is still the arsenic as as an alternative to strychnine though\nI just I don't get what you're saying I'm going to get your microphone away I think your bio rhythms are off a little bit today bail\n'em or something I'm not being funny she it's basically you know the lesser of two evils argument and if it's the lesser of two evils you're still voting for evil\nWell yeah it's been a nine point is for Dan is that I I I really think if you tried really hard you could put put all politics aside and watch a little bit of Barbra Streisand when she is\nActually beautifully acting and when she does she does maybe it's just that you've been exposed to Barbara Streisand in her you know what you are so long they can't get past that where ... is just beginning\nAnd I hope you're right that I wanted to she ends that here I I really do\nBut she has a right to to yeah that's what I'm saying I Can't as instead and Barbara Streisand instead as anybody else\nAnd here's my thing what if you're a swift had come out and said\nI encourage you to vote for Marsha Blackburn I Would love to have a a another female senator\nWould conservatives be all upset of course not elect would be upset so to me I disagree with her but I think the differences with Barbara Streisand she is such an activist\nAnd frankly is very much of a hypocrite too I mean I don't want to go down this road with Barbara Streisand because you you know but she's an environmentalist she ended up Al Gore right there's such environmentalist if they have these huge homes that are air conditioned year I'm ... I don't want to go into that but really all you know typical\nWell will say this though with um Taylor Swift track record and with relationships it's just a matter of time before Phil Bredesen prompts or\nLike you can I just tell you that that it is one\nSeventeen and that is already the oldest joke in the book right now\nIt is oh I see it oh that's what everybody in general not even home now\nEverybody had the same fought wages aren't what relationships that'll last with terrorists with I ... I ... it's almost like a well that's why I was saying earlier in the program when again in the in his a little voice or did he did he he had to point out that you know shake it off and not everybody\nKnows that I Am not everybody is that I guess I just remember it's a male audience remain mostly male men I Know don't listen to Taylor Swift I I don't know than I Do I Do All right\nThat's I was I I tell you guys you guys you guys are in a different category balance your name in music business\nNo cells that many tickets in albums and singles if you don't have multi demographics\nI doubt I doubt I Would doubt that many of our own male dominated listening people go to a Taylor Swift concert without their daughters it's because their daughters want them to go\nOut she got it out you know I'd pay almost totally got me on that and I mean I I went with with my girlfriend payment yeah\nYeah I mean she she liked to a swift too so I there there's also does those guys as well we'll go with her girlfriends but I Will I Will tell you this and wives I I'll tell you this though is it that was one of the best and concerts adventure I talked to ... yeah anyway so I don't again I don't begrudge Taylor Swift the opportunity to to speak her mind and\nAnd I just happened to disagree with it I'm not going to sit here for you know three hours in in ...

Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh this is huge folks\nBut it was interesting this is one of those moments where we all just felt that we all just sense did we all just as all of this was taking

character matters what kind of character have you exhibited over the past\nA couple of months in regard to judge Kavanaugh so yes I Would agree character does matter\nTennessee Democrats and Democrats

I grew up in the law Billy Joel with us\nCool cool yeah go ahead and looked at a polarizing bronco with about ... or oh very cool very cool yeah but I live in right now I got one here\n[laughter] okay

[laughter]\nI get it and it you know and then has and so I don't know why expects you to I I Know [laughter]\nUm you know it's interesting though about about that is you know my experience of course growing up in LA so I Would have ... to\nUh people that live in in like places like Malibu and a south Orange County in Los Angeles somebody's high flute and places out there where you've got these gangs and and they do they'll go to the more expensive areas now a couple of things one is they need to really pick\nWhere they break in because you know some of these some of these homes that have a lot of money attached to them they also have pretty good again losing well\nAbsolutely but the panic room thing is the part that's cracking me up though yeah I mean if you if you the outset of your home with quite the security system I Would venture to say you know\nThat I don't know it just it just seems like overkill to me it just seems like they they're looking for a way to spend more money and show off their money\nYeah by putting in a panic or I don't know you know I could totally\nNow the panic room you know if there is a tornado that's a good idea is there some sort of storm if there is some sort of nuclear attack\nAnd I wonder is it is your standard panic room is that also if you're able to withstand MS Thirteen ... nuclear war [noise] it depends on the panic room obviously so yes and if you were putting together a panic room for nuclear war purposes then I I Would put a whole bunch of wind\nDown there and that or or if you're on the ... you just get under your city public school or you get an accurate or are you know when\nPeople think about these panic rooms I mean how long are they going to be in the panic room and so my question I mean there there's something that people need to think about you so you've got to panic rooms that bullet proof can't break into can explode it ... you know that kind of thing\nHow are you going to be in there I mean are you going to is there a quarter potty and there's some sort of 'cause if you drink and all that long and I'm being dead serious yeah I Know you're going to sneaker and I heard it but the truth of the matter is you got all that in there you're going to have to like get rid of it so now I'm\nSure I'm sure that most panic rooms have I don't think they did oil it oh no no they do I\nDo on the on the horns on money to put the head right if I'm going to put in a panic room it's going to have a toilet I mean when they ... recalls nature calls and it doesn't matter if they're leaders in the house or an average panic rooms don't don't have that really yeah\nIt's just it most are meant for very short term use\nRight oh interesting I didn't know that right well in any event so but the point I'm trying to make is that you've got all these folks these liberal folks out there in the Hamptons and they're building the these hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of a panic rooms in their homes\nAnd they're all you know clearly as we all know fans of block Obama\nAll these liberals well the reason why MS Thirteen has been re emerging over the past many years is because of Obama's lax immigration policies so this was in the Washington Post I just I I kinda know a lot about this has been covering it for a long time\nThe Washington Post a way back in a way back but in twenty Seventeen eight nine months ago published this long piece showing how the illegal immigration of young people from Central America facilitated and even encouraged by the Obama administration has led to their rebirth of MS Thirteen\nIn the United states we we talked about this forever\nThe flow of so called unaccompanied alien children you remember the conversation you weigh sees\nClearly what the Obama administration did was they just simply allow these folks to come into the country and so that led to again they're re emergence of MS Thirteen from the Washington Post quote MS their teens new Porsche has been fueled by the recent influx of team and teenage immigrants\nMS Thirteen was waking after a long term in the uh top level prosecutions in Maryland Virginia and Long Island\nHad effectively decimated MS Thirteen in the mid to thousands and its activity had fallen off but thanks to the Obama administration they say from two thousand nine to twenty fourteen the number of ... or unaccompanied alien children apprehended by the border patrol mostly teenage boys\nIncreasing Thirteen fold from El Salvador Fifteen fold from Guatemala and Nineteen fold from Honduras because ultimately\nIt was catch and release\nAnd that's why MS Thirteen has now exploded in Long Island so they talk about this and they said and this is from National Review when the latest surge of Central Americans started the Obama administration spent years on the quote let them go option\nApproaching the surge as a humanitarian issue rather than a law enforcement matter I mean it goes on and on but I think you get the point\nYet those same numbers school liberals will donate money to Obama while at the same time and Democrats in the same the same lose your policies that is forcing them to build these panic rooms in the first place\nBut diluted take a left they they they can't they can't rationally think from point a to point B. okay we supported Obama we donated to Obama\nThose policies that helped fuel the\nThe Obama administration fueled all of this illegal immigration into our country and now we're hiding from MS Thirteen and forced to build panic rooms because of Obama whose campaigns we supported and we donated to [noise] I find that kind of funny to Seventeen\nOn super talk Mennonite seven WGN and that's why I found it kind of funny\nWhen Nancy Pelosi and I I talked about this briefly\nOr in the last hour\nWhere she was talking about how she wants all these uh Democrats now because of judge Kavanaugh\nShe wants to all Democrats to donate one dollar to help protect Obama's legacy\nAnd I think about that for a moment so you really want to protect Obama's legacy well guess what Nancy a part of Obama's legacy is theory emergence of MS Thirteen so why did you go there and see what did she asked the the find folks out there in the Hamptons\nTo donate some money to the Democrats because we know I mean good lord you know this is this is not only an an Obama discussion but this is also whoever the the next candidate for the Democrats whether it's Cory Booker or Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren whoever it is\nThis is about not only Obama but this is about the Democrats generally speaking because just what a couple of months ago we were talking about MS Thirteen and you had Trump talking about MS Thirteen and about how these people are animals I I don't even know if I Want to call him is Thirteen people\nThat's an insult the people they are absolutely animals\nSo I'm sitting here and I'm Talking about him is Thirteen and how it's a it was a\nA re emergence of the Obama administration as certainly this has also been as something that is bandied about in the mainstream media because you remember when Trump called these\nThese are guys animals and then you had all these more Ron's on the left saying oh did you hear ... immigrants illegal immigrants or animals no he wasn't he he was talking about MS Thirteen\nYet these same people in the Hamptons will get Nancy Pelosi's email and donate to the Democrats it makes absolutely no sense and this is why for a President Trump he is out on the\nTarmac earlier today and he had quite a few things to say about what's been going on over the past couple of days say here's what he said about the Democrats and their treatment of judge Kavanaugh\nFalse charges false accusations\nHorrible statements that were totally untrue that he knew nothing about yeah frankly terms that he probably never heard in his life he was this was that it never even heard of these terms was disgraceful situation wrote about my people that are evils\nYeah and he's talking about a Democrats he's talking about the media he's talking about the activist groups he's talking about George\nIf that's you know you really want to finally see
