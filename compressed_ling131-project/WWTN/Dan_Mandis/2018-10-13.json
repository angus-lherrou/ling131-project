J. lo the agent with the heart here with us today I Need to know where you got that\nJingle how is the mayor tapping my thought is that now and it really stays in your head\nI Believe that you know I've been on ... on your show several times and uh she always had heart jingle when I was so envious of it I loved it it said in my head I sing it all day and I told him I said I just want my own jingle\nAnd so I came in to be on her show one day and they surprise me Tanya and her husband Danny had had\nThis cup for me uh some guys they knew at Belmont did this as a side job and so they had that done and I played a and surprised me I've been raising it catchy it was really great it really was\nAnd they were talking about just the guys back into it we're talking about new construction and why you want to be represented on the side when meeting with a builder um quickly Dave people have questions for you how do they get a hold of you are just\nOn my cell number six one five three hundred seven seven eight eight\nAnd I try to answer that when it rings if I'm busy I Will call right back [noise] um I wanted to go ahead and talk to talk a little more about this new construction and and reasons that you actually need representation and really right off the bat one of the best reasons is to help\nHelp you choose the right builder for the home you want um you know not every builder builds the same way not every builder builds the same product\nSo an inexperienced agent who's been around would be able to direct you to the right builder who is good at what you want to do\nAnd I'm so I'm not all builders build great and in some bill fantastic and so um even though and experience agent may not say that to you they're going to know and\nDirect you in the right way to give an example oh I've got one that is really I mean this one was serious okay I had a\nI had a client and we went to ah they wanted to be in a certain subdivision and so the builder who we want it to build for us who was great\nDid not on this law so he could not they wanted us to take a lot so they he couldn't build there so we dealt with the other ... a builder and this they wanted this law because it was a basement law well\nI'm I learned right away that you really have to have a builder who is experience with basements because we don't have locks basements here\nSo most builders may not have ever built a basement\nSo when they built this basement it was horrible I mean it was terrible it did not have the full head high to did not have eight feet it had seven feet ... seven foot ceilings and\nI mean and they made it very clear up front and so I have I've learned since the mathematics of it all it really has to work out right and also because of the slope\nOf during our during our come from a ... conversation of trying to get out of this contract because it wasn't what they really contracted for [noise] we had a really riffing grains and the basement flooded\nSo there was no problem getting out of the getting my clients outta that contract I got there aren't as many bad ... everything\nAnd um that house did sell lighter to someone I don't know what they did to correct those issues but since then I I work with a builder and he just built\nA basement home for one of my clients and I promise you it is like the greatest basement everything is wonderful nine foot ceilings in the basement\nAnd he even they wanted a um a storm room [noise] and ah he built like and Ken about twelve\nRoom with all kinds of um\nRebar and counter I mean more than ... overkill okay so um so that rooms not going anywhere in is organized guys uh-huh and um [noise] so but and we've had terrible rains all through the building and since and\nOver and over and they if they reduce the price on one than their appraisal may be messed up on the next one so they've got to keep their prices and it's really and\nAnd the new buyers best interests because they uh integrity of the neighborhood is going to stay and um and their values gonna keep going up\nSo the second question is will they pay closing costs now that is um that's probably a fifty fifty\nA thing some ... builders in this market it is hard to get your closing costs paid but I'm a some builders will pay it and some just will not some builders it's full price and and nothing no though yeah and I want to be able to prepare\nMy clients for that and then I also want to talk to the lender and make sure that they're aware of it and\nSometimes a builder will have a preferred lender and I always wanted to check into that preferred lender and make sure that they're not adding to the interest rate to pay any incentives that they have\nI mean there's this it can get very complicated so um you need that an agent there whose experience than familiar with all of that as into office yeah to go in and and look at all those things for you so that you really know\nBecause I Can't tell you how many people when I go to lift the house they bought it new and they'll say we didn't know this or we didn't know that was going to happen or\nWhatever and it's it's kinda sad because each each home by an experience\nAt least the first three are really learning experiences\nAnd you want to take what you learn off the first one and use that on the second one and keep going so that's another reason I like to educate 'em but so you know I like to look at that contract and make sure\nAnd then I Will talk to the agent and ask them well they pay closing cost or not and and usually whatever they tell me a way still ask for it but ... you know they usually if they don't pay it they'll usually just come back and say no we won't pay it\nBut it doesn't hurt to ask you if you don't have that right that's right but is it a tried and then of course there's other things about upgrades to they have to pay in advance or whatever so there it can get very very involved in a contract\nSo you really want somebody there who knows what they're doing and knows how to negotiate and um and then during that after you've written the contract and the the process has started\nYou've really got to have someone on your side because if something happens that maybe wasn't supposed to happen\nUm you need somebody to be your representative to go in there and found out what it's if something's happened they can always say changed so it's just a matter of finding out why did that happen ...\nHow's it going to affect me and why did not know that ahead of time a lot of times this is a question that I ask a lot of times you go look at a lot and it's nice and level than your house gets built and you have thoughts steps and you want to know why [noise]\nSo you know they can't always tell us up front and how many steps but they can usually tell us there will be some or it'll be pretty level I mean they can be in general\nBut if somebody needs to have you know one step or no steps I mean you're going to have one usually\nThen you know we need to know that on the front end one no one I Would never think asked ... so that's why you need an agent Jackie [laughter] I Know who to call J. J. exactly\nSo um so I have gone to bat for many clients and I've had many discussions we'll call them with the builders and other agents and uh you know the thing that sets apart a builder to me is will they come back after closing\nThat's really important that's another time that that experience agent is invaluable to you as the buyer\nBecause you moved in and\nSomething's not right you know maybe they um [noise] maybe the floor is a\n... not even or it's given way when you walk on it or I in fact I had this another story I had a client and bought a house and moved in and it was on a slab and it had hard wood\nNow they always say that you should put laminate on hard wood and not I mean on concrete and not would and this was a slap house so um we were having problems with that flooring\nAnd it it did take a little while but we did get a whole new floor for this person what they had not done there's a level or that you can put under the floor if you do put hardwood down and that will keep it from giving on those low concrete areas\nSo this time we monitored it because she had already moved in she had to move everything but we watched and I put all that level are all over the the um ... so that her floor was perfect after that\nSo so that was another thing I have I came back I went back in there and that builder came back and fixed it so that's where I give the but grade to the builder I say is that typical or it just really different than they were well it's typical with the builders I like to use\n'em because if I ever have one who doesn't come back for my client then it's it's I won't come back they won't see me again so you know and you you don't really want to make real estate agents\nMad because we control a lot of them are saying yeah division yeah a visiting so we do\nUm but so there's lots of reasons that we can represent you during during the process and of course then it comes to the walk for okay so um after you have a\nStressed out and gone through all the building process and you know you you go to the house every day to look at it and you see holes in the wall and you think oh my gosh why is that there and\nIt's there for a reason there's they're doing something in there and it's going to be covered up but you don't know that so we get through all of that and then we then we do our walk through a usually a week before closing its the homeowner orientation and the walk through\nUm so we go through and we look at everything and that's our blue tape walk through\nWe call it and any cosmetic\nPaint issues or or ... shoes it gets flu type and I can just tell you for sure that when I leave a walk through that house looks like it's been in a wreck winding everything out I yes I mean the homeowner will go through and then I go behind them\nAnd uh because sometimes they're a little intimidated too I'm sure a lot of them don't know what they're looking for exactly so um you know I have certain spots on though to look and all that so um\nI I enjoy doing that with them and they get the feel of the home and there but that's when they started getting excited and that's when I get excited so we do that walk through and then they have a weight to um to do the to do all of those uh upgrade repairs that we put in place\nGosh I Do want to get into home inspections all that with you or you recommend that um we are going to be taking a little break here shortly you guys are listening to the tiny ask about real estate shell this is Jackie heard it's within our interlinked mortgage and we have Jay Jay last year with three Maxine lead they will be back with you guys\n...

all the answers you want to tell you one more thing before we go to the phone lines were going to talk to Jeff here and just a second\nA misconception about the doctor electric show\nAnd asked is that it's just an advice show because some people think well you know they'll call Joel and they'll say hey do you know somebody who can come out into so much uh the doctor electric show full of advice but he actually goes out and does the work I mean he's got crews who go out there and do that and if you ever see a Jay ...\nElectric a van service struck pull up in your driveway don't be alarmed\nBecause that's his commercial side of the business a J em I don't know where he got there but Joe Macri Jay ... maybe that's it but anyway\nHe has two sides of the business the commercial side is wired a lot of ... and ... gas stations all the way down to changing light bulbs and a house so not just an advice yo yes Joe screw actually does go out and do the same thing for jury doesn't mean you're you're not just an advice guy you actually go out and install too\nAmong Jews working in plentiful inside the historic girl [laughter] I don't believe in marriage or somebody working out

guarantee you had to be our side the [laughter] or was it was\nShe had a a box mounted in one of her walls it was in a pretty bad shape\nOr memory of little burn up towards real short the innocent Cody messed up so you just gotta remember ... when you do do you do\nIn ... eleven or something like that ... billion was oh what a memory you know there was born in burn off in a real short so we kind of ... matter of fact shed wires were suddenly cut the box out and put it back out you know make it for the CIA [laughter] yeah\nIt was not a good situation I was growing up with\nBut my question to die for y'all was uh I put a a maybe a nurse system in my house a while back and I want to do a it's a split system it's a full by someone else\nAnd I actually want to do a good I knew a return Ira box underneath the inside humid there a specific size because of the one up build is actually quite a bit bigger than the one that is under that's getting in bad shape\nBut well I mess up the ballot for my system put it in a bigger retarded our box underneath the moon\nI'm no gift now I mean it's hard to go to ... really mess it up by going bigger especially they'll never return that's one one thing\nAt that to yeah I just want to bigger and I wanted I had a a drawing to a you know built it up laws using the pressure trade would want it out with a sheet metal\nYeah yeah I mean that sounds

pull this out from the doctor electric email bag and by the way if you'd like to email the doctor electric\nShow maybe it'll show I don't want to talk on the radio or maybe just a don't have time but you would you could hear it here is the email\nAddress for Dr electric very simple de our electric tea and then at Gmail dot com the our electric tea and at Gmail dot com and this from Charles says hey I'd like to speak to somebody about\nInstalling several electrical outlets in my garage and just wondered you know just a general price range what that might cost\n[noise] um the ... at least in the garage just remember has to be gee if I protected so if you just one for you know drill lights nothing big you can probably in a garage now depends on how if there's addict or if it's going to be surfers ... figure the worst way\nThe hardest as you know if you don't have an addict we can pipe it in but you can probably figured sixty to Ninety dollars and outlet that's labor and material so\nIf you have three would it be a conduit you know we struck down the sheet rock ... you can look at a hundred and eighty bucks a hundred dollars two hundred dollars um maybe a little more just for the material but it is a free bid when you say ... ad that's where we come out and we look at them you show us where you want to we\nCan do it the way you want and will tell you a cheaper way by seeing something else from ... like you might have a for instance your garage my living room we can punched right through there was a plug in living room edge one right there behind it back to back change that one in the garage did you find that you have extra plug\nAll right here's one more from Johnny says I've got some sparking with a stove I've got sparking with a microwave and I've got some ... some of my outlets in the kitchen and I currently have a refrigerator plugged into an extension cord maybe that's causing this can you help me with that\nIt wasn't we went there the other day um he lost a neutral for many us we don't call in the U.S when\nWe got there they are actually were after owners riser his neutral burn off from their poll and actually when I say neutral for you you know basically the ground is a hundred and ten you need to ours you get a hundred and ten you know ... is one ten in the ground mix it works so\nHis motives and stuff are getting hot and he's like you didn't lose some other stuff but these are\nWe going to step back up at the clock in the rain stopped working I think it's the clock the microwave clocks not working and I'm afraid we're finding something else wasn't working but nothing the matter of fact we can shift along the number four plants young as a ... it's going to need components to fix it but there wasn't any us problem\nIt is our set the standard sales event are fall permission is going on right now where you can receive up to a one thousand dollar rebate on select equipment with qualifying purchase or you can get zero percent financing for five years up to five years I'm with zero damn\nOrion so I 'cause I like to when I can use your money I liked that deals so the zero zero zero zero zero down zero percent interest all I have to do is make an equal monthly payment with approved credit for five years\nAnd on and on the opposite rather take the thousands you tell you [laughter] I mean the greed that got to know the only using your money because we've let's just say for does with I paid up for re ... whether you go and that's why we have those options there you go to Jerry quote me do my little Kevin I'm thinking it was a two term package and influence which they Fifteen hundred bucks I'm like that of\nSwapping out I don't remember what that was that close\nOur eyes to Franklin, Tennessee it was five and I think it's going to be Franklin, Tennessee let's go and bring Randy on to the doctor he electric show hey Randy\nWhat's going on\nWell I got a question I I've got a townhouse and berry farms and I'm In the wintertime our bedrooms upstairs and it gets pretty hot up there and just wondering what can we do to cook down upstairs at ... at night in the winter [noise]\nUm I assume you have one unit that just does yes money in it up\nAnd down and and that's kind of typical on town homes and and then unfortunately I mean we could always add at zoning system where you could actually have a thermostat upstairs and down a okay they've got a great we use a wireless when known a lot of situations like that\nUm where you don't have to tear up the walls to run you cables and ... and there was that wires and then you could actually put us zoning damper that controls the upstairs and downstairs that's I mean it's it's pretty labor intensive to do all that depending on the access but um that that's probably the best way to do it other than\nTrying to okay are you I mean I Know a lot of people that live in towns homes they just typically close events often upstairs in the wintertime they'll close those events and just try to suffer through it but I'm\nSo that won't they won't hurt the system to close to them\nNo no they're kind of on on town homes like that I think they are kind of it and the original when they built those kind of a plan for that so okay so did I on\n... downstairs and what we're doing is turning a thermostat down to about sixty five and\nIt's pretty cool downstairs that um it it helps a little bit upstairs\nRight and you may need to do the opposite in the summertime I mean you have to close events downstairs in the summertime and ... up and then in the wintertime it's the M between seasons that's really kind of aggravating cars and you know you need ... during the middle of the day and then a heat at night\nTo dry it does work 'cause I have a bonus room I've got two systems and I have my upstairs is basically a bedroom bathroom a bar in a just a big pool table room\nAnd we put we got him to his own with the summer's day in and were ... meaning my wife and said okay Seventy four and said you know the one in the kitchen area where she wants it and I don't even notice it the more I used to walk up there and see a lot warmer but it wasn't hard I mean there's there's already quickness quick and easy gives a\nBut there's ... ... it did really work because it keeps the you know whatever you want your upstairs sales kick on that you know just give you a sea of chairs or whatever you want for the temperature that some stuff in it\nYou know and it's all guys weren't had right it's just access some sometimes those town homes I just and I just pack 'em in there and they packed as much stuff in my small spaces again so\nI mean it's pretty easy to heat and cool but\nBut just having a variation of temperatures is a problem when I when I called the vents of upstairs we get a pretty loud pressures found like it's trying to trying to the best to get out of there um so it's not a problem getting them all\nYeah well you know I could would be glad to come out and just give you an estimate on his zoning and um and I mean okay it's a great option to do that we got to worry about it some ... okay you know just not fair that I've come up\nOK Randy project yeah you bet ... phone call hey by the way one of our great sponsors and the doctor electric show have you heard of Harris electric supplying fact Joe ... by so much from them I think it'd be immune office down there they got a little office now they're sometimes known as soon as you and I think they are even customer sometimes you will come in with a question I\nDo a multimillionaire everyday of parents now it seems like\nYeah so ... it's almost like you're employed there you just answer the question for me\nLately or do I mean there are ... are coming out or do newly relies on the different the cameras that are in their floods now people once you know they've got the ring ... yeah the doorbell because\nI haven't seen a rubber you go to the door to knock so well as through the ... really help because you just you know they're going around the house and now they can see it so right but I'm not a fan of the doorbell on because it does but you know who's coming but it's not going to stop somebody from trying to Rob is taking out the woman to the door to push the button\nAs it Harrison electric supply it's your number one source for circuit breakers transformers uh they've got switch words over their whole host of components um in fact a lot of people think well I you know you've got to know something got to be an electrical contractor to go in there because it says Harris\nElectric supply not true you don't have to know anything at all about electricity or what you need and they'll just help you right there you can find them they are\nIn Nashville Jackson Henderson bill Clarksville Cookeville Lebanon Murfreesboro you want me to keep going on and you just give them a call and find out a location near ... six one five to five five forty one sixty one six one five to five five forty one sixty one for Harris\nElectric supply the division of border states just like that did you spend what millions of dollars down there ...\nHas been the least amount of their customers there you go that's what I tried to\nThere you go you know went oh profits go All right let's see if we can get one more from the email back this is from Allen he said Hey Joe I Want to I Want to run a twenty apple line from the break or panel to a new established outlets that I have in the garage and I do have a crawl space so I'm just wondering what that might cost\nA dedicated circuit in a garage if you had a hard to see across space in the garage that must be on the side of the wall of domes grudges lab\nBut that's fine um let's just say let's give you around them or fifty feet you must have been a hundred two hundred and fifty dollars for labor parks the edges that gets ... and that's it I mean plugs two dollars or ...\n... ... dollars an hour labor so I'd say as the number one fifty\nOr you'd be really quick advice Jerry for those folks as we transition you know what they just get your runners checked out before winter I mean before you turn it on you need to

residents of the Florida Panhandle are cleaning up from hurricane Michael\nAll of the answers that you need was you see the changes coming through Dr friday and\nAh you know the big question that comes up every year is should I file on line or can I you know 'cause it seems like to\nUm you know what was that Facebook or the other day another twenty thirty million people compromised and you know maybe I shouldn't be filing online with the IRS Irving break into Facebook the Pentagon and navy and all this and that should I just you know send a paper return in or what's the best advice there\nYeah I think I think you kinda tip that the fact is you're not going to totally be able to protect yourself any longer there's absolutely no guarantee that your dentist won't get hacked\nOr with all your information in it the Internal Revenue says is that the they're very very that that any company or should or does try to protect everything that is out there but um you know I'm I'm a firm believer\nAnd he finally and I liked the idea of having that instant I guess in the generation of instant gratification of knowing it than receive its track we don't have to continuously worry that I Can't tell you how many times I have mailed something to the Internal Revenue service and then\nThree or four months later when you think that received it um and even have tracking on it and then come back and say you never responded\nUm and then you're fighting that uphill battle saying Oh yes I did here's the proof\nBut are you know with with the fall I never had that problem uh being able to I think maybe once in a seven years that we've been using the file we had a situation and again we that was an easy fix because here's the tracking number you know um so\nI get I think I like that along with if you eat filed then you get the gratification if you have a refund haven't had one of those and I can't tell you how many years but if that does exist for you then you know it comes back into your bank usually within Twenty one day so much faster than snail mail\nAll right that's the idea for that\nNow we lose that caller okay I was going to vote whether you're for ya I'm All right so we'll come back to that 'cause I Know people want to know so the thing about it is let me ask you this one question and that being people always ask this this time of the year if I Do my taxes myself\nI go and buy this uh thirty nine Ninety five fifty nine Ninety five you know tax preparation software is that it viable to do that or you know of course it makes a big mistake or something I could be liable for all kinds of things how valid how good\nA how trusting should someone be if they want to say well you know I Want to just do this myself\nWell I I'm a firm believer that if you only have a W to um uh you know you and your wife maybe you don't have W. twos\nIt really is something you should be able to do and if you make less than sixty thousand dollars there are even some free software out there so the difference comes is if you have children I'm and you're not sure are you supposed to be able to claim them because just because\nThe fate you gave birth to children does that mean that they're legitimately tax deduction to you because you pay child support doesn't mean you're entitled to child credit or child earned income credit\nYou're not entitled to your neighbors kids that may live at your house from time to time to clean them on your tax returns and that the kind of thing that you see happening sometimes when people do their own taxes because\nThey play with a little bit well if I'm head of household if I'm married I'm Single and each one of those obviously give a different story and I have more than one that came in and and basically said well you know when I clicked on head of household I was doing better than when I click married filing separately well of course\nBecause a lot of things that just allowed but they were legitimately still married therefore they weren't entitled to head up also\nUm you know so if you're not sure that you know and you still have a fairly simple tax return definitely try to find a way I Will tell you the iris doesn't take phone calls or appointments any longer very easily so it it is much more difficult to get some of that help unless you buy a software that offers\nUm tax payers assistance um which can cost you a little bit more money but maybe with it\nAll right folks when we come back we'll talk to Howard who's got a question about back taxes you're listening to the doctor
