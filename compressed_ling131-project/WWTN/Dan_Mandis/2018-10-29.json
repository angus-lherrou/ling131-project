euro fixing to fix\nYou get all these people that are that are coming from Mexico and and now we have all these folks again coming in this caravan\nWell if Mexico has the ability to do all this for these people that are coming up through Central America from Central America to Mexico and then into our country when the wind the world can't do that for his own people because you know what I'm a little frustrated with illegal immigration from Mexico as well\nSo a couple of things have happened since we last spoke of course we we know that now there are some five thousand or so of our find members of the military heading to the border tried to make sure that these folks do not step forward into this country the caravan of Central American migrants\nIs now traveling through southern Mexico estimated at around seven thousand people\nAnd they said nearly all Hondurans now one of the things too when we've been talking about this off and on for a not only a week but months folks is the fact that there are and the president uh keeps insisting and I believe that the president is correct\nThat there are MS Thirteen gang members there that are there are some bad on brace or in this caravan in this invasion so now what we're going to have is clearly a standoff\nAt our southern border in one of the things that I found very interesting\nIs you know Mexico the president has really been trying to get\nA Mexico and the president of Mexico and the authorities down there to to stop this invasion in their own nation you know how many people they had I Want you to think about this because it's been my contention all along that Mexico they really don't want to help they they really don't\n\nInstead they just want to make it look like they're helping but they're really not so they have like five hundred of their own law enforcement down there in Mexico to stop this invasion of nearly seven thousand\nSo you mean to tell me I Would say to the president of Mexico\nYou mean to tell me that your five hundred are supposed to stop this this invasion of seven thousand at not to mention the fact\nThat you also have been ah we've got a number of different migrants are any number of different caravans that are starting to uh also had towards our border behind this uh seven thousand\nAnd I would say the original caravan but we all know that it's not this is this has been something that happens almost annually for a long time and certainly it happened under President Obama so what are the things that we've been talking about is the fact that you have to stop these folks now\nBecause this isn't not only about this caravan but also the caravan behind them the number of caravans that are coming up behind them what did I saw a C on finding Guatemalan like what fourteen thousand or so people are coming\nSo that the seven thousand that are coming up now through Mexico and apparently there in southern Mexico now and they're heading north\nIs you've got to stop this original caravan and that will most certainly send a message to the rest of the\nCaravan time reading all this this morning and you know you've got a a number of caravans that are starting to a head out now more caravans from Honduras more uh caravans from Guatemala and also from a from a El Salvador\nSo this is something that if we don't stop it now when we all know this then it's going to continue to happen and it's never going to end\nYou know we saw that in Europe and so this is something that the president is taking very seriously the other thing I find fascinating about this is the media and now there's so many people in the media and I know that you're going to be shocked to hear this\nThey're saying oh well the president what he's trying to do is he's trying to use this as a motivator for his base to come out and vote in the mid term elections okay\nWell first of all this is a a legitimate I Would say national security issue wouldn't you wouldn't you say this is a national security issue when you have\nA thousands and thousands of people that are that are coming up towards our border they have no papers they have no identification the governments\nAre actively helping them come into our country or I Try and help them come through Mexico so this is\nSomething that is a national security issue especially when you look at the fact that there's a lot of these folks will say that I see\nI saw one statistic and I forgot where I said forget where I saw it but it was like Seventy Seventy five percent of these folks are are not women and children they are young males\nAnd if they don't have any papers if they don't have any identification if they don't have anything\nThat would allow us to figure out who they are that that's a big problem yes that is a national security issue so I Would say kudos to the president for using this national security issue to draw attention\nTo the fact that the Democrats oh yeah the party that wanted to abolish ice\nThe same agency that's responsible going after I met Thirteen yeah I think this is a a legitimate issue that needs to be spoken about in the mid term elections\nSo now we're going to have this huge standoff\nAnd one of the things that they're talking about and this was over the weekend is to how I think it was Sunday\nThe caravans longest days they say of walking and hanging from passing trucks on a sixty mile journey to the to the uh the city in Mexico or ...\nI don't know if you've seen the photographs\nThere are photos of and this is where people are legitimately worried this is not\nThis is not quote unquote fear mongering this is\nA people here in America watching these photographs watching these videos and looking at these photographs and and here in these interviews\nBy the way of people that are in this caravan and they're saying oh yeah there are there are some ... in here and there there are people who are up to no good there are people who are affiliated with MS Thirteen\nOne of the things that has been a constant narrative throughout this whole uh media cycle in this whole media feeding frenzy regarding the a caravan has been the fact that you've got the media saying oh yeah the president is asserting with no evidence those three words you kept seeing these three words over and over again\nWith no evidence that this caravan is full of MS Thirteen gang members and then from the middle east and so on well you know what they're it's not like they're going to be raising their hand and saying oh yeah we're over here and\nNow they want to blend in with everybody else our own department of homeland security or even said as much\nBut the other thing you got to realize is the media is is consistently pointing this is something that is nothing but walking and now we know that this is this is more than just to walk these folks are also a grabbing rides on buses and they're grabbing rides on our trucks and whatever else they can find with a four or Eighteen wheel\nYeah that's what\nThey're doing but once they see the cameras everybody gets out and walk so that they make sure that they can get video of themselves are all across America of them walking across the desert\nStory goes on the bulk of the migrants were boisterous on friday evening in their refusal to accept anything less than safe passage to the U.S border so no it's us or a bus even though again I Would have to ask the question what does this all about\n\nIs it all about opportunity is it all about trying to get the proper medical attention that they need is at all about gathering shelter getting shelter is it all about safety\nIs it all about jobs is it all about schooling if so then the Mexican president is telling them you are at home here in Mexico\n\nBut instead instead of saying okay you know what that sounds like a good deal to us we're going to stay put here in Mexico and we're going to take advantage of this huge opportunity no they're bound and determined to get to ... to the United states\nSo the more that you see the fact that these folks these thousands and thousands of migrants are saying you know what\nIt's USA or bus then you've got to realize yeah this is this is a lot more than just about jobs and this is all about I Would say trying to invade the United states at take advantage of our system here and they can get all kinds of as we all know it can get all kinds of freebies as well so so this is\nThis is a very big deal for the president because I Do believe\nThat between this and of course the Kavanaugh hearings and everything else that we've been talking about for the past two months I think this could be one of those issues one of those topics\nThat could bring out Donald Trump's base and if it does and and if you're part of Donald Trump's face and you're not motivated to go to the mid term elections in voting cast your vote or in support of Donald Trump from your local elections well then shame on you\nBecause this is what it is all about\nKnow we've got some troops headed for the border we've been hearing about the five thousand to\nA five thousand members of our military that are going to go down and support at the border patrol on friday the Pentagon approved ... requests for additional troops out the southern border likely to total and in this story several hundred but now the Trump Administration came out and said ah no it's going to be five thousand so I think we've\nAlready got I Want to say about Fifteen hundred or so border patrol out there so you've got these additional five thousand which means that\nYeah yeah so we're we're ... I'm I'm not allowed to touch a touch the the sharp objects which is probably just fine and well because you know I'd be the guy to chop off my toes chop off my finger\nWhatever I'm really glad that you're experiencing these things you know as an old guy so you can appreciate it more than when you were younger\nThat old guy All right very good\nI mean you you you will appreciate it more now you're older yeah and the beauty of it all I\nI Am I Am a ...

I Would say yeah David I Would say it is and I agree with you it's it's reprehensible because what they're trying to do is they're trying to assign blame not only on President Trump\nBut also and this is very politically convenient for these folks because they'll sign it to President Trump they'll assign it to\nPeople who are supportive of President Trump they'll assign it to Republicans ... they'll even assign it to the website the social media that this guy was on\nBut what they won't do it they will look at this one particular person and assigned blame to him and said they'll try and to make a a far bigger political point with all this because we know that for these folks it's all about\nThe points that they can gain the vocal about\nCurtailing the narrative it is absolutely about furthering and every day and you\nWill never never mind the fact that this guy who shot up this dog was it about Trump hater yeah we're not you're not hearing from about\n... yeah well that was my next paragraph down but he [laughter] you are absolutely right this guy this guy absolutely hated a President Trump and David in your community and I don't know how active you are in synagogue and and then the Jewish community but\nAre there are a lot of conservatives are Jews and and what did they think of what's going on with this particular story is there an outrage and ... and is there debate amongst your community the Jewish community about this\nI I think there is a yeah I I personally have a well my dad was like I said he was with the navy so I don't really have a lot of close ties with my family and I'm not very observant you know so I don't I don't go to a dog a lot but I\nI Do know a couple like yeah we're rare breed the politically conservative Jew and I I Do know a couple who kind of express the same feeling but\nYeah I've got my dad's sister my aunt and my cousin that they are your typical ... see there they are very liberal and to the point now where I I'll I'll I'll always valued my family of politics and so we just don't talk politics\nBut it's usually pretty well when uh when we do and listen I'm no Donald Trump you know I like\nI like I like as a result but I ... I wanted a cruise I don't think you know every time you\nDo drop it off and on on Twitter I just shake my head and this may be kind of ... ... ... ...\nWell you know I said I never heard of war and ties to let it come out of that man now and I have a lot of reasons that I like I write\nAll the power of the ... yeah\nYou know teachers are are you David you were talking about now I Do find that interesting so you have a bunch of family members\nWho are very much anti Trump and so then and you are you know sort of supportive of Trump and so one of the things that I find interesting is when you all get together you purposely don't talk about politics [noise]\nIt it kind of interesting when you're all sitting around the Thanksgiving table we got the holidays coming up you know we're going to hear about all these families are divided by politics is something we've heard of over the last couple of years when you all get together\nIs it almost like everybody has to make a concerted effort not to talk politics or is it easy not to talk politics because I'd been in those situations and everybody's just chomping at the bit to to start talking about it\nBut you know the end result you know what's gonna happen and so sometimes when you're sitting around the Thanksgiving table\nThere might be an awkward silence for a few seconds or you know a minute or two or whatever it is well everybody's eating and you know that somebody wants to chime in and say what about that a racist Trump and then it's on right did you ever experience that are either table\nYeah we'll uh my my uncle um I I Love ... he's a pretty sharp lawyer and every now and then ill or he'll he'll get the the sideways job in and and you know usually if I've had enough glasses of wine at dinner I'm always I'm always\nDown to throw down for the writer [laughter] we we\nWe always we always got to keep its of yeah because like I said I I Love my family and there's there's nothing that I never going to change their mind they're never going to change my mind but they're still my family\nYeah and good for your dad but that that is a great attitude to have by the way I was just looking\nAt a Fox News and they have this poll I was kind of joking left this poll on friday\nWhere and I forget even who did the damn poll but it was a majority of Americans find that there is a a political divide in this country and and I thought it was kind of funny because I thought\nWho was the world needs a high flu poll for that and Fox News shows the Ninety percent of Americans believe that the political divisiveness in this country is a serious issue now going back to and give it appreciate the call [noise] going back to what it is a group of Jewish or folks these Jewish leaders\nSaying that they don't want President Trump to visit the synagogue where this this horrible massacre took place over the weekend eleven people dead and so they're saying that they want President Trump\nTo disavow white nationalism before he comes you know that that's going to be something that Sarah Sanders is going to be asked about and it just a few moments when she takes the podium for the White House press briefing\nThe story continues on Trump and the Republican Party has been accused this is what's funny\nAbout about this because I I've noticed over the past couple of days even before this particular situation that happened over the weekend the shooting in the synagogue even before that\nI noticed that now the narrative is that oh yeah you've got President Trump and all these are Republicans they're anti Semitic\nTrump won the Republican Party had been accused of spreading anti Semitic conspiracy theories which blame Hungarian born financier George Soros for the migrant caravan currently making its way through Mexico\nWhy is this what do you believe that George Soros is funding these groups these caravans these\nThese ah groups that are helping lead these caravans through Mexico which I mean it's all over the place I mean this this is something that George Soros is doing is he's helping to fund these groups that help these these caravans when they've been doing this for a long time\nBut it's not anti Semitic\nI mean George George Soros could be you know any any religion any culture any of any heritage but it wouldn't it wouldn't matter\nBecause it's not his heritage it's not his history signed his his family his family tree or what have you ... that people are are criticizing him for it's for his funding of these leftist organizations\nSo there's nothing anti Semitic about it it it has more to do with what he is funding regardless of his heritage regardless of his his religion\nBut of course the the lead to the Democrats and the less they're turning this into\nAnti Semitic\nIt's a damn thing you've ever seen and and they do this time and time and time again you on our borders protected you're a racist you criticized George Soros for and funding these groups were anti Semitic has nothing to do with him being Jewish\nHe's finding these groups and the Democrats are encouraging it and so are the governments of these countries that's not anti Semitic that's a fact has nothing to do with it\nFact that he's Jewish\nYou get this guy ... got Michael Bloomberg as well and so the president has been critical and Republicans\nHave been critical of all three of these guys and what they do is they're they're putting a lot of money towards the resistance they're putting a lot of money towards the left which by the way is their right to do\nBut we're criticizing their actions were criticizing what they're doing we're not criticizing their family were not criticizing their heritage and I guess my question would be what evidence do you have that these criticisms criticisms are are based on a hatred of Jews you don't\nBut story after story after story will accuse the president and accused Republicans of being a bunch of anti Semite\nThis is what they do this is what the media does and this is what the Democrats do is they'll come out and they'll they'll label\nYou as some sort of an ... store some sort of a whatever\nYou're a racist you're ... you're anti Semite whatever it is just some of the most God awful labels that you can have thrust upon you in today's society if it fits their narrative if it fix fish what they're trying

I Apologize during today's press conference Sanders was asked if President Trump's rhetoric is playing into some of the acts of violence that country has seen the last two years\nSo then they also did it all it correct me if I'm wrong on this they did it average dinner with a K they also did it after\nThe Pamela Anderson Tommy leave sex tape was out like I think they they they jumped on that sex tape bandwagon if I'm not mistaken\nYeah can you imagine that conversation hey mom I got a great idea to start an empire\nWell they did actually sad but true you're you don't want gym that sounds great let's do that when I'm sure it was the mom or we just speculating I don't remember I I don't remember\nOh you don't have the time he leaves and Pamela Anderson Lee take God I stole it somebody stole it yeah that was their own present married yeah they're having some construction\nWork like somebody stole the safe out of there along yeah yeah yeah\nYeah so that's completely yeah that was that was a violation\nYeah but you know what they turned that or you're talking about business savvy you know they turn that around and they now get profit whenever they it attorney that yeah we went back and landed on you know if people are going to watch a movie we might as well make money off\nOf it but they didn't turn in you know became\nFamous because of it I Know as as you said can crash in but if I'm not mistaken\nI mean I I've always I've got two thoughts running at one time it if I if I recall I'm at the time yeah nobody knew who Kim car dashing was suddenly she's she's in the spotlight and she took that and turned it into a positive thing for her and her family\nI Would agree with that I think it depends on um positive like a young ... standpoint\nYou've had some millionaire is now you've done ... what what else could they did did they get an education I have no idea that the graduate college did they get an MBA I have no idea that they took something that was in your ear either it was either very negative or took something that they jumped on the bandwagon and so maybe we can turn this into\nA career and my question would be I don't know this I Wish I was the tape made specifically so that it would be released or was the tape already gone out and then I and I\n... I haven't I haven't hit the Google to find out yeah but but but back to the to John Bon Jovi and I and but I Love him\nI think he's a very talented guy I think he's extremely handsome I think he is a good writer I think he's an amazing singer a good actor all of the above sure he has a good heart he has given back to his community\nTenfold hundred soldiers are over the years I just disagree with him a little just a little bit on I think it's a bit just a tad bit hypocritical for him to make a statement like that just just a tad\nI wouldn't get disagree with on hypocritical thing but if you know it's such a minor point because I think we're both right and you're certainly right on the fact that the ... car dashes would ever want to call them I I think that they were very from a business standpoint they parlayed that that tape\nInto loaning wine maker firing Daniel purses they of course had the reality show\nOn I think it went from tape to reality show\nI Googled the tape and I almost silly it on a limb to get me in trouble somebody is\nTelling me that they that Kim car dashing released the sex tape after Paris Hilton came out remembered\nThat I get there was like a whole slew of sudden six states that were out there\nRemember yeah and and Paris Hilton was one of those that even though she came from a famous family with money right she was one of those that ... became\nFamous for being famous or infamous I say right and so ... the ... I saw that and then took it to the nth degree Paris Hilton didn't need the money the ... kind of\nDid you now the ... of the Paris Hilton does she released that tape on purpose it seems like that one was also of revenge porn but I could be wrong yeah who knows seems like hers may have been stolen to find them yeah I mean bottom line is\nI I don't know we I think we talked about this long time ago there was this whole slew of sex tapes that did come out and ... and there were um there were photographs also that were taken from the uh from iCloud from the member from the cloud around these various yet actresses\nAnd I was I was dismayed at how many of these actresses and I guess maybe this is all part of living in that that nurse assistant world\nBut I was dismayed and ... and surprised actually it how many of these women had\nAll of these naked pictures of million dollars\nThat is this is what we've discussed how there are naked pictures of yourselves on phones all over America whether you're famous or not people are doing that and I ended up getting their phones stolen yeah and then you've got pictures to hand\nStrangers what Jennifer Lawrence she got her phone hounding their shoulder nugget pictures off of it\nBut that it's not just saying that people are doing it but it's yeah they've been doing it all the men are I mean are doing it all the time and sending it to me and it makes me so mad 'cause I don't want to see it no no to all of you please do not I don't want to see it\nSo stop sending Pamela pictures of your junk correct cease and desist they're happy Pamela now you're not going to get any more [laughter]\nOkay I'm a butter resolved and I know I Know in stumped you but we talked about that before I mean it's it's this new wave of all it's not it doesn't make any sense why would you do that\nIt's not just women and it's not just men teenagers\nSo that's also part of this whole dynamic has been you know you have the card and that's the culture we're talking about the culture\nTeenage girls and teenage boys they're all doing it\nAnd so I think part of what Bon Jovi is talking about with this culture\nIs the fact that the ... if you want to talk about a legacy that they'll leave yeah a lot of business savvy a successful show I don't even know keeping up with a car crash into still on\nMy book it is and it was it was produced by what the ... but let's face it that was also the beginning of this a selfie culture and yeah part of this situation with\nUs sending these a provocative selfies to other people\nSo I don't know why it is that um you know these these kids still even today and women and men as you'd oh Pamela they still send these things out all the time and I I for the life of me\nIf it's a a week in the in in America there's another story of a kid who get yeah commit suicide because there's pictures of him or her up all over the uh all over the Internet there's revenge porn there's all this kind of stuff\nAnd the bottom line is don't do that I don't know why people continue to do just capital\nAs you're not going to turn it into what Kim ... turned it into no not going to\nKnow that that that's exactly right so anyway so a Bon Jovi going after ah the car dash ins and now I guess people are upset with\nJohn Bon Jovi but you know whatever if there's anybody who's got scoreboard it's John Bon Jovi I think he built what would you say you're you're the or the big news the College of their on camera too but I Would say that from the eighties hair bands there's two survivors only two\nThere's Bon Jovi and
