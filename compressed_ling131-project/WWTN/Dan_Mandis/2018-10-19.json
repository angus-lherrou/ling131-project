must be a gift I don't know I don't have the gift I'm terrified of stuff I look I'm some people remember actually go and you see jaws in the theater yeah [laughter]\nThat will definitely date me\nWhen that sharp came out of the water I literally came out of my seat like three\nFeet I made a total fool of myself and I I how do you stop reaction like that that was your last for crying out loud how do you stop a reaction like that by not going to those movies there you go like I have never seen a freight Freddie Krueger film I've never seen one of the I just don't do them\nYeah so there's a difference though between campy\nScary yeah and these days you know back in the seventies in the eighties\nYou know it takes a chainsaw massacre they were campy these days the scary movies are psychologically scary I mean they can really messy up psychological I mean you have nightmares and these other things some of these some of it that the the latest stat it movie with uh the clown all this kind of stuff\nPeople told me that was the scariest movie they'd ever seen\nDon't get me started with class I have little brother who is scary clowns as a kid you and Pamela for Penn was

I have to do before gotten all these witnesses tear up whatever it was I did they can cause you to cut me I'm from the gang of four I\nSo originally what was supposed to happen I didn't realize you thought this was such a huge opportunity for you David I Apologize if I knew that it had meant so much you I Would have just let you sit in for my you know rolling the gang afford it sound like I contribute all that much by what I Would say is\nWe're going to have to do a few things a little differently from eight thirty to nine\nBecause Brian had to catch a flight so I said okay I'm going to host between eight thirty nine and then I invited you to be the fourth member of the gang of four because I was going to be and I didn't sleep last night how's he or she was so getting Simon is enough for me to work on your excitement level\nAnd why would they were looking to on a friday man yeah I mean he's all your menu apparently\nSo so we you know and then Brian is white got cancelled or whatever and so he didn't need me to host from eight thirty to to nine and so I took my secondary role in the gang of foreign ... unfortunately a David ... you were you were caught I'm\nSorry you were working those words are just where you are not actually did sound kinda harsh are all good cry if I felt the splinters from being on the bench white\nTheir Rudy just lost his helmet in his mouth guard

can take my place on the gang of four if you really want to do it that means that I can just kind of sleep and a little bit\nSo really like this was all just an act which proves I'm the ultimate passive aggressive manipulator I got my spot back\nYeah I Do I feel a little manipulated I'm sort of minded look how many layer up down in ... okay sorry okay I admitted\nDidn't really matter that much then uh I actually enjoyed our conversation that we had a instead of that even more oh what area and the gang of four but thank you for even considering the in the first place sure she'll I'll take the chance to say thank you also for what me do this because I Do appreciate that and you're very gracious to me but I tell you I Wish I could have seen the video\nOf him coming out to bail me

E. T. too hateful eight feet taped and give back a little to those who give us so much ... V. E. T. to hate whole heat heat the\nHouse dot com [noise]\nHave your same veil Nashville\nYou were talking I mean I [noise]\nIt is twelve o'clock I'm Pamela for with your top stories the investigation into the missing sunny journalists continues in the U.S turkey and Saudi Arabia Senator Jeff Merkley says he wants to see President Trump take a hard stand against Saudi Arabia is Jamal ... was really kill\nHim in the administration is is try to find a way through this and which they don't disrupt the relationship with Saudi Arabia in any in any fashion and we've seen time and again the president or essentially giving Saudi Arabia the space to investigate themselves and that will more or less except their investigation which I'm sure they're working\nTo work out as a detailed a cover story to sell to the world\nMeanwhile Senate Foreign relations chairman Bob Corker says the Trump Administration must engage clamp down\nA this caravan to happen and the reason why is because they're trying to figure out a way to get the Democrats to\nCome out to vote and the Hispanics to come out and vote the Latinos to come out and vote and so the Democrats think that trying to rile up Donald Trump and get him to send the military to the border to stop these migrants is a way to get immigrants in this country to go to the polls here's what he had to say last night\nThis is the problem with them that one thing they stick together they vote together their bed politician Democrats horrible policy they hate ice they don't like our military right they don't like our vets are always fighting us on that lousy policy the one thing they stick together\nBut they wanted the caravan and there are those are the caravan didn't just happen\nYeah and we know this and we know that George Soros and we know all about George Soros he is somebody who is funding these groups\nTo make sure that they are able to get from Honduras from El Salvador and from Guatemala through Mexico and up into the United states and the president is absolutely sick of it he is and so the question is going to be this\nPresident Trump is trying to make it illegal immigration\nThe influx of illegal aliens we have the story yesterday for you that the number of people coming across our southern border is now spiking again and the reason why that spiking is because of all of this stupidity about\nUh parents being separated from their kids at the border and so the president totally backed off on that and of course we all know that the Republicans said they essentially panicked when they're getting absolutely blistered and crucified in the media and we all know because you're a WPN we are we are our own special kind of woke\nUp we knew that a lot of these kids and these are centers on the border\nThey added a lot better in those centers than they ever did in Mexico or wherever it is that they were coming from\nBut because of the political correctness of the media and the Democrats President Trump and the Republicans were absolutely pummeled and so the president he completely backed off of that when he backed off\nThen all the tough talk on illegal immigration dissolved dissipated went away because the Republicans the GOP they were of course running scared and so what happens when the tough talk on illegal immigration ends\nThan we have an influx of illegal aliens and that is exactly precisely what is that happening\nAnd so now the president with this caravan absolutely daring the president to do something to stop them from coming through Mexico and up towards our border leading to a big old confrontation that President through his own special kind of diplomacy\nHas now been able to reach a deal\nBetween the United states Mexico\nAnd the United nations to us and Mexico have reached an agreement aimed at keeping the four thousand person migrant caravan from reaching American\nThe plan was developed over many months see this is what's good about President Trump is we had this going on back in April and so he learned from that situation and said this will happen again and when it does we need to be ready\n\nSo over the last few months have been working on this they've been working with Mexico and apparently they've been working with the United nations as well so let's go through exactly what this deal is the plan was developed included a request from Mexico that the United nations high commissioner for refugees\nEstablish shelters along its border with Central America\nSo in other words it's Mexico's border Mexico's southern border as they you know the border with Central America with El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala so\nIf they're coming from those nations trying to get into Mexico that gets what's gonna happen they're going to be hit with essentially a roadblock if you will and so they're going to have shelters along that border and what that means is they're not even going to get into Mexico\nWhich means that they're not going to get anywhere close to our border\nAnd this is how president Donald Trump has managed to become victorious in this whole situation\nThe goal is to provide humanitarian aid to members of the caravan and either prevent them from entering Mexico or processed them individually as refugees or as legal entrance\nThere's this huge\nMexico was also agreed by the way and this is also huge and there's been a problem for years folks\nRemember the story and we had this long time ago where Mexico and Honduras in El Salvador Guatemala and these are nations\nWhere if somebody snuck into our country\nAnd they committed these crimes and we wanted to send them back to you know wherever they came from well they wouldn't accept them back you remember that we talked about this\nWell now Mexico has agreed to take back any migrant who evade they're processing system and makes it into the United states in the past again the U.S has been required\nTo house those who cross the border illegally until their cases could be heard and only after could they return them to their country\nSo now if somebody comes into our country and we catch him we immediately are going to send them back as opposed to\nAsking asking nicely if they would I go back to ah go back to the courthouse and go back to their hearing or their immigration hearings when the time comes because usually we catch 'em and then we say okay come back in six months for your hearing and then they never do\nSo now we just get that middle part and we send them right back to Mexico that that's huge\nUn officials will assess refugees and this is also important\nUn officials will assess refugees while they are staying at the shelters in Mexico southern border and then decide which ones have legitimate claims for refugee status\nBecause we know that a lot of these folks coming into our country and heading through Mexico they don't necessarily have legitimate claims and so the un is apparently going to be able to really investigate\nWho these people are and what exactly is running from\nThis is also important once a person is deemed to have a legitimate claim they could be placed in the u._s. or any other host country that has an agreement with the United nations\nSo we're not going to be getting all of these folks will will get a few of them obviously but that doesn't mean that they're all going to come here and I and I do think that that is huge now as far as the president's claim last night that the Democrats and George Soros\nAre behind this whole migration that this whole caravan coming from Honduras and El Salvador and a Guatemalan coming into our country\nOr this is a situation that is encouraged by not only George Soros but also Honduras and these other nations\nNow\nLet's look at the cost who is funding the migrant caravan you know this costs each person about seven thousand dollars\nThe average per capita income in Honduras for example is to point three thousand\nSo somewhere somebody's paying for this and it's certainly not the migrants themselves obviously it's George Soros evidence up Soros funding of an earlier spontaneous quote unquote migration have been found among the tentacles of support that flow from his open society group\nNow we know that he does this all over the world\nLeftist billionaire George Soros is funding the well organized anti Trump migrant caravan invasion from Central America that has been hitting the United states Mexico border in defiance of immigration enforcement several major ultra liberal foundations and corporations\nHave supported the asylum seeking migrant caravans\nAnd his funding has been tied to several of these groups that have spearheaded the refugee invasion coalition also dubbed by the way these Soros express\n\nSee this is why it's so hard unless you know where to look it it's hard to be able to attract the funding\nBecause you got this big lump of of billions of dollars they George Soros has\nAnd it just filters into these various groups and then these groups turn around and they help these migrants across the border and across the ... the desert\nSo one of these groups to the care of family detention pro bono project which includes the Catholic legal immigration network also the American immigration council that refugee and immigration Center for education and legal services and the American immigration Lawyers Association\nAt least three of these four groups are funded by George Soros and his open society foundation\nSo when the president says and this is what I Love when the president says that uh George Soros and the Democrats wanted this caravan\nHe's exactly right the\nIs how many in the mainstream media will actually covered this now why is it that the Honduran government is also involved in trying to push these migrants\nIn Mexico and enter the United states why if if all these people are fleeing the oppressive government and the and the horrific crime and everything else that's going on in a in Honduras in other places like Salvador in Guatemala why would those individual governments\nThat they have year round they've got a Christmas thing it Christmas display that I absolutely love

Rosie o'donald shot is that what you're saying that you\nCan say them but to actually do\nThey ever caught up in the firing squad or whatever no no I don't want you either dead or clear\nBut I'm saying if she actually participated or actually because of her words it instigated right actual coup right I mean that's a treasonous thing for her to say\nYeah but you can be perfectly honest I don't

stitches or your favorite pie kept that from the west would one podcast network\nIn vale Nashville\nStudio where dogs I mean I [noise]\nGood afternoon it as one o'clock I'm Pamela fair with your ... stories in Mexico city secretary of state ... meeting with is Mexican counterpart as a caravan of Central American migrants inches closer to the U.S\nWe are deeply aware that the the way that Mexico will have all the way you will handle this is your sovereign decision or Mexico will make a decision if leaders and its people will decide the best way to achieve what I Believe our our shared objective now\nPresident Trump tweeted Thursday he will use the U.S military to close our southern border of Mexico does not stop the caravan caravan of migrants me while those thousands that are marching toward the U.S they dramatically turned around\nAs they reached the Mexican border and Guatemala this morning the groups say they will return to try to cross the heavily armed border and continue on their path\nAnd we have people on the left that have been saying and doing that all along\nEver since Maxine Waters had that bit of a um a dog whistle as however likes to talk about ... ever since that uh that that please from Maxine Waters that has been happening I mean earlier this week I told you about Tucker Carlson right a Tucker Carlson came out and and he said yeah I Can't even go to restaurants anymore\nHe says there's one restaurant and I'm not even going to tell you which one there's one restaurant that I can go to where I'm not harassed but any place else he says I'm harassed all the time\nSo look at the behavior Trump came in\nHe had a certain amount of a peculiarity he had a certain amount of a noxious ... a certain amount of brazen ness and a certain amount\nOf honesty\nAnd that is what I think a lot of people inside Washington D.C we're responding to because for all of his boldness for all of his bravado\nFor all of these supposedly the insults and the actual insult that he threw not only against the Democrats but the Republicans as well within all of that was a certain amount\nAnd it was a lot of truth\nAnd say you can sit here and crying complaining in moan about the things that President Trump said and did when he was running for president and in his first two years of the things that he has said but guess what\nThere is truth to everything that he says or at least most of it\nWhen the president last night talked about I'm not going to you know re or redo the monologue and the first hour but the latest hysteria is the president blaming Democrats for this a Honduran a caravan\nAnd he said well the Democrats are behind this well of course the Democrats and George stores are behind this the president knows it the media knows and the Democrats and Republicans know everybody knows that the mainstream media knows it they just won't report on it\nThat's why the the president makes people uncomfortable because he is saying things that a lot of people don't want you to know inside Washington DC\nIt continues on Mr Trump's peculiarities don't seem unusual when compared with the extreme that bizarre in is not to say the pathology that his routine on the left\nI mean this is what we've been saying all along and the wall Street Journal just absolutely hits the nail on the head\nGo on among progressive there's a reason why for example and we're talking about this uh yesterday\nThere's this whole new dating app right and it's only for supporters of Donald Trump the reason why this is even necessary is because there's a lot of people who simply\nDon't want to associate with anyone who could possibly support Trump\nAnd that's why this is necessary it's necessary because if you are supportive of the president then your immediately a deplorable you are immediately or racist you are immediately a massage and is your immediately a sexist among many other things\nIt goes on among progressive ... tempt from Mr Trump or is an article of faith and hardly worth mentioning any more at a dinner party now that I did know 'cause I don't go to dinner parties they saw Idaho it's art\nI they say if you were dining with like minded people it's boring to go on and on about the president if those around the table disagree about him it seems best to avoid politics altogether now that's interesting right because if you are a conservative than\nYou could talk about the president and you can even talked about I there's a guy your ear to work who he and I disagree on on we're both conservative but he and I will disagree on some of the things that the president\nHas done and some of his policies and some of the sweet but we are able to amongst people on the white we are able to have a rational dialogue\nBut if you're on the left and if you're a progressive if you're a liberal if you're a Democrat if you don't want Trump impeach then you've got to turn in your Democrat card right and you just\nYou're ostracized that's what they're trying to do that to what Nancy Pelosi as a matter of fact\nThey say the one tires of politics as road rage plenty of people remain almost crazy with anger and the country's political and cultural forces overall remained angry\nDriving people to extremes yet civil rising and mitigating counter currents are work beneath the surface\nAnd they talk about the cabinet confirmation fight clarified many Republican mind in advance of the midterm elections and yeah that is going to be one of the big things that a lot of people are going to be watching for in the mid term elections is what was the ... effect\nNow yesterday we uh last couple of days right we've seen all of these various polls and we've been talking about this we've seeing all these various polls and they've shown a number of different things\nYou know you have the New York times poll that showed um Marsha Blackburn right up fourteen percentage points above\nPhil Bredesen and yesterday I think it was yesterday there's a poll out from I think it was a tendency in that essentially shows that are the they are tied statistically tied so I I don't know which poll is correct but certainly the the only the only poll if you will that matters is going to be taken on November ...\n\nBut the question is going to be when they look back on the mid term elections of twenty sixteen what was the Kavanaugh effect because we know that the Democrats we know that day and the liberals we know that they behaved really really really badly\nWe know that they expose themselves as infant tile and irrational\nAnd liars as we all know from Cory Booker so the question is going to be if and it does look like the Republicans will keep the Senate if the Republicans keep the Senate and of course we've got Trump in the White House for another two years\nIf the Republicans hold on to the Senate as I've been saying\nThat is where all things are from the Supreme Court I go through right so the president will nominate somebody for the Supreme Court and then you have the uh you have\nThe confirmation hearings in the ... vote in the Senate so I I Believe that is why the Republicans are more focused on the Senate than they are on the house of representatives and it looks like possibly the house of representatives will fall\nBut the question is going to be asked what was the cabin on fact because if the cabinet effect was that it helps the Republicans that that will teach the Democrats okay you know we\nMay have jumped the shark on this one hour hysteria may have been turned up just a little too much possibly but they're also could be backfiring\nThere also could be a situation where at least for the left they were a far more galvanized in far more energized by the cabin I'll Fight will have to wait and see ultimately what happens but anyway the wall Street Journal continues to talk about how the cabinet confirmation fight clarified\nMany Republican minds in advance of the midterm elections it half reconciled even many never Trump hers\nTo a president who has been you know they say so little to their morals or a steady taste\nWe all know about the never Trump voters they've been driven toward Donald Trump by the performance of the left the horrific performance of the left starting with the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee and spilling into the streets among the Maxine Waters and George Soros brigades\nThey are absolutely right\n[noise] solve\nPosted some of the damage to our Facebook page because at least my two cents I think it is absolutely right and we'll have to see what happens and we'll have to see what happens with someone like ... like Maxine Waters and someone like Nancy Pelosi\nIf the Democrats retake the house of representatives what happens to Nancy Pelosi do you think that\nThe um minority leader right now in the house of representatives will ultimately then become the majority leader because we know that so far anyway she's been very much anti impeaching President Trump\nComing out and saying we just don't\nHave enough reasoning yet to try and impeach the president but we'll have to wait and see what happens we know that if the house is a overtaken by the Democrats than what we're going to see is investigations and possibly impeachments as well and I think it's going to be\nAn absolute disaster for the Trump Administration and the agenda that a lot of us voted for its one twenty on super talk any nine seven WGN Dan Man to show coming up next I Can't wait to tell you this about how\nHow it is that there's

astonishing to me they say that all presidents who were old enough to vote just forty two percent actually did according to a Washington Post analysis meanwhile the national rate was sixty one percent and state wide it was fifty one percent\nSo state wide it was fifty one percent trailing ten percent behind the national rate and Montgomery County for what it's worth was forty two percent\nOne guy says and this is his reason for not voting 'cause this is this is ultimately in the Houston Chronicle um it's exploring the reasons as to why people are not voting so this guy he's twenty five years old he's often ... and he says I had no reason to vote\nHe says I just don't feel I can change\nOr if I could help change it I'd just be voting for someone who's solutions\nI don't agree with it continues on for one thing he says for every one thing I like about a politician\nTheir ten things that I don't like you said take Trump I like his tax cuts but then he's jacking up the deficit is trading off one evil for another he says I'll just stay at home and not have my blood pressure raised\nYou know I was talking to somebody about that the other day it's a matter of fact I thought that was interesting when I saw that particular quote\nBecause I was speaking to somebody at our at our station event there now Julie it was a couple of weeks ago now\nAnd he I was talking to him about the election and the midterm elections and really everything that we've seen transpire over the last couple of years and he said there are times when I just have to target literally turn it all off\nBecause of the fact that he was raising his blood pressure and he was getting to the point where all of the turmoil and all of the ... and all of the screaming back and forth was really getting to him in the aisle hearken back to the story I just share with you a few minutes ago about the hash tag uncivil Democrats\nI think we all know what that means\nAnd so one of the things that I think a lot of people are feeling and I'll go through some of these but I think what a lot of people are feeling is there just seems to be a my vote doesn't matter mentality out there\nThe reasons for not voting may vary by location according to the Houston Chronicle but feature similar strains of disillusionment and skepticism\nOthers say they simply don't care about politics often citing its nastiness by the way and don't want to pick aside see that's what's interesting\nSo there's a lot of people that are saying that the reason why they don't care about politics is because of its nastiness but there's a lot of people\nWho are activated because of the nastiness you know for example there's a lot of people who are a conservative and Republicans who were activated because of the nastiness on the left\nSo and the one hand at the nastiness can activate but on the other hand it can turn a lot of people away\nSo they say that they don't necessarily want to pick a side because both sides can be incredibly nasty and frankly they don't want to be affiliated with either one cell others said that they just cannot get excited about the candidates on the ballot\nOr the Washington Post analyzed and voting data for more than three thousand counties in the twenty sixteen election this is interesting\nAnd found that those were the lowest rates of participation as measured by those eligible to vote were concentrated in a handful of states listen to this West Virginia Texas Georgia Kentucky Arizona and yes Tennessee\nPolitically speaking these are all states that are mostly controlled by Republicans and all voted for Trump twenty sixteen\nDemographically the county's with the lowest participating rates are often impoverished sparsely populated and rural\nTheir residence make less money than most Americans and they're less likely to own their home or have a college degree listen to this the wealthiest counties in the country\nHave the highest rates of participation or the poorest counties had the lowest rates now I'll be honest with you when I was broke when I was younger\nI wasn't necessarily interested in voting either but when I started doing better than my interest peak because I realized how much money in taxes I was paying but I did find all this interesting\nThey also say that in keeping with statistics showing it showing lower participation a during non presidential elections which is the midterms which is what we're going through right now\nSeveral Clarksville residents who voted in twenty sixteen said they don't plan to vote this fall\nAnd they profile one person Blanca exam or on eight twenty nine year old restaurant manager at the el Toro a Mexican took Clara to care I'm not a Mexican restaurant here is that what it is time but here's what's interesting\nBecause I think that what people are missing is the policies of Donald Trump\nAnd how they are directly affecting their lives\nSo this woman says that she voted for Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHas not seen her life changed much under Trump's leadership so she doesn't think voting in the midterms this fall is a big thing now what's interesting about that is she works for a restaurant\nShe's a restaurant manager when the economy's doing well more people have more money to spend\nSo that's what she's missing she's missing the fact that President Trump's tax reforms in the bonuses that a lot of people got and the deregulation that the president has done over the past two years has really changed\nAnd improved our economy\nBut she's not connecting the policies of Trump with the I'm assuming the success of the restaurant that she manages another woman Rachel Beatty\nSaid that she plans to join her husband in not voting this year because politics has become too divisive she says one of her close friends defended her on Facebook after they disagreed about the allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh she says these days\nAnd this is absolutely true she says these days you or either right or you're wrong well she says I like some things Republicans do I like some things Democrats do she says I view myself as a feminist but I see some feminism is getting turned into hatred\nSo it can't vote this time around\nBut what's interesting is the party that's been turning feminism into hatred has actually been the party of the left and Democrats so you would think that she would take a step back and even though she voted for Hillary she would take a step back and say well which party\nHas been turning feminism into hatred and that would be a the Democrats\nNow here's a headline us are just I just saw this from CNN News or dot com\nIf you vote to elect a Republican House any Republican Senate Donald Trump is now letting folks know we will and he's got fourteen different points that he wants to remind Americans of what he will continue to do\nIf he has a cooperative house and a Republican Senate here we go you're ready here we go number one continue to cut your taxes\nI think that's a good thing I think most Americans unless you're on the left and and you like all of that money going to a larger federal government most Americans would rather have or their own money from their paychecks as opposed to letting the government hijack our\nOur payroll and in our paychecks which is what as we all know
