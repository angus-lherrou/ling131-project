she was older and I said before I go on a stool\nAmazing leader ... agents and so um they are I live maintain yeah and they're not even a team anymore they're my family I Know that's how they are such a big heart and just the knowledge that they had and they complement each other so much in regards to\nThe different talent and you know it takes a lot because I Know my husband and I work together too so it's like All right you gotta have opposites you know to be able to work together like that are opposite talent to be able to do that\nAnd they're really complement each other so as we get older we forget what each other's talents are though but Christina more dialed in and say that [laughter] so um so okay let's ... and\nWe have a Fifteen homes only Fifteen homes lots and that's huge when you say new construction homes that are moving and read a\nLot of people or you know thinking well I'm not going to do new construction I don't want to wait till next year I don't want to wait six months these are moving ready right now there's only Fifteen left you could get and by the end of December actually before December ...\nGet yeah even before Thanksgiving like at an early Catholic and get your own clothes in two weeks ... she's amazing so so that is great\nI'm so don't let that detour you from getting into home ownership and we already know rates are rising this time last year I was talking about rights at three and seven eighths right now we're talking about race at four and seven eight some cases depending on\nIf you're paying any points or what your credit scores you can be five five and a quarter right now\nSo we know that rates are going to rise that impacts are purchasing power\nA full ... percent in interest rates on a two hundred thousand dollar loan is you know over a hundred dollars a month and payment and as you get higher and higher price point it becomes even more impactful so don't wait don't procrastinate we know that we're in a great real estate market I posted an article this last week\nThat we're number five in the entire United States as far as real estate where people want to live so\nA lot of people I hear oh is it a bubble there's a slowdown coming it's just maybe making the market get more in line into reality of where it that\nWas really as normal a yeah I mean you know it's not you're not going to have five offers over asking process about normal those unsustainable mhm but you know about that in order for you but offer you know ...\nYou know the ... the Americans to say I want to say real quickly we talked about earlier\nBut you know we talked about the way was with the morning\nAnd all the clothes and calls um but you also if you can get that otherwise you have a three and a half percent them frankly can be a target visual ... as I say so in three three fourteen that's you know ... thousand dollars you can get a gift you know from a family member and and get in\nUm we say very active on there we do pictures of homes that we've built we have planned everything you need to know and we're very responsive on that as well so if you see something that you like if you can't find a a rendering or the plan name messages and we'll get right back with you with that information\nOkay that's often ... All right so next thing I Want to talk about and we talked about\nThe company the integrity of the company hands on you don't find that a lot and and new construction right now especially model and most of your busy over but not with better you guys are building on a price point that is almost like a custom home like you're building a custom to that client\nUm and so that's what's really awesome because most people think oh if I got to do a custom home I got to go spend a million dollars somewhere that's not the case\nUm and the promotions that you guys do the care that you put into the product is amazing you've shared a little bit about the lifestyle I'm with clients you actually live in the neighborhoods so you must really love your home [laughter]\nPeople here on out there selling and and oh by my by by for my build or you you love that um and you know that the quality and\nStuff is there so I think there's a couple of things I wanted just to kind of as we're wrapping up the segment um\nYou mentioned that your demographics um can be from the empty nester to maybe the first time homebuyer so I Know I'm a lot of our listeners um have children they're easily a little bit of an upper age type probably more babies are tight mhm I'm with a mix of everything else of course\nAnd one of the things that I was learning and just this year doing a lot with sales and marketing council is there's so many men out there about buying a home\nIt could be a new construction I have to wait six months or nine months obviously that's not the case if you've been listening or and just sitting in right now we have Fifteen move in ready homes\nKathy can get them closed in two weeks you can be ... by Thanksgiving making your own turkey and at the latest if you\nWanted to Christmas fever [laughter] do you think giving didn't come and cook it myself [laughter]\nSo that's awesome so that is a myth that's out there 'cause a lot of times when our clients call in and they want to get pre approved and our listeners are talking about well I really don't want to wait or my children want to buy this home\nIf you buy an older home I'm not saying by old home as bad it's just you don't have the warranty so I Want to talk a little bit about before we go to break water ... what are the true advantages and buying new construction over\nResell [noise]\nAnd I think it starts with the warranties I think if you start with we have a ... so you're going to have a one year builder warranty\nAs what we have um we problem for homeowners and\nI'm at the end of that one year Matthew comes personally himself and he walks home with a homeowner I'm even most recently we had a homeowner I'm get a full\nHomosexual important then again just for their own peace of mind\nAnd they couldn't hardly find anything you know just your typical male pops and that's a year later that yeah and that's a whole year later and that Matthew definitely comes out and he he will walk everything and we even had the same at home when I go you know there's there's nothing on us are really care about and Matthew saw a couple of things that\nHe said you know I I'm just going to go ahead and take care of it for you anyway so um I Know that it's not something that bothers you but I'm just I'm going to do it mhm 'cause that's he wants people to be happy if he wants them to know that we're going to go above and beyond to make sure that they stay happy in their home yeah\n... most other rulers that on do you do but they hope to your passes weekly every year I mean there are so I got a call though her mind I'm going to go look through the house so that's that's like ... because ...\nAnd and I think that um I mean some people depending on area wise where they want to build a that's why I said I'm not saying refill is bad\nIt's just you really need to understand the benefits of new construction and especially if you don't have to wait and there's move in ready homes right now that's the key um but you know I've had some some clients that just wanted to be in this little cool little area and\nAnd within a year had to replace their conditioning that's forty five hundred five thousand dollars or their dishwasher goes out or\nTheir cross phase has stuff in it that maybe the home inspector didn't catch what the time but now they've got to do that just ... like clean out that calls face I have you ever seen those ... like if you get um what is it called refill them\nIt's like on a very small let's say maybe a twelve hundred square foot home I got a dead one time for someone it was over four thousand dollars and ... and so there's just there is some different advantages on\nYou know I'm ... naming some big items out there but\nWhat about dated cabinet dated countertop state exploring all of that if you go in and do you think oh well if I buy this resell home it's two Seventy five versus my new construction home was three ten which many do you have to put into it\nAnd what what is going to be your benefits behind it like what if that acey goes out you know replacing kitchen cabinets and counter tops and depending on subcontractors to show up like that is where I feel like a lot of people jump into it I think I'm going to get a fixer upper and that's the ideal thing and it ends up costs some way more money than what they initially thought\nTo where new construction has some major advantages over that I ... in my opinion and and doing this for twenty two years\nPlus like um if you want to compare a little bit um it's your it's like buying a new car you know you buy a new car you drive up a lot and it's great it's great to go and ... it feels good ride with me or war of ...\nUm or sometimes you buy a used car and you walk into a whole bunch of problems that you never force on ... and it's absolutely I think that's comparable to home buying 'em you know my brother for instance he bought a house had a home inspection dying\nAnd and they miss a lot that he bought it and as his condition he just wanted to know what he was heading into before he bought the house\nHe bought the house starts remodeling it\nThinking he's only going to pit forty thousand dollars into it and they are ... hundred thousand dollars later and he's like and he still has a lot more to go and he's like I should have just for what I put it into this house ashes botany mhm ashes built it ... and and I\nSee that quite a bit actually\nIf you do so I kind of wanted to just the kind of talk about that because we see it every single day and people always think oh I'm going to go find that deal that the deal it's going to be a fixer upper and it's just it when you start pulling up that flooring tearing down those walls there is no telling what will fall grits are going to Liberia\nHave their own show does read that yet\nSo definitely I'm definitely a is it it's a it's a different mindset and so if it's your first home you know look at and you can start to see what's out there and that's available and get it the way you want it at the very beginning because\nWhen I got my first time I was working crazier more hours and I work now you know what I mean you're starting you're young you're in your career you're having to work more there's more demand you don't have time to go home to Tor House you know are going oh my gosh you had to go to Home Depot because I got to repaint this or this or that\nAre ... to prevent that if you live at home that's chaotic your life typically seems to follow in chaos ... um you know um it snows then scientists or even so

I I could probably come and look at it but you even if you split it's the same thing I mean you can't take a two hundred a ... meter base in and say\nAt another pan off of it just for the outside you're going to have to come from off wherever your main breaker is unless you put the mains outside see what I'm saying like you\nGet right you can't pray outside and have one main inside\nI see how do how far from your house\n... what's that hundred she has a meaning just if you try to split it what you're thinking I mean let let's just say you have a two hundred meter based on a two hundred and maimed breaker panel\nRight All right I ... the means have to be grouped but let's just say you wanted to add a hundred and ... that means we would have to give you a three hundred amp serve and see what I'm saying because you had to Maine so\nYour your service everything would cost you more 'cause you have to increase the meter service sides outside your best way to a hundred feet of just go off your panel we should come an app it you're probably not going to be pulling too much and then you probably have plenty of room come off your panel\nBut I think there's plenty of room the problem as a panel middle of a square hole [laughter] what kind of difficult to come back out\nAnd allow them but we do their ... you know it's um how old your house\nI think it's about ten years old maybe\nDoes your do you have the main break her outside\nA you know I'm not sure right now\nYou probably do because if it if you're saying is that far from your major base ten years ago you would have had to put a main outside\nAnd and so then it's even easier forced to do that if it's in that way but just because you're panels in the house doesn't really matter we can learn through the basement addict and then go change over but uh you probably have a main outside and that's where we can change the breaker there and try to break a panel in and be done the same thing you're asking for but now you're means outside\nI Believe the main uh I Believe it at the break or outside of that like the breaker for the emergency people to shed at all\nOr no it's just it's a it's a coed meaning if you go more than five feet they wanted you to kill to be able to tell you I don't know if it on ... so you're probably in a better situation you thinking if you get time call we're out of ... come and look at it until you exactly the best way to do it but you definitely don't want to increase your service just for a little barn I\nAm I looking at a lot of money here\nUm I don't know it's a free beers with zero for that but a hundred pages depends on you know if we have to dig through ten driveways or rock you know but it it's not really I mean we do Barnes all the time is it a garage or a barn\nIt's a garage how big the like one ... to ... to go we're doing on right now\nWith a a bonus room upstairs in the bathroom in central heat and air and it's a thirty two hundred dollars I I don't know if that helps you I'm just I mean sometimes we do early ... and\nDo everything I can do everything in the garage I just ... feet to the garage just apparently you mean\nNo I can do the ban on everything and the garage I guess the hot wire from the house\nNo yeah the anal yeah especially if you want to do the digging even cheaper but yes no problem you just call I guess that's a free bed we can come out and show you if you want to write home owner if you want to do your own sweat equity and it will show you were to dig the ditch and we'll look it up for you give me the pound then you can have the rest\nOkay great thank you or I appreciate the phone call votes you're listening to the doctor electric show if you are outside of the listening area this radio station at any time she got a smartphone\nJust download an app called I heart and search W W T and and you can hear the doctor electric show anytime anywhere anyplace any Saturday\nMaybe in Russia too we always do a little shout out to boot and Casey's listening over there you know I've always heard Joe that he can understand English perfectly\nBut he sure to actually done so I don't know where that is true or not we'll never know but just a little side comment there in case somebody wants [laughter] if you like to learn more about the doctor electric show by the way here's the\nWebsite to go to DRA electric T.

exercise are almost too many dimension here in this one minute that I've got one but a new study published in the last of psychiatry and medical journal is highlighting the mental benefits of exercise and some people who work out had forty three percent\nYou were mad mental health ... a month at the days when the struggles of the things I stress and depression people who play team sports or bikers saw the biggest boost in their wellbeing in case you're wondering the sweet spot for exercising was forty five minutes three to five times a week\nOne of the study's authors that exercise is also an opportunity when you're not working for a relatively long period of time and you get things through perhaps reevaluate situations that have happened in your life that's exactly why I like to work out\nOn Dr Sanjay Gupta helping you live in a better life\nTruffles Illinois [noise]\nFears that record that Joel Macri love so much ladies and gentlemen from Waylon Jennings\nRecords of ... three playmates already from something like that [laughter] yeah it's not a forty five anymore is\nIt is but the other stuff that I'm a little thing my tropes when they\nWere talking about this the other day you know it's like okay so if you are maybe Fifteen Years or ten years old today you don't know what a forty five is remember forty finds I mean who knows what's in the record universal record got a hold in the middle but as federal in there they'll know what a forty five is a\nLot of them don't know what a phone is that one of my kids are close London or seen the clothes on ever cynical line\nSo I mean you know things are things are moving things are changing and let's go to Henderson villain brings Steve on to the doctor he electric show Hey Steve\nHey I got a good man how about you a\nPretty good at all anxious um after a day and night all the white guy we're right and a couple of them that well I'm no none of the raiders trip\nAnd it also blew out the AC adaptor\n\nNew sound just like a color just did the same calm I got Nashville the guy said and I actually even say when he turns on his like a stove why so bright\nAnd then we you know as we turn off the stove they'd get them um there was a call your power company Len checked demeanor block because what happens is you can have a burn liar\nOr a bad if it's not in the meter block you know they'll check door to the house\nAnd then if it's not there they'll tell you call us or whoever and you could just be something as a loose screw in the main break or something that's losing that is not making good contact and what it does it make contacts in orange sparks inside the panel and that's why you see a flicker 'cause it's not getting solid power\nUm on his and it was the block in the ... the block was betting on a piece of wire going from the meter to the panel that you can't see into it pulled a meter\nOr we fix it changes blocks ... he has ... why are we going to burn should've back in and in in our he was back up and good but when I plug in his meter to actually blew the meter up when they went to plug it back in because that they try to give 'em half power until we got there when they plugged in and blew the meter 'cause he's they shorted it out\nAn E S but uh you have nothing you either are going to have some small it's not nothing major it the pain of can create more power than what it gets from the power company but if the war's loose with a lot of times what you see a gym is because it's losing when you go back brightest not a surgeon actually weren't getting full power\nAnd then lose our again or ground so\nIf you had any has come out and check the to join to your house and the meter based and then the next step is they'll tell you have on our science find that you call attrition and it's probably going to be right there in your panel\nOkay and Israelis effects I mean this is not nothing is going to take four or five hours I mean within an hour ... two hours to most whoever comes we'll see it fix it if it's the whole house it's always in the panel if you just tell me it's just a bedroom and kitchen lights\nThan is the circuit but since I was just able to do all the home they when it when they tell me it's every lead in the house so it is easy call\nIt harder what is the only one like [laughter] yeah yeah it it's going to be in your ... meter box just like that and and do it and sometimes any as we've been out there behind any that's where they only take the two twenty and they didn't check it to one ten so they put their test on the two twenty and they say yeah we got to forty but\nThey've got to check that neutral men sometimes they forget and we come back\nWe've been there and said no that's wrong as you don't have power and come back and they realized will shoot you know we didn't we checked the wrong way and we only check for two forty wouldn't check the neutral side and the corrosion neutral get it fixed okay yeah\nReally I mean don't don't figure what you got you just you just need to and he has to come out there they come for free if it's on there and we can't fix it but if it's on they'll tell you hey get these to change the meter block and it will come out do that no problem\nOkay All right Steve appreciate the phone called team lioness Twenty one minutes and counting T minus Twenty one minutes if you just joined us we're only here\nFor Twenty one more minute so she's got a question now is the time to call seven three seven WWE T. N. seven three seven nine nine eight six job out I don't know Thirty years ago I had a house somewhere and I'm\nLike tracing came out I Can't remember what the deal is about ... said you know this this house it and grounded and we gotta we need to put a stake in the ground and in the house was probably a Nineteen fifty three house or fifty six or something like that but if you have an older house\nI'm a member of this guy saying what what is going to you know ground rule yeah just a ground rod put it in there and I like\nIt ... the ground takes the unused current sends it to earth so like um have you ever look you know for at any given today's houses for many as you have to hot summer neutral comes a house no ground is just too often neutral ground neutral or the same at the first means a disconnect so\nBasically any house in a I Would say in the seventies and under probably does not have a ground rod now he's the ground roads in in sometimes to\nA lot of homes now when they use plastic pipe we drive to ground routes\nFill it so if it is a house ... Seventy you would drive a ground you would put a ground ...\nSeventy in an old and ... yeah yeah and the seventies them back they didn't require it I guess you should say yeah now or ... to do so every house we do and and let let's say um this guy who just called us safe houses Nineteen Seventy and his meter burn up\nIf we replace that meter base by code we drive a ground road\nSo yeah okay when we pull it for me we had to put a ground rod inform so ground has run about a hundred and forty dollars you drive it insane foot long the bomb the house and it just it just it when they say is their house grounded you're not ground in the house your grandmother service is what it is when the services the panel\nAnd it was you know don't ground that the service what's the danger of that ...\nLike I said all them houses that they're not granted it just helps the power to get to the earth to maybe it might keep your stuff from blowing on surges in my you know where you don't get it back feed or I don't know if there's a danger because there's a whole bunch of houses it's better than ground and now many men we bomb them now for a safety issue and it helps to house\nHe's got that comfort D. H. C. comfort dot com the name of his company Jerry Denton and so I'm ... comfort is the local independent dealer for American standard heating and air conditioning and when we say that most people say well [laughter] so what\nWell he does uh he buys a lot of volume spends a lot of money\nWith American standard heating and air conditioning and so he gets that extra column in the pricing maybe it's column D. or whatever but Gerry has said on this show and I'll just go ahead and say it for him\nThat for the identical piece of equipment and installation he can be a thousand to Fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars less\nThan someone else who sells the same exact piece of equipment so always give him a call to get a second opinion Jerry Denton D. H. C. comfort we remembered the agency does he care does he come does it cost that's kind of how you remember those letters D. H. C. comfort\nDot com hey I got a question for you Joe we we talk about from time to time on the show a book pricing and electrical services versus by the hour and some folks don't understand the difference in what it can mean in their pocket book for the same work and so I thought I'd let you explain that\nUm look is different companies have ... just like mechanics do sometimes I'm like if you say a pound chain or the ... most of them do something big like that let's say\nA bat switch it might say charged to learn it always changes which I'm my charge six dollars for the switch and\nThat's what the book says we might go there and one minute here's which bart pulled out which is a dollar Seventy power service called mutts it so the book pricing as just they have a book they go buy\nA lot of big companies do a book a lot a lot of companies do but I don't do book pricing I Do feel like when we have an hourly rate but when we go out there you know a lot of times ... stuff apart like they'll they'll put a ceiling fan together for instance\nAnd they ... they just can't get up on the ladder yeah so they'll they'll take it out and put it in Boston we charge hanging families say which are two hundred dollars well when they put it together for us really there half the time so we actually cut the price than half sometimes because\nOur our calls an hour\nWith with their five minutes so we tell them and listening to it that they put the ceiling fan together in my guys are their Fifteen minutes and they don't have nothing else words do will say do you have anything else 'cause you know will change the switch changed recently came out for him\nIn at one hour because we're pay me for an hour right that's what I always tell them like you know when people tell me about hey can you come out and change that ... women all the time called me and I tell him listen you have anything else because it's not gonna take us but Fifteen minutes so if you have some and they're surprised because then what they'll do they'll go\nHold off on that call they'll go by hallway light that they want us to do or see a fan and will do over there so book pricing\nLet's say charge him this much for the fans as much for that light this much for that switch on the same our\nGotcha so that's the difference folks because for an hour's worth of work if you could put in ten plugs\nAnd sometimes on and do we move their couch so they can use ... has picked to catch up so she could back to learn to before began and we laugh because I tell him to take out the heavy trash cans [laughter] it's also it doesn't matter I mean if we're only their five minutes if in our culture you're paying me\nSo ... you know if you want to play swap them become a truck which is true for using material charge you but it's all the same price and at one hour right and we look at\nIt from the email bag here's what Charlie wants to do says hey love the radio show by the way we need some help with installing new ceiling fan I have also got a mystery circuit circuits somewhere that ain't working I replaced a faulty closet light I used to some new wire nuts and securely fasten to them now\nNeither it or the over oven microwave work every shut all the breakers several times just can't figure out what the break is we're out here in the ... by the way Granville\nDid come out that far also would like to do that but what do you think that would cost to fix all that\nI'm not sure we're Greenville is literally the reasonable for you you know this view for us but uh\nIf you have an older house I mean the lights in the microwave shouldn't be the same circuit so if it is on the same mutual you probably have an older home and you could have easily just when you did your ceiling fan on did the wrong way or the neutral is having the cause of light you could just under the joined it feeds a\nThe microwave and a lot of times you might have had a range wasn't at one time on the ... houses and people change out to a microwave sort of range would could be tied to light so it could be something real simple\nOn stuff like that it is we just come out and fix it and like I said if it's if it's a major thing where we can get to the war is broken the law will just delete it will just sometimes just quicker for us to run brand new\nIn in the one hour instead of trying to\nAvoid there two hours trying to fix the broken wire or yeah we'll re feeding him yeah my my guys know\nOn the type of boss were they call me and I'm like what's the matter oh we're still trying to fix the circuit we can't get I'm like okay just unhook it must his reward new and we'll just run new star going to be done with it I mean we're going to get in and get out but sometimes\nThere is a situation that we can't find the break\nOr the wall we don't want to catch the rock ours is a two story house we can get an addict between it so we'll just try to rewire it if we see a better way of the heck with delicious do new and we'll give you knew yeah there\nYou go and this from the email bag the wants to know would like to get a quote on getting a two hundred and forty bolt thirty app outlived installed in our garage\nUm depends on how far from the panel but if it weren't a dryer or something like that you you just spend a\nHundred and fifty to two twenty five and fits RV box new usually one ten thirty two twenty then you can spend like three twenty five three fifty because we're we're buying RV bucks and I was outside but uh thirty ... is the distance and you know we can and if you have a\nYou know garages slabs there's no cross but usually but the other side there might be there's an addict above it we can run ... nothing we can pipe it ends just whether you want to be seen\nAll right John wants to do this quickly I have several electrical issues but most needed this kitchen outlets that are barking and non functional and the idea on that\nUm yeah if you if you're plugging in something you see a spark and he put out that's just a loose tension um again the powers there that didn't spark there would be no power\nSo I don't know what it is ... how old houses but changing a plug is real simple to swap out as if it's um if you've seen a major spark when you pull up to court and we see that a lot it's just because the connection so loose\nThat there's attention if your plug pools that real easy and you just need a new re central meaning they shouldn't fallout meaning sometimes employees if you touch with your hand fall out of the socket yeah and that's just that's just change that blew up the tensions part is gone or strict you know it's no good\nOrion simple enough another great our here on the doctor electric show going to give you ... personal cell phone number nephew will give him about\nFive minutes to get outside the radio station I'll give you is personal cell phone number and you can give him a call\nAnd he'll answer your question six one five five oh for all eight to five job and Korea Dr ... electric if it's heating ventilation and air conditioning that you're upset about maybe want to get a second opinion on trying to figure out why something doesn't work Jerry Demings phone number six one five or seven eight\nFor eight old three one more time for Joe ... six one five five oh for\nAll eight\nTo five\nYou know a thousand years from the day you will be alive the question is where did you know that many people are just twelve inches away from heaven that's the distance from their head to their hearts\nThey believe in Jesus Christ in their mind but they have never accepted him in their heart and the biggest decision you will ever make in your life is where you are going to spend eternity the good news is you get to choose where if you don't know if you're going to go to have it I can help you settle that right now just say after me Jesus I invite you into my heart\nI proclaim you my lord and savior\nForgive me

caravan ... Saudi Arabia is that that does not know what happened to the body of the Washington Post columnist killed at its consulate in Istanbul correspondent then we demand\nComing from a source in the Saudi royal palace there they sat found some\nTurkish national whom they handed the body over to our we assume with the instructions have\nThose that they are somehow now that's different from the the narrative being put out by multiple times by unnamed Turkish officials who say that the body was dismembered\nWell what I usually tell clients is do not put your children on his co owners of the account so it depends on how that set up\nAnd the reason for that is because once\nThe child gets on the account as a corner that means that account as ... as much the child's account as it is the parents\nSo if the child ends up in divorce or bankruptcy those assets could go away and I have had situations where bankruptcy has liquidated a parent's account we usually suggest that you take care of the can\nIssue using a power of attorney had much easier document to work with\nYeah and I actually had a civil case in the last couple of years I can think of where\nThe money went to the IRS ... because the person ended up owing money and when the Irish check your bank account under Social Security numbers it came up and even though there was ways of getting some of it back I mean it was a lot more work you know I mean if it had just been a pie LA on that account it would have never been part of the assets is ah so\nYou know I Know a lot of times parents\nUm the other thing and here's another great question um I have many people come in and they want to quit clean the house\nTo their children while they're living and then have them still be able to live in the house but the house is now being quick claimed\nAgain why is this a good or bad idea [laughter]\nWell it it could be a good and it could be a bad idea descending on your circumstances\nI'm I've found that whenever a parent gives the trial what's called the remainder interest in a piece of property that they are living in and they reserve a life a state\nWhat usually happens down the road is you have a situation where the house has to be sold\nAnd then the kids or for whatever reason not willing to sign off on the deed transferring the property or\nIf the property is sold there's a check cut to the child for an interest that they're not supposed to be getting until they the parents passed but that isn't a dentist Feibel interests than any event the house is sold\nThey would be able to get some of the proceeds\nAnd so we try to shy away from that because it's not really structured properly for the state plans we do\nSo the step up and bases under that would normally be if they have a life a state not just I mean do you have to form some form that says life a state or what if it's just a quick claiming mom stays in the house\nOh if it's a complete gift and mom stays in the house then\nYou've given up that ability to get to step up and basis I don't know how am I in the when the mom dies and now you see a expose that home to their daughters creditors and bankruptcy and everything else we were talking about with bank account\n[noise] yeah that and and this in this particular scenario mom apparently it two years ago quick claimed it to the two children but she stayed in the house now she has sold it and she wants to downside and the kids are getting hit with capital gains\nBecause that's where we don't have any life a state paper work showing that mom had this state that she could still stay there which would have been free\nBecause mom would have been able to you get this you know the the limitations or the exclusion that you have as a as a main house I think\nYeah that's exactly right because the children on the home and they're not it's not their residence\nRight it's yeah so they're just getting hit and they they only have the basis of what the parents paid for the right to step up uh for the purpose of this so yeah so it's like that's the problem when people sometimes think they're really trying to protect the kids themselves\nBut they're finding out that when they make these decisions and not check with someone else simply establishing that second step if you want to do that and then make the life of state\nThen you could have avoided all this but people quit claiming is very easy for people apparently is and of course they put on quickly for a dollar right they always put it for a dollar really I don't have any basis\nAt all you didn't buy the property at least something you know All right we're going to take our first break when we get back you can join us here in this show six one five seven three seven nine nine eight six if you've got

normal in fact Tennessee passed a revision to their code to allow you to set up ... trust because people really yeah they see this is a need that hasn't been taken care of before we really didn't have
