{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "But it never learn sometimes the yes they don't read the latest ... road [laughter]\nDo you have to be careful about these pumping dumps to right oh yeah let's talk about a couple of buckets I Want to make sure that the bucket of strategy folks as it's just a way\nIt's not an end all be all but it's a way for you to divide mentally to begin with but then physically hopefully your money into three different places one is for immediate emergencies we call that the yellow bucket and that's for emergencies or money you need within six to twelve months\nThe next one we call we yell and read so it could be mixed it could be orange or can be read all the way it is your is your financial goals bucket or maybe your dream bucket and the timeframe for this bucket should be at least one year that's yellow part\nAnd could be two five ten or Twenty years that's read part of gay and I said I'll tell you why because basically anything that you're saving\nFor that can't pay out the normal cash flow in other words you have to have that money in at least a one year time rising 'cause a lot of money goes tied to the market that's why they call it the red they can go up and down so you want to leave that money alone\nBecause that's why we have in the bucket number one so if you need the money you don't want to take money out of your your ... your bucket to if the market is down 'cause you're walking in your losses so having those two accounts those two buckets yellow and the red one together makes sense but then\nYou say well gosh there's got to be a better way to save and not worry about the money long term\nAnd so that's a bucket number three which we called the green bucket and this is your retirement bucket and this is the most important bucket and this one that a lot of people that are listening it was something now he's like us we don't have a green book if we've got all her money or four one K. we've been told us our retirement yeah we don't have any safer options and there's really not that that's a red bucket not agree bucket but there are ways of your fifty nine and older\nYou can roll out some of your money in four one K. and get into your own personal lives green bucket or if you've left a job or two when you still have those for one case where if you have IRAs\nThese could be transferred into green buckets to your retirement bucket and any funds that usa specifically\nTo provide income when you retire and then of course you need to be at least fifty nine and a half and the green bucket before you take money out because if you're under that yeah that ten percent federal penalty if it's an IRA\nAnd this money would fall into the green bucket and what a lot of the accounts we see a nice the green bucket our traditional Ross step simple I erase board when case boy with regards to your piece they all are vehicles that could be in the green bucket\nRight again because think about it why do we save and all those accounts I just mentioned we saved there to have retirement but then we put the money into account where we could lose the money and so you know with Murphy is always says Steve ... if it's going to happen it happens bad or whatever so I can totally browned kind of law school if you have all your money at risk\nAnd you're counting that money to be your retirement money and then when retirement comes a day you reach retirement gosh it's happened to people today you reach retirement the market decides to take a forty percent point what happens to retirement ouch now you're going to do forty percent less things probably sixty percent less things because now you're worried and retirement and wanted to do\nYou're basically going to sit home and sit on the couch and watch Jerry Springer all day you know that's entertaining for me for one hour but I couldn't imagine doing that eight hours a day for seven days a week I lost about twenty minutes yeah content so it's not as much as you can take\nSo again that this is why we call it a\nBucket balance you have to balance your buckets properly\nAnd no one's going to tell you about this if you're in the four one K. it's all when the risk pocket there is no say well the safe option gives you one percent interest or something that's not safe that's losing money safely you need to be keeping up with inflation at least three percent growth every single year where you are losing money safely\nI Know what's at a bank gets into CD and you're all happy because you say it's safe but if each and every year we have inflation growing by three percent and you're only already one percent you're buying power shrinking were having financial evaporation and we can't have that\nIn a successful retirement plan that should last to be designed we designed our plans to last stage one hundred and Twenty one and be on\nWe can go further but no I haven't seen anybody won Twenty one yet but plants will go forever and then when you pass away whatever's left goes on in your next again that's how the troop land is that the truth of sharing plan and it has all three buckets to read the green to get what buckets one two three balance your buckets folks balance your buckets if you're not sure about this\nCall right now we'll put together you're very young customized\nBus getting strategy that can give you that total confidence as you approach retirement folks keep in mind a proper marketing strategy has these three items and these three items of the most important items at any financial or retirement plan

commissions\nVery important protection just like a quarterback has an offensive line unit office of wine around your portfolio and then income for the rest of your life with no questions consist of persistent reliable income\nWhen you decided to take it for the rest of your life no questions asked and hopefully that you have a couple of other green buckets one two or three you'll have increasing a gum away through retirement we can set that up or if you are with the next ten ... two hundred thousand do we know Costa obligation and you'll get that financial education and personalized bucket of

that's right he's got it so what causes inflation I'm going to a clear up this thing that we've talked about is called the omega\n... the omega fats if you've ever heard of a mega three omega six and omega nine most people haven't heard omega night it's called a record out of gas and\nButter mega three omega six on my mind those are our um our omega fats and the thing about your these essential fatty acids as they are either pro inflammatory or anti inflammatory so\nYour body actually is in Islam nations actually natural process um if you didn't have any information then you'd actually if you fell down to scrape up your knees would bleed out from your in the\nUm there'll be no clotting factor there would be no healing of your organs so information it's very important as soon as they very natural normal process but to many inflammatory\nUm properties inside of your body is what causes you have tons of pain\nI'm tons of back pain this is the kind of thing that causes back pain and headaches and in the shoulder pain and finger paying I Can't say how many patients come in the office we start cleaning up there in their information to their diet and their their old arthritic shoulder pain and guess what proof goes away\nUm their knee pain on and on the edge or my niece Thirty years playing basketball only remove inflation\nThen they're needed her anymore\nDr man I thought I was going to need a knee surgery well guess what I'm you're probably not because we remove the inflammation so omega three six and nine omega three as anti inflammatory\nVery very important to understand the omega three is at times laboratory omega six is pro inflammatory so three is anti inflammatory omega six is pro inflammatory\nSo what a here's an interesting fact did you actually need a ratio of one two three or one to four omega threes to omega six oh actually\nYou need to have more pro inflammatory fatty acids then you need anti inflammatory fatty acids I Know it sounds crazy but it gives we talked about inflation is a natural process so we can you need ... for every omega for one omega three you need\nThree omega six or ... but you would never want to supplement omega six because it's pro inflammatory\nThe problem is the United states we are so full of omega six fatty acids 'cause guess where you get omega ... fatty acids ready for this bum bump bum grain you get it from grain wheat\nRight so that's going to be um so if you eat doughnuts and bread and pasta gluten you know everybody has been gluten free pay ... a craze right now but it's really it's too much weight\nUm and we have too much wheat in our bodies and then also I'm a by the way this is going to be a good news Josh you appreciate this red meat is actually good for you if it's from a grass fed cow he just said well poop\nUm is is that exactly what you said look just like that was a high high tone of voice as such so actually grass fed beef is very anti inflammatory can reverse heart disease and cancer however grain fed beef is very pro inflammatory and causes heart disease and cancer and that's because\nThat cow that each grain is a cow this going to get a lot of omega six pro inflammatory effect if that couch each grass it's going to get a lot of omega three anti inflammatory effect so here's a cool thing\nCows that are grass fed\nHave a one just three omega three to make a six ratio\nSo they're anti inflammatory cows that grain right this is our typical beef in our fast food top grain of beef\nI'm stuff most of what you get a grocery store I'm I'm going to go by we give you some resources for ... beef right here in the grocery store I'm but those are going to have a one two one two you ratio of omega three to make a six which means he's grain fed beef are very pro inflammatory\nCauses heart disease causes cancer I'm just from eating\nThat pro temperature beef initial simple because those those cows that eat grain or ... how the doughnuts all day long and then when you eat that cows like you're eating the doughnuts so it's going to give you that pro inflammatory fat a side note I'm the average woman with multiple sclerosis\nHas a one to twenty two\nOmega three to make six ratio one to twenty two so that tells you to think about how valuable important is make sure that you're making threes or ... so I'm I'm going to get into this but I'm also give it of course we're chiropractors um the reason I Do the show there's so many people who listen for headaches low back pain [noise] um they're listening we're talking about heart disease and

our\nPainting painting your fingers joints shoulders knees or elbows man if you're somebody to deal with heart disease maybe you're on Staten medication you need to be paying attention to this show\nI'm Talking about exactly what causes the pain and we're talking about how to remove that pain\nFirst of all what causes it real simple information is caused by eating sugar and grain now sugar will kill you we all know that\nUm sugar and grain so when you eat it says you're eating 'em by the way the number I met promises when we left the last segment what is the number one source of inflammatory I'm a food in your whole lifestyle by far in America can your guests what are you the number one source of information\nOr not grade Joshua Greene he's wrong um it it actually soda but you know that soda is the number one source of sugar in the United states but the worst part about so does not even saying the sugar itself ...\nOf sorts high fructose corn syrup it's in our sodas and it will kill you met is so deadly for a cause inflation your arterial wall um it causes cancer cells as a matter of fact there's eight times as many receptor sites for\nUm sugar on a cancer cell is a regular cell that's why when you go to get a cancer stand on a PET scan what they do is actually inject you with radioactive sugar\nAnd that radioactive sugar finds its way to guess what your cancer cells and then gives off that radiation so they can tell you where the cancer is because cancer loves sugar\nSo obviously not only does it cause inflammation it spurs on cancer is not good to things that causes information also cause cancer\nI'm not good no boy do me a legal so what are we gonna do about it well omega three there's really you know five major things that we talk about 'em to remove\nThe information number one is fish oil we talked about again you want a good source not super high in vitamin a we recommend would called Carlson cod liver oil we actually sold in the office I'm at a well health centers and ah we felt that way also sell a really great kids one um they're all flavor they're called the robot the flavored say don't taste or the fishing is\nUm if you're familiar with called liberal they taste disgusting but this these are pretty awesome\nWe feed the kids and so we do\nUm smoothies guys if you're a smoothie recipe I'm every morning I a smoothie and it's not a movie that's full of fruit and junk that's gonna make you'd be like hungry and like five minutes\nSmitty that will fill you up when I say fill you up and listen I'm a triathlete also do CrossFit stuff although I'm not a big muscular fellow my metabolism is ridiculous my body burns close to four thousand calories a day\nIn my snooty winds up being like Thirteen fourteen hundred calories of course they want to teach you that quite that big a but this thing fills me up for breakfast I always uh fill me up is anti inflammatory and allows me to work a work at a busy level um do you have a lot of activity\nIn my life physical activity in my life and not be up with inflation it's also a anti I'm\nA cancer smoothie heart disease moody and also if you have any type of thyroid and balance our hormones will help get your thyroid back on track\nI talk about this moody in my I'm On line of a a website called food university dot TV food university that TV go on there a module wonderful university type TV is completely free you get a log in passwords free um\nUm and it's basically a forty five minute talk explaining what exactly what to eat 'em how to formulate your food in your meals and it's filmed run my own kitchen\nUm again food university that TV check it out you'll love it so fish oils smoothies in this many recipes right from the University of TV uh avocados um are very very important reducing inflammation flaxseed oil and then there's something we call Kirk humidity to mark\nI'm not sure if you're familiar with that it's like an Indian spice um it's very very amazing it's actually one of the number one sellers of our supplement it was on her office I'm\nAt a well help centers is we have one called ... and basically what it is is it's Kirk human tumor acute kinda the same thing and um what they do is a very very anti inflammatory people to take it wind up in particular have arthritis pain it will help to remove that in their joints um ... no good and you do not on it\nUm so I Love it I'm going to give a quick story here I'm of course one of our patients who came in the office to pick up I went to pick on Jimmy um he's ... he's a ... he's been in a couple of stories reviews on the Jimmy somebody they came in um he lives up in a scene lives up in a cafe and I believe\nSo Jimmy got a real big Lafayette accent and I'm just an amazing guy just a great guy hurt us on the radio and ... it was just he was on blood pressure medication um he wasn't feeling well\nAnd he's feeling older than he should got grandkids will pick up the grand kids you know didn't have that energy I'm against blood pressure medication pain and yet he ... her me on the radio very skeptical didn't call for a couple of weeks he came in or wouldn't humidity office\nFirst thing we need to be shops that have X rays I can see exactly it turns out that he actually at a pinch nerves yet old whiplash she's a football player\nAnd um yeah the ... nerve going directly to his heart so Jimmy there's your problem right there I think I can help number one your blood pressure better but number two as I can help your headaches and he said yeah but what about this uh the arthritis pain yet it in his in his fingers in his knees you know prompt us or we're going to work on\nNutrition so we we got him started on the you know food university that TV we had a couple of fitness challenges in the office which we're always doing something like that\nHe participated um 'course we shot and very short amount of exercise we are um of time of getting him adjusted changes lifestyle probably\nReally I'm Jimmy honestly is about six weeks or six weeks or shot as X rays are you actually is a fantastic so Jimmy how you do and he said listen man if I had just got to tell you ms reevaluate never say that I got to tell him and I'm so take a pay\nHe said I went to my medical doctor and medical doctor said hey Jimmy Boy your uh your um your numbers are looking great I think that we need to probably start decreasing you off of your blood pressure medication and Jimmy he's describing is losing out to be the best part is that I hadn't been taking my blood pressure medication for about four weeks\nTo stop taking medication as a medical doctor who was telling them that he's doing so good he needs to needs to stop taking medication which he already had\nIn the best part is he's changing his diet uh he lost about Fifteen twenty pounds I'm even to that point you've been about six weeks she says my arthritis pain gone my headaches are gone he says I feel like a million bucks Jimmy is probably one of our best advocates in the office he's always refer people in\nIt's and omega three versus omega ... a six shift\nWhich basically means too much omega six so making six again is grain and sugar was the big thing is spike or make six spike your information grain and sugar\nAnd most kind of put stress in that category um but it's tough to eliminate stress it's actually easier to eliminate the ... of the sugar so that way when you have stress um it doesn't affect your body so reactive we how do we avoid it real simple\nFish oils coconut ... know veggie oil no peanut oils and no grain fed beef or the grain fed beef will cause heart disease now because of the fat\nNow like the saturated fat causes heart disease because of inflammatory fat so cows that eat Green Bay won two twenty omega six uh omega three to make a sex ratio it's supposed to be one to through your wonder for cows that eat grass\nHow did they wander through your one before so great a grass fed beef is extremely healthy for you\nTo the same omega six ratio\nYou don't have to worry about the saturated fat as a matter of fact the saturated fat your brain needs that saturated fat your hormones either saturated fat as a matter of fact the old adage that saturated fat is bad for you to actually stupid because all of your neurons are made of saturated fat\nI mean God gave you saturated fat because he needs you to eat it and it's in you know a lot of very very healthy food uh now grain fed beef will cause heart disease not because of the saturated fat but because of the inflammatory fat of grain fed beef so\nHow do we remove information if you have against fish oil we recommend ... there's a brand called Carlton called liver oil we have another\nCouple of the brain that we sell her office at well health centers dot com\nUm and it really really good stuff again they're flavored so they don't taste like cod liver oil they're not super high ... uh uh sorry vitamin a which is uh something that can be harmful with your fish oils I'm also I'm smoothies if you haven't yet gone to food university that TV\nDoesn't the number one free resource that I can give you it's a it's a it's a website that I've created\nUm and it's a module one it's completely for free um it's about a forty five minute talk of the explaining exactly what to eat how to eat it\nUm how to

that helps you out there it's been a great show here I'm into recap that listen to it at one of the other things I Know that right now talking to people um that have\nReally gets stuck in this being unhealthy cycle and and I it's because there's so much information out there if you go on the Internet um if you if you're watching T. V. if you're you know on Facebook you're going to get inundated with every type of diet every type of supplement\nListen I Am not one that is super heavy and supplements that's for sure I think that

very important establish a retirement but you know I hate it when my wife\nSays eight let's talk about the budget [laughter]\nCongress to do that yeah they have a drum roll their\n[noise] All right so what we look at needs and wants so we all have to make sure that our needs are accomplishing retirement and Social Security usually helps with that and park or you have a secret sauce here when it comes to claiming the Social Security 'cause a lot of people that they don't claim the right option\nCould cost themselves about a hundred thousand dollars or so through retirement if they don't claim the right option and the officers are there right there four\nAnd a lot of people just don't realize you have more than one option when it comes to Social Security and you're right we seen it break down a hundred thousand dollar missed out money that you've paid any taxes your whole life\nSo if you can get more money that'll accomplish the needs and it'll get you into the want category but then the people that do the best of retirement are ones that are saved on their own and they put together their very own retirement plan that helps with\nOnce I Want to travel the world I Want to buy a plane I Want to do whatever the watts can be accomplished with extra money they're not going to get accomplished with Social Security oh of course always\nDirty maybe maybe hit an eighth yeah I Want three wishes and retirement [laughter]\nWhen they used to tell me you get three wishes you'd rather little jarring to go to ... was my first wish wish for a thousand more wishes\nAnd that was yeah that was another line we're never going to ask Robin Williams\nNever had one where there's so much so that was the retirement budget then number three income your new paycheck dependable income stream so we designed income streams that gets you more money do you ever imagine in retirement and again this three important components of a proper retirement plan and it has growth\nMaking sure your money's grow we do not using it but a lotta times Parker can grow when you're using it oh yeah All right so protection and income so you need to protect your money your taxes deflation and risk in an income is the most important part the vital part the terms of financial plan\nInto a true retirement plan if you don't have lifetime income streams built into your plan than your winter is lying to you if they tell you have a retirement plan do you agree with that part of one hundred percent you have a pre retirement plan [laughter]\nYeah I Know nothing nobody wants to pre anything they want a real retirement plan and they are entitled to that if they have money put aside folks matter of fact if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars saved for retirement we'll put together for you you're very oh financial in retirement plan now financial planning support but retirement plan and gives the Cadillac you need to make sure you have lifetime income\nSo if you have at least two hundred thousand and you're one of the next twenty people will call right now will custom designed for you an easy to understand financial and retirement review\nThat indicate if you're in need of a full blown retirement plan now keep in mind as always there's no obligation or cost for this additional review to all colors who have at least two hundred thousand dollar save for retirement now keep in mind or strategies work best for those have you with over ... billion but as long as you have two hundred dollars so we can get you on the past\nThe past you deserve to be on for retirement bliss\nNow if you meet these easy qualifications here's what you're going to get noticed a pretty good list we do even more than this one I'm going to touch on some of the highlights of what we can do for you not only will really help you with that Social Security claiming strategies but we'll do a forensic the analysis now this is very important because it'll help you untangle\nWhat it's costing to work with your current plan or or advisor even working on your own\nWe call these financial termites and our job is to help you identify them and exterminate them\nWe'll show you how you can protect your investments and keep more of your money and your accounts that's where it belongs into Puerto always it's your money you need to spend my money I Want to know [laughter]\nAll right so next to perform attacks analysis now you can't eliminate taxes completely but you can't eliminate bad claiming strategies that will get you more money instead of less money a lot of people not enacting\nThe proper ways to file their return and the government will not tell you if you over pay\nThey will tell you if you under\nLater though they may but if you get a phone call from somebody sound like an Irish they just hang up because the IRS would not call you they'll send you a better and we see a lot of these calls so don't do that so tax analysis is very important\nAnd then finally we're going to custom designed a lifetime and I mean your lifetime of your spouse's life time lifetime income plan that uses proven strategies and techniques\nThat good turbo charged retirement income

been changed and\nData changes a little bit but these are real numbers oh and if you want numbers like this for yourself of course your case was going to be different 'cause you probably have different wants nice desires and money\nBut you can at least see what could happen if you get a true planned again that retirement income planning that retirement planning process that we do every single day for people just like you're listening Parker let's go through what are you have this week\nSo I'm going to say because of the hurricane everything this past year Mr and Mrs Florence ... for

counting what he's contributing to now he worked at the same employer for close to twenty five years we're just looking at making sure that's protected growing and it's going to be his income stream in retirement\nSo he's fifty six she's fifty five and a half a million dollar saved let me ask you when you talk to and what was what were their main concerns when you invented do sit down and a vision of retirement with what what their goals and dreams of retirement with big\n... their main concerns where they have a lot of family across the country so they definitely want to go traveling

partners that can associate probably serving in Nashville community eight hundred sixty eight hundred sixty eight zero eight [noise]\nAnd we're back at America swirling facial I'm you save money correspondence tapes at all of course with me don't speak to Rhoda and the time is what's going to and Chris brought that we're all here so it's just a little research for the show today and I come up with a\nWith a story that pose the question what is twenty eight teams most popular financial goal now I mean you know you're going to say to them by four one K. or you know more of a retirement but you know what the number one answer was vacation vacation\nA little you know what I Know because that's\nNot always the best choice as much as I'd like to go on vacation I Know that's probably not going to happen for me to say well if we're retired and we want to go on vacations what do we need every year a paycheck when you\nGot it right or money coming in and so we designed plans and we build in we call it the fun box\nAnd so every year for our clients we dedicate a certain amount of money that comes in into the box to box of fun and basically you use that money to this either like you're doing ship your grandkids then\nYou have like the way that shit I'll grab your flyers [laughter] go on vacations right I mean there are the two fun thing over and over would ever go to flea market whatever you got to do something to go to yard sales every uh every Saturday and see what kind of bargain say goodbye and\nThen they end up on the show hoarders [laughter] how should that shows they want it is still good yeah horse so vacation is a is a ... a that's a great goal isn't it that was why they work hard all our life yeah I Want to go on vacation time as I Know what you want to do you want to travel around the world I think when you retire absolutely\nDo a lot too and it's no it's a big goal to conquer but I I we've talked about it every week on the show you you make those plans you learn how to do it and try to accomplish what you can't\nWear every now and then the study of little fear or these these ah surveys where they recommend when people retire and instead of going a nursing home to go on a cruise ship\nEvery year yeah because it's great healthcare great foods yeah I heard that [laughter] and uh I don't know but I mean that's what you know that's cheaper than a nursing home a lot of times a lot of nursing\nHomes are not cheap so we also have to plan for what could happen if we can't go on vacation right right that's the plant and no one wants to talk about that and we have a lot of procrastination that envelopes us when we start thinking about that and then we put things off\nAnd we don't do things like we should yeah and so we see it here in our in our studio in ... when people call in and they want to see us in the next couple of weeks\nAnd like the day before or the day oh they'll email saying something came up\nSomething is always going to come up and you're forcing it and if you're going to the doctor do you put that off no we are basically financial positions here we're going to make sure to number one tell ya if everything's fine or not and number two if not we're going to diagnose where we can do to fix you write and so\nMost of our job as financial planners is spent reassuring the worried well\nWell about that so putting it off because you're afraid of what might happen or don't understand is the worst thing you can do because we can help at first we educate\nI come from educational background my dad's college Mr mom a schoolteacher so I educate first that's what we did we educate and if during the education we see some things that that could be changed we recommend that signage prescription we'd go out and it's always and we're in a free country still luckily yes it's always up to you if you want to take our advice or not well\nRental I think that's important is that right yeah it's very easy as it is a disease that might be to be judgmental you're not yeah well no we don't know we just basically here's what you're happiest what I Would recommend if I were you most of the strategies I recommend I've already done myself so I'm working so\nYou know people will call saying well I got a statement that says this and I said yeah I got the same state but last week later in the same boat with you right course ... and uh you know we we basically if you do well we do well or\nYou know if you don't we don't have that all benefit of a new sheriff who you don't do well on my side I Know and that's the most important thing and there's so many other people that say hey that looks dangerous you go first talking about you and your advisor goes the other way\nSo we need to be very careful on that so vacations became number one that beat up paying off\nCredit card debt that was secular Syria is a vacation built up more credit cards [laughter] and and then improve my credit score was number three in order to help or no we're going to do that saving up for a vacation [laughter]\nDo they talk about the debt snowball and again if you're ... going up and and it's rolling down yeah\n[laughter] not good no that's a yellow snow right there\nIn the survey said that women were slightly more sensible than men when it came to that\nThey decided whether or not vacation was a good idea yeah I mean everybody's different too so I hate these surveys because I've never been surveyed editor I\nAnd maybe because they don't answer the phone but then again if you ask your survey my wife and me or my wife would be just the opposite she wants the patient right now so that's a financial talk or you got going on there and see who wins and that nobody nobody and then no matter who wins the other one's not happy about it you know you'd ride down the road on\nTo go pay some credit cards off 'cause you'd want to battle and you look over in the past year so your wife sitting there with arms crossed looking out the other side of the window looking at our fingernails you're in trouble\n[laughter] you are in trouble usually sides that well can I step Steve fingernails [laughter] because you want to go to the Bahamas [laughter] maybe next yeah\nSo it's it's just I mean it and again there's nothing wrong with taking a vacation but maybe\nInstead of taking a two week vacation take a five day vacation with my wife often jokes that about three days in a vacation I'm ready to come home anyway so\nMany vacations or steak actions have fun at home go out to eat cater some food and do things like that God I don't have to\nYou it's not that much fun by the way to go into the airport [laughter] ... that's the first part in the last part of the vacation by the late ... oh yeah coming back going there it you know on the way there doesn't seem as bad 'cause you're all happy about the vacation on the way back is this horrible especially if you go through Miami by the way that an alpha comeback high because our but yeah\nIt is a so again planning it properly very important sure\nAnd and and seeing if you can't afford it don't put things on credit cards unless you have a really good credit card a really good way to pay the credit card off and\nI'm getting my daughter who's twelve I'm going to get her a prepaid debit card that has like fifty dollars on oh God yeah yeah and so she can't charge more than fifty dollars but you could make a paid off you'll have to work at home and not pay it off or do you go and that's not a bad idea and so\nA lot of people we forgot about this pre paid debit cards yeah not a debit card trick connected to your bank account by the way the worst thing you do is is that you have it connected to your bank account or co sign on to the dose on it but but put fifty bucks into their credit card you just send the check to the credit card companies and then you pay the bill off\nEach would just like a regular credit card so your your debit ballots days if you still have fifty dollars into account basically short dollars as collateral you put more in it but I Do probably fifty maybe a hundred dollars but it's something good for them to get their arms around and make sure that they understand why when they spend money is not there anymore\nYeah then yeah well I Love the idea of the debit card to have to try to track those line items and quite frankly it gives them the opportunity to modernize and maybe purchase something for my tunes are an app store or something like that\nMaybe it's just me because I'm getting grouchy as I get older if these fifty one now but I remember when we were little my grandpa and this was a little meaning like eight years old little coach the days\nWhen my grandparents will give us a five dollar gift certificate booklet from McDonalds oh I remember there's yeah I have two little brothers and we would all take ... take you to say let's go to McDonalds so we'll leave all she said take one of your coupons out so we'd all tear one dollar out of our book let's just go to McDonalds\nAnd we leave with a full belly an ice cream go off and then\nAnd we need to do some we're going to do we are working on a series called the history of money and this will be included by the way\nThe minutes fast food restaurant started accepting credit cards what happened to the prices there when I jumped didn't they just go up or they wouldn't like crazy to go back a Google McDonald menu from seventies and sea level or at twenty five cents or twenty cents like that but as soon as they started taking credit cards\nNot like a not one was like you see on the office either nobody [laughter] finding out what you want to do and then being reasonable with your decisions going forward you're not telling you have to do too much and not telling you you shouldn't do too little basically putting guide guardrail simply there you go yeah guiding you\nOr I as we go in that journey the financial journey it's it's again wife is a journey not a destination ... at once we get to the destination it really does matter anywhere\nElse I think you know you recognize what do you recommend a potential clients put a budget together do it for thirty days no you don't care where every dime goes a personal death but that's more for the client to say oh my gosh this is where my money is going this is how I'm spending ... this is how I can save more if that part that you've taken and put to work\nFor I had somebody long time ago basically he had he hit every third going out to eat receipt because [laughter] I was at lunch time for him and the wife was making them watch\nOut\nSo he looked at me and it's like little sweat was coming down as well and I didn't say that that's not my place there and you know any police officer tell you they don't want to respond to domestic argument we our financial\nReferees many times is to try to work the two sides out because there is a financial took a war going on between what you want to do and what your spouse wants to do many gas to get in common ground has started sound like a politician our I\nMean they're not going to do anything [laughter] kick the can down the road there is none [laughter] why\nPeople are how people get in trouble as they they think or they don't make a budget because they they don't want to write everything down right well if you take one credit card if you have one credit card for the household and you put everything on the credit card if it's going to end again don't\nOvercharge cars going to pay it off it in a month yeah let all your expenses around there Yeah Yup one great guy now you've got a financial planner you get the spending plan yeah and it based on that spending plan we can build a financial plan here's what you're spending and then we average it over twelve months\nSo you may have a a month where you really just Benjamin you really see how they like march\nNew Year's resolutions disappear yet you say that I'm going out to eat [laughter] but we average amount over twelve months here's what's your average monthly spending ... and the best thing is over a couple of years we've looked at its ongoing process yeah he might have increased expenses okay well that's what we build emergency counts for that so it doesn't have to be really should be your best friend would put a spending plan together\nAll of that goes on going through that exact same thing with my budget right now just making sure my twenty eight teams ready to go and and what you're saying it's so true that ah it's less about getting the budget ready it's more about the the the stress and the worry this leaving Nita knowing that I at least have a reasonable understanding what's going\nOn and this is not just for folks that that are lower income this was proud of millions of dollars we are just so so what I recommend most of the times the wife gets their own credit card and a husband get sort of his own they share the information that way you can see what the spending is there you go and it's not meant to get mad at each other's just meant to see what your true spending it yeah it was for real yeah they get so first thing to do\nIs for the wife to open up a great present for your birthday and you find out your wife charge it on the credit cards that you're\nBoth [laughter] I don't know really it's just I mean that's about I don't know what you've gone has to do with anything but [laughter] you can't\nGo when you got to be has to know but it's just about putting you know being logical Steve and getting the right order and we do this in our financial final four and what we do in again well I think we should offer this as we leave for the week\nFor the next twenty five callers to call in right now we will put together for you you're very young financial final for now it's based on your financial situation you're shared goals\nExamine all the various financial tools and options available in the financial arena today because we're for new series and based on her for ... review\nWe'll give you a four choices that we think make the most sense for you and we highlight the one that makes the best sense and we put together a one page financial plan for you based on that one that makes sense but\nWe don't say hey this is the only choice pay no attention to the man behind the curtain we show you the Ford top choices that exist today known to man that makes sense\nNow because there's everybody out there trying to push one thing or the other let's show you what's really available out there what show you what really fits what you're looking for and what's disclosed every single thing in these plans and again or produce Uri objectives or to put you\nAhead of the curve on this your needs to be taking care of before anybody and that's the most important thing and so we go through the tactical management aspects you know what what protect management mean to you in the future what could Ross conversion strategies mean for you which is we talked about that in the show\nCould you have a systematic transfer of IRAs into life insurance accumulation products that could make sense\nThat

here for our health there is a solution I might have made it sound a gloom and doom but there is a solution and it's um\nIt's actually getting you healthy through nutrition and it's done in my office all the time\nAll right so we were talking we're going to talk about children and how the diet\nA healthy diet can reduce violence and rudeness and increase your child's IQ but before we do that I just wanted to read you a tax uh you know I get a lot of children in my office and uh it it when they turn around children turn around with nutrition really really fast almost in front of you\nBut this is a a young gentleman he came in I think he was at the at this time he was about seven or eight years old he was having a hard time in school he couldn't concentrate I Believe it was the teacher that said he needed to be put on medication the mother didn't want to put him on medication\nUm she didn't even take them to a medical doctor she was a patient of mine she brought him and to me\nAnd what we found with him was and what I find with a lot of children it's the pituitary gland the master Glenn that small little Glenn that's in the middle of the brain\nAnd it runs the hormone system it runs the digestive system and when it's not working right these young people ah they lose focus they can't concentrate they can't think properly hazard as it started to develop\nWell this was the case with this young man and he was on the program for maybe a month maybe a little longer than a month\nBut this is a tax that his mother sent me on a weekend\nAnd it just says good morning Dr Foley an update on Justin he made an a and B grades on his school progress report he has always made season ... and F grades\nHe said the doctor has fixed him he was so proud and happy of his grades well that's fantastic and and that happens all the time or you know you don't have to really medicate these children a matter of fact I've ... I've never seen\nI mean it may appear that they're doing well but I've never seen where to actually fix the problem that's why they're on these medications year after year after year you put a child on medication\nAnd it's going to affect them somewhere along his lifetime and most of them when they become teenagers are able to uh uh out from under the parents are guidance of don't take themselves off the medication\nAnd matter of fact you put your child on medication for say ADHD or that's considered a mental a a mental issue a mental illness and they can no longer joined the service so you gotta watch out what you're doing\nWhen you're handling these children one thing you can do and this is what we are going to talk about and I got several studies here are on how to um how to change your child's a diet here and they've done several studies here and it's very interesting that's why I brought this in\nA food messes with ah with the child's emotions um\nFood that can also influenced their behavior and it does according to cutting edge research eating a healthy diet affects much more than just your weight and help it has been linked to decrease in violence and that's a decrease in violence rudeness antisocial behavior and an increase in\nIQ test scores and great among children\nAnd like I say set and that's exactly true that I just read you the uh the tax and that ... that actually shows it\nNow there was a some studies done and prior to Nineteen Ninety seven the central alternative high school in Appleton, Wisconsin used to be filled with troublemakers kids carrying weapons police officers patrolling the halls school counselor\nGreg I'm Beth Beth Beth\nTurn down a job there saying I found the students to be rude obnoxious and ill mannered\nMannered the school then in ... implemented a healthy food program one that added fresh fruits vegetables a salad bar whole grain breads to the cafeteria and blew up hamburgers fries and replacing vending machines with water ... coolers yes our um\nLast I'm Michelle Obama when she went in and change the school she put in she couldn't put in anything worse uh and that was a diet Cokes she put in diet Cokes in these machines there but in this cut in this case the school replace everything or in the machines with a water\nBy two thousand to another started in Nineteen Ninety seven by two thousand to one teacher a merry said I don't have to deal with daily discipline issues I don't have disruptions in the class or difficulties with students behavior I experienced ... as I experienced before we started\nThe food program one student uh asserted now I can\nConcentrate I can think it's easier I think it's easier to get along with people\nSince Nineteen Ninety seven in the school has reported no drop outs ... know or expelled student students with drugs or weapons no students with drugs or weapons and no students suicides\nOr the school principal was understandably impressed\nI Can't buy the argument that it's too costly for schools to provide good nutrition for their students I have found that one one costs will reduce another I don't have the vandalism I don't have the litter and I don't have the need for high security\nSo that's one school now that was between Nineteen Ninety seven and two thousand two where they went in and they changed the or food or the food and the children changed to a drastically overtime\nSo that's just one one study that they did on these children and that was in a less Appleton, Wisconsin that they changed them around you know when I went to school you actually had true food you had a cafeteria Mrs fetish field was actually are cook\nAnd uh and my elementary and when you got to work in in with all the food you got you got your a lunch free", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Mandis", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "21"}
