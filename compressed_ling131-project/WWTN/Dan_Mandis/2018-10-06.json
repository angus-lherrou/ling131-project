right but I seriously doubt\nUm that doesn't mean they're bad people that doesn't mean they're not on your side that doesn't mean they are um that means there that doesn't mean they're bad agents but they represent the interests of\nThe builder and the community and not a view the buyer ... they are that is their job is to make sure that their their client the builder gets the best deal and the best terms in the best pricing and all of those things and as a buyer's agents my responsibility to come in and say hey we can back down on this we can back down on those types of things\nFrom experience I Know we can get these these couple of things done let's ask for\nSure yeah that's all right if you're just not tune in and you're listening to the tiny ask about real estate show in Studio with me as Jackie with air like mortgage and Chris with teen wealth and real estate agent and we're going over\nFive reasons or five things that you need to know about when you're on purchasing new construction we've got protection the right questions to ask questions on when it comes to the process and also\nAnd knowing that your cells agent if you just go straight to the\nCommunity they're representing their best interest of the builder and that's why calling credits you how to negotiate on your behalf can get you some of those things that maybe you didn't even know you could get an experience and being in the industry okay and our number for what's in before\nOne of the one of the bars agents biggest jobs throughout the entire process is controlling fear and setting\nUm as professionals with experience we know what to expect regarding time frames permitting a certificate of uh of occupation\nAh inspections and the progression of events\nOr we'll go through the contracts how how the exact wording of each individual builders contracts is and what to expect in terms of that\nIn ... one of the biggest things that I've come across with a new construction buyers ... is they don't want to do a home inspection they think that it's a brand new home and I don't need to look any further than what I can see with my own eyes\nAnd I completely disagree with that with that aspect you called them you called her miss earlier and I would say that it's a myth that you don't need an inspection on a new construction\nBecause that's when you find the big ticket items that is when you find the uh the missing insulation or the a wrong direction plumbing or the backwards faucets or you know all of these little things that are not thinking that nobody thinks of but that inspector can go in and say hey these things wrong we need to get these things corrected\nUh one of the largest I this was in a quiet of mine at somebody in our office ... but one of the largest um\nInspection or or one of the largest inspection finds that they ever had was on a new construction it was at one point two million dollar home and the main structural beam along the bottom of the house cracked and they would have never known that had they not had a ...\nAnd they had all that shifting over time right above the law that is huge very good point alright what's our finals that's ... that's reasonable\nYou alluded to before ... um is they've already got a built in to their pricing that the that their buyer has a ... and so we don't cost anything mhm uh to the buyer of builders already has a those commissions and their pricing model and some builders even have it a listed as a marketing expense so they expect\nBuyers to have agents with them or they also honestly kind of like it because it gives another layer of communication from builder\nTo sales agent to buying agent down as a buyer somebody else who can either translate indoor um ease the blow of something that

tell our listeners just a little bit and about some success stories you've had with your client\nSure um we had one of you out you also ask who is the happiest and I would definitely say it was our ... and uh they're wonderful couple they just moved to the area from Mississippi or have a beautiful little baby and just a cool young couple that he got a great job and Dixon and they wanted to\nWonderful house and we found them one and Jackie did a great job on the on the mortgage side and I wouldn't have been around so I had a vacation starting the very next day and we went up to Dixon and I live in Wilson county mind you drove to Dixon\nAnd we looked at four different houses and they picked one loved it wrote the ... in the driveway\nAnd headed accepted before I got home\nWhile that's awesome we were in a row now I Do I Do want to say that it's like sometimes and I'm like talking to clients and they're like I've seen thirty homes on my in the back of my mind going to have their own real estate\nHow do you know your age is there a friend of a friend\nAnd I'm like oh yeah that's it but now that that speaks volume on and the type of an age of that you are when assessing your clients needs\nAnd not just throwing a bunch of houses out there like really that shows that your orientation process and really trying to learn what that buyers looking for is amazing to show them for houses right an offer the driveway and have it back in your in your email by the time you get home absolutely\nOne of the one of the great ways or one of the techniques that I'm employed to help that along\nWas to shoot a video of the couple outside of this house and they said oh we love your home we'd love to make it ours we're going to do this with the bedroom at please accept or offer and the sellers absolutely loved them they will but yeah they\nHad in ... they said we thought we felt like we were best friends and we just wanted to sell it to him because we're not moving far away

it's I couldn't make it to the closing but so it was nice to actually put a face of the first time I've been calling every single week or talking to her everyday but that was another quick one also you had them on their contracts like right away and and I talked to them\nThe funny thing is is that the couple I hadn't met with a year prior and they could not get qualified and they called me back and they said we think we can get qualified now let's check it out and we did we called you got qualified and within a week and a half we were we were under contract and they had a house mhm\nWow congratulations guys that's another story so there is something I'm I've talked to um my listeners before and it was talking to you guys too but on this last Thursday we had um\nA marketing council which is the home builders association in middle Tennessee\nAnd we focus on talking about um selling to generations because when I grew up in within my training and a lot of it had to do with personalities like this profiling and we called it the ... tiger and you know how to how to communicate\nTo the different personalities riots but now it's not only just different personality types\nUm and doing this um seminar on last week on Thursday\nThere's literally five generations that are buying in today's market and you're going all the way from you know baby boomer plus\nThat is a totally different wants to be has different concerns has different cares has different needs wants to be communicated differently than you do generation y or generation X. that's out there buying so as as we are seeing kind of this melts\nGather what do you feel like one of the articles that I saw that we were talking about is that really the millennials are gonna be they are the biggest part of our home by mark at your they're just so long or cycle to buy and why do you think that is why do you think millennials are waiting longer\nAnd and it's just like paying rent for ten years ago and all of a sudden I'm going to buy a house they have higher expectations okay say of higher\nExpectations of what they want they're not willing to settle so to speak because the ... there are generations before that all they want us to do is get out of mom and dad's house that was their\nGoal scene and the goal was to\nGet to get out of the house to get out of the uh the zone of control if you will and be out on their own and make it for themselves\nAnd the millennial generation there's it's not wrong it's not\nUm it's not bad how they are thinking it's just a different way of thinking so they are have been trained that age that the homeless nose on a safety and they can stay there until they get something that meets their expectations going forward in life so the millennials in my experience have\nHas been um fewer further in between as far as\nPercentage wise how many are buying but they also start with larger and larger homes because they have the higher expectations mhm they have the higher expectation of quality\nMhm that's a very good point or like a and Jackie you are a millennial and and thank you for helping me sales and marketing counsel last\nEncourage thank you for helping me to you guys so proud to be a millennial are you guys had a stage where you 'cause 'cause people about it right [laughter] yeah yeah you really don't and straighten it out it's because you\nOnly have ... now so let's talk about\nOn that and I'm Glad that we talked about a thousand marketing is you've bought and why like you know the value and how much equity and ...\nHe was having trouble I think [laughter] I Know really hurt us and let me get my hands\nAnd when are you going to get married and have children and we've got\nA half the reason that it also I see their parents they bought together we're not getting married and how much later in life so all of a single and those are renting mhm\nMhm so do we see anything in the near future\n[noise] [laughter] no but you know\nNot

why are we looking to build a log cabin and I'm Wondering what if there's a lot of ...\nWhy I have a far cry why\nNot a [noise] it's not a big difference I mean is it does cost a little more but when you do log cabins you know is it all all of them are going to be she rock on the inside walls to or anything like two by fours\nAnd what they owe the ex Jerry Walls and got all the air while they well they look at what a what oh\nYeah yeah so basically you're the only difference is you're exterior walls and a lot of times you're loggers I mean the the guys who build it or if you're going to they pre drill a hole so you had them cut the boxes in in you know you laid out to co they should know been electrician come and mark on the floor and then they can pre drill\nSo the holes already there for him to run the up and over and you know you could put the plugs in you have a choice you could do plugs in a base board or you can do in the laws are also floor boxes you can do floor but if you ask me let's just pick let's say it was a two thousand square foot house versus a two thousand square foot log cabin\nIn the kitchen is not on the outside wall that's where it costs more but I Would say the cost of your friends you might spend the extra thousand Fifteen hundred dollars but the kitchen on the external\nOkay I thought that\nYou know it's like I said the same kind of why everything's the same it's just when you get all\nThat well if\nYou if you do that your your walls and everything is a little more but since you said she was six years in a game but you can make it you can do based for plugs and not have to do this stuff in the long you know the switches is where you have to ... because we got to go up so you don't want to you want the loggers to pre drilled

address for Dr electric here it is the our electric tea and\nEdgy mailed odd comedy our electric tea and edgy male dot com this one from ... to quote\nTo install a new circuit with three wall plugs this will be in a ... office that I have in Brentwood\nI'm most it's Brentwood ... MC wires probably jumped stealing three book you can but\nSeen it and I would say figure three hundred and twenty five dollars was parts of labor right and it's pretty I mean people ... that way\nIt's hard to see what it means three plugs in ... imagine offices and bigger than what we're in right here in Studio and then we're going to have you know probably two and a half hours and some wire but yeah and it should work and usually we\nCome out until you anyways when we're there would have cost but if a number of just a budget number three twenty five you should be pretty good\nAll right let's try this one from Kevin I bought an electric plug that has a U. S. B. charging built in where I'd like to install it already has a G. F. C. I. outlet can I Move the G ... guy to another outlet that is already protecting orders that mess anything up\nUm bugs your if you ... you did you say he bought a G is the island with a USB port\nYeah ... was a bottle electric plug that has a USB okay charging built in\nUm if you're plugged you're supposed to be protected than you don't want to just throw a plug in there in France not protected they do silly gee if I were the USB port so you can change that but there's no use and moving and you can yes you can move a G is\nIf the Irish have to go to another plug that's already protected if you want to use just that that plug is Eighteen dollars when you replace in like two dollars so yeah you don't have to\nYou can savings or you know news is somewhere else but you know it's not illegal to have to justify is on the same circuit but you just have you know basically forty dollar sitting there set of four\nIn the wall but um they do have a gee if I were a USB port also\nAll right if you have not heard this I'm going to save you if you have a crawl space under your house potentially\nFive hundred to as much as maybe four thousand dollars there about and you think I Want to sell you something like oh we go do something underneath your crawl space or something like that no\nThis is something that you are entitled to have should already have and if it's worn out it could cost you that much\nAnd it's called a farm and shield and ... and I tried to tell the folks what is that why would you care what's the deal and what what's been your experience you\nKnow it's funny you should say that 'cause this week\nAll oh here we go another one [laughter] I Love it my guys come and\nTell them they there was a cat data a cat had gotten into this apartment shield and so they're in there and we're replacing the duct work I mean it was is probably four or five hundred dollar repair and out they were pulling the duck out and all of a sudden this cat comes running out and scare them both\n[laughter]\n... you're not used to and the more you know I'm not expecting it could've been a mountain lion charging ... you know yeah but\nYeah the the flashing wasn't installed properly on the unit and a cat a tunnel underneath there and got into the duct work and it was just he was living in there I guess or they didn't the owners didn't know the cats all ... had the cat torn in to the to the flexible ... had excellent torn in their ... ... ... out of it\nAll right so was there because it was so hot outside and they're all this cat out a little bit air conditioning he was just trying to get go so here's the thing if you do have the crawl space yeah environments shield is supposed to be nice if improperly salsa install so what did they not do\nOr could you tell the folks cause I talked about this a little bit earlier today\nThis panel change business you know um because you've said on the show\nIn most cases when somebody calls you saying hey I Need a new panel or I've had somebody come over here and give me a estimate for a new panel in most cases not necessary and somebody could be spending anywhere from twelve hundred to twenty four hundred dollars and not need to do that\nUm yeah most of the time and believe it or not to see a sneak a he's not um per se Jerry what are the companies that homeowners you probably don't need a pound changed when they want to add a unit well uh we get that and then home inspector sometimes say to them because they see an old panel\nOr they're not used to seeing what it looks like but I'm ... and less your breaker and you don't you're not going to notice if you're if you're going to buy a house and you think he's about to change but\nIf your main breakers always kicking\nEither there's two things you wrote outgrown your house we have a bad my record but if you you know if you turn on the stove and the AC in the wintertime and\nChristmas lights on that main kicks all the time and we we can test that main if it if it's a hundred ... up and you're pulling a hundred and ten ... and you know you go yeah we you outgrown the house and then we just up the service but a lot of times man homeowners count on the breakers in her pounding the Adam together\nSo if they have a hundred two hundred in Maine and they had all these breakers when it comes to twenty over over it doesn't work like that comes up is two hours and there but uh\nMost of the times you're not pull and a half of what your main is meaning and it sounds fun will say that a lot of times I went to a pound the other day matter of fact\nIt was a hundred and fifty and panel they want to know if they had enough we put a sixty and they want to change it to a Ninety they didn't know if they had enough power so I ... in front of them in a commercial building matter of fact it's a studio that they do to Kelly picture show out of\n... and uh they were pulling for ... for for for [laughter]\nOr they they're like we were were full of I Know you know and all the ... then it was empty there was only for there were seven breakers hooked up and only two are being you know\n... what would only pull for ...\nIsn't nothing nothing I mean I like the exhaust fan in the bathroom and you know somebody lights on just make up ... probably on that I didn't I don't know what's on the pounds just let them\nJacket but it's funny my how I got ... house in a pool I Am mine once it was forty apps yeah so it's ... that's when the electricity comes in but most times people tell him to change and a lot of the homo Specter's now once they get to these new codes\nAnd read them and see what changes like a nigger a for instance I'll just give you a small little sample in a garage brand new houses now you got to have a\nDedicated twenty and circuit in the garage for implode okay you can still have Fifteen but the you have to have at least one twenty and that's the new code in a new code yeah just one of the little goes\nBut you know when so when these inspectors go nice houses don't be afraid when they write down ... because it is only for brand new house brand new now writer run there's a lot more than that is just one day we'll go over more it's just\nYour bring that coach it and sometimes I hear that it's like oh she's a big book yeah [laughter] but I mean the most stuff you've got to do you know oh yeah yeah mine were\nYou know the home stuff is just a you know the the thing for homeowners is going to be like the ... the washing machine or\nThe washers going to be our fault if I'm protected so basically when you hear no a lot of the houses will be the like the whole living room will be are also they're telling them use uh gee if I combo breaker because it's cheaper and us I plug the problem is\nWhen you hear calls I have my house I plug don't work\nNo big deal delivering still on the outside plug don't work they can live with that the changes and electricians ... breakers when if that gee if I kicks for being outside for rain now their whole living room we down yeah there you go there that isn't going to be hey miles up blood is going to be here my living rooms down yeah you say a couple of hours what\nYeah right who was closer than sooner now with the stars void\nThere would be a lot more homeowners get mad because there were breakers are going to kick for nothing major rungs thing read whatever ... today is going to kick your living room now now you know in the problem is when we say I'll be there sometime after lunch no problems outside plug we don't use it but when MTVs off into computers off as a whole\nBig

what you need to prove meals and entertainment 'cause I can honestly say many of my clients walk in and the first thing they basically do they say well here's my meals in entertainment\nBut the question is in order to duck the expense for business meals there are a few things that must be documentary seats with the name of the person for whom you met\nWith a few words about the business discussion\nYou know let's just say I'm a real estate person\nAnd so I took out a clients and the discussion was possible properties for sale possibilities to close\nA possibly wanting to lift their home that would be just you know if not a kept the individual receipts keep a calendar with the following information the amount of the expense of the day time and place of the expense the purpose for the expense and the person whom you met\nI find that to be almost more worthwhile than actually the receipts because theoretically anything less than Seventy five dollars we don't have\nTo have the receipt for but they can still ask us to prove or justify what we were doing at those meetings even if we have them\nSo just keep in mind that even if you don't have the receipt in this particular case there's still a deduction allowed but you must document again the the amount of the expense the daytime and place the purpose and the name of whom you you met with\nA so we'll take it from there All right let's go to the phones real quick for the first break family what's happening\nHey how's it going I'm Linda wildlife my love\nOr um uh my wife and our starting a up the truck business and we have been entertaining some boat I'm bringing 'em over letting them drought or do we are going to start on a truck that we get the camp that all that and the fans are no\nWell the question is going to be is are these people are were you just kind of making sure you had taste testers I mean in the ... you know that yes so the cost of the food would be\nTheoretically I guess you consider that a you know marketing because you're trying to figure out what you were going to make er or costs of goods are but I see as far as any cost them staying with you or travel or any of that oh no no no okay just the food costs yes I don't see any problem with that I think you could justify that\nUm again you're going to want to document you know the dates that you had these food testing and and that kind of thing which should tire relatively close to the days that you went\nTo buy the food right or or made it through to whatever I'm there than it is that's it a three sided thanks very much\nNo worries steaks that's all right again we are live in Studio I'm Dr friday and if you have a question it's too hard to pick\nUp the phone six one five seven three seven nine nine eight six six one five seven

planner which goodness gracious I Hope many of you are\nWe're getting to the last quarter you need to be doing some evaluations you need to be looking at your W. twos you need to be figuring out is is or is this not going to be the time that you maybe need to accelerate a little bit more into your retirement to keep us in that twelve percent\nI mean it used to be Fifteen to twenty right now it's twelve to twenty two huge jump between the two tax brackets we really need to maximize this much we can into that twelve percent so we're gonna talk about some ways that you can do that\nUm and hopefully a put a little bit more money in your pocket possibly more into your retirement whichever way makes it easier for you to be able to move forward on that All right so let's take a break and

hey Dan nice for calling\nHer doctor friday I Am self employed at my own business and I go out of town from time to go get him or herself or just trying to find out what general or from as far as to what expenses are deductible as far as ... you know obviously in this and that they're on my lecture just trying to get your\nGuidance on that and I'll hang up and looking for your response\nThank you okay great I'm under the new tax law you're going to probably fit under business travel\nUm as long as there is no entertainment involves so as long as you're not going out to the bar and eating dinner or something where his shows there could be live entertainment of some sort but if you just stopping and and doing those that meals um would be fifty percent deductible which is pretty much standard\nTo what we had in the place before so um if you're traveling to go buy inventory and you're having to go to another state pick it up and then come back lodging if you're driving mileage\nAnd meals would all be deductible I'm a fifty percent of the meals would still be deductible in that scenario so I'm just again make sure you keep note saying why did you go to tower what was the purpose of the the meeting or what was the purpose of going out of town and the expense how much did you spend because\nYou know a lot of times people use their credit cards and so at the end the year they add up all the meals 'cause they say only meals I put on this credit card was for business well that's\nGreat but you know and again if it's less than Seventy five dollars theoretically we don't have to justify the receipt of it but they can still require your calendar that shows why where when and how to that receipts so it's very very important to either write it on it and scanned those in or keep a calendar that Dick documents\nWhat happens is sometimes you forget to claim something in this one case she forgot a W to was it like a thousand dollars they disallowed all kinds of other things
