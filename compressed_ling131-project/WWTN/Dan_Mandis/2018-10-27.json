that I I Will tell you there's a lot of people out there that um when you have a these little valleys that that trade off into a a small gutter and then have a doubt that on to most likely that first story route you don't pay attention to those I just had a I\nJust had to charge somebody quite a bit of money to big three corners because my daughter got it might get replaced the gutters and when they went to put new ones up there wasn't no meat yep yep\nAnd uh we go to an all time yeah and also I mean you've got to\nYeah you got to pay attention and make sure you know that's what that you're

other thing too about that is that everybody says I Can't tell you how many times I've heard it well I don't have any trees around my house there is no way my gutters are claw\nAnd [laughter] and and and the other thing is people don't realize it only takes about five leads to clog up that down about to slow the drain down there and once that water backs up dude it's just back up and say anything with it\nBut you know what you can do to help so that if you do have a lot of leaves and you don't get the strange the helmets and some sometimes it works sometimes they don't I've seen about seeing

around the water gets hot enough you'll still fall into it\nUntil it gets a so called that the gutters completely called all the way the top end there's no doubt about that but clean all that right but you can we get some ... without without without five leaves going over that whole route there and then nothing leaving\nYou know as you asked filling up to it over ... ...\nWell that's right and

All right so next thing I Want to talk about and we talked about\nThe company the integrity of the company hands on you don't find that a lot and and new construction right now especially model and most of your busy over ... ... you guys are building at a price point that is almost like a custom home like you're building it custom to that client\nUm and so that's what's really awesome because most people think oh if I got to do custom home I got to go spend a million dollars somewhere that's not the case\nUm and the promotions that you guys do\nThe care that you put into the product is amazing you've shared a little bit about the lifestyle I'm with clients you actually live in the neighborhoods so you must really love your home [laughter]\nPeople here on out there selling and and oh by my by by for my build or you you love that um and you know that the quality and stuff is there so I think there's a couple of things I wanted just to kind of as we're wrapping up the segment um\nYou mentioned that your demographics on can be from the empty nester to maybe the first time homebuyer so I Know I'm a lot of our listeners um have children they're usually a little bit of an upper age type probably more babies were type mhm I'm with a mix of everything else of course\nAnd one of the things that I was learning and just this year doing a lot with sales and marketing council is there's so many mess out there about buying a home\nIt could be a new construction I have to wait six months or nine months obviously that's not the case if you've been listening or just tuning in right now we have Fifteen move in ready homes Kathy can get them\nClosed in two weeks you can be and by Thanksgiving making your own turkey and at the latest if you will you know an advantage Christmas Eve or anything [laughter]\nDo you think giving didn't come and cook it myself [laughter]\nSo that's awesome so that is a myth out there 'cause a lot of times when our clients call in and they want to get pre approved and our listeners are talking about well I really don't want to wait or my children want to buy this home\nIf you buy an older home I'm not saying by an old home as bad it's just you don't have to warn ... so I Want to talk a little bit about before we go to break water ... what are the true advantages and buying new construction over resell\n[noise] and I think it starts with the ... I think if you start\nWith we have a minute so you're going to have a one year builder warranty as what we have um we problem for homeowners and I'm at the end of that one year Matthew comes personally himself and he walks home with a homeowner I'm even most recently we had a homeowner I'm get a full\nHomosexual important then again just for their own peace of mind\nAnd they couldn't hardly find anything you know just your typical male pops and that's a year later it yeah and that's a whole year later and that Matthew definitely comes out and he he walk everything and we even had the same at home when I go you know there's there's nothing on us are really care about and Matthew saw a couple of things that\nHe said you know I I'm just going to go ahead and take care of it for you anyway so um I Know that it's not something that bothers you I'm just I'm going to do it ... because that's he wants people to be happy if he wants them to know that we're going to go above and beyond to make sure that they stay happy in their home yeah\nWell there's a most other real are split on do you do but they hope but year passes weekly here we're over there so that I got a call ... ... that's the ... because ...\nAnd and I think that um I mean some people depending on area wise where they want to build a that's why I said I'm not saying resell is bad it's just you really need to understand the benefits of new construction and especially if you don't have to wait and there's move in ready homes right now that's the key um but you know I've had some some clients that just wanted to be in this little\nCool little area and\nAnd within a year I had to replace their conditioning that's forty five hundred five thousand dollars or their dishwasher goes out or they'll crawl space has stuff in it that maybe the home inspector didn't catch what the time but now they've got to do that just ...\nLike clean out that calls face I have you ever seen those bits like if you get um what is it called ... and it's like on a very small let's say maybe a twelve hundred square foot home I got a dead one time for someone\nIt was over four thousand dollars and ... and so there's just there is some different advantages um\nYou know I'm ... naming some big items out there but\nWhat about dated cabinet dated countertop state exploring all of that so if you go in and do you think oh well if I buy this resell home it's two Seventy five versus my new construction homes three ten which many do you have to put into it\nAnd what what is going to be your benefits behind it like what if that acey goes out you know replacing kitchen cabinets and counter tops and depending on subcontractors to show up like that is where I feel like a lot of people jump into it I think I'm gonna get a fixer upper and that's their ideal thing and it ends up custom way more money than what they initially thought\nTo where new construction has some major advantages over that I ... in my opinion and and doing this for twenty two years while it's like\nUm if you want to compare a little bit um it's your it's like\nBuying a new car you know you buy a new car you drive up a lot and it's great it's great to go and now he's a male CEO it feels good ride with me or war in ...\nUm or sometimes you buy a used car and you walk into a whole bunch of problems that you never force on ... and it's absolutely I think that's comparable to home buying 'em you know my brother for instance he bought a house had a home infection dying\nAnd and they missed a lot that he bought it and as his condition he just wanted to know what he was heading into before he bought the house he bought the house starts remodeling it\nThinking he's only going to pit forty thousand dollars into it and they are ... hundred thousand dollars later and he's like and he still has a lot more to go and he's like I should have just for what happened to this house ashes botany ... and and I see that quite a bit actually\nIf you do so I kind of wanted to just the kind of talk about that because we see it every single day and people always think oh I'm going to go find that deal that the deal it's going to be a fixer upper\nAnd it's just it when you start pulling up that flooring tearing down those walls there's no telling what will fall grits are going to Liberia\nThere's only ... read that yeah so definitely\nI'm definitely a is it it's a it's a different mindset and so if it's your first home you know look at new construction\nIt's out there and that's available and get it the way you want it at the very beginning because when I got my first time I was working crazier more hours and I work now you know what I mean you're starting you're young you're in your career you're having to work more there's more demand you don't have time to go home to Tor House you know are going oh my gosh we had to go to Home Depot 'cause I got to repaint this or\nThis or that are ... to prevent that if

or why are we looking to build a log cabin and I'm Wondering what you are a lot of it\nAnd why I have a far cry why ... ... well\nNot a [noise] it's not a big difference I mean it it does cost a little more but when you do log cabins you know is it all all or is it gonna be she rock on the inside wall soup or anything like too much force\nIt on the way that they\nOwe the ex Jerry Walls ... an air while they well\nThey look at what a what oh yeah yeah\nSo basically you're the only difference is you're exterior walls and a lot of times you're loggers I mean the the guys who build it or if you're going to they pre drill a hole so you have them cut the buses in in you know you laid out to code they should know but in the winter should come and mark on the floor and then they can pre drill\nSo the whole already there for him to run the run up and over and the other choices you can put the plugs in you have a choice you can do plugs in a base board or you can do in the laws are also floor boxes you can do floor but if you asked me let's just big let's say it was a two thousand square foot house versus a two thousand square foot log cabin\nIn the kitchen is not on the outside wall that's where it costs more but I Would say the costs difference you must spend the extra thousand to Fifteen hundred dollars with the kitchen on the external\nOkay I\nKnow it it said the same kind of why everything's the same it's just when you log in a while you know if\nYou did that your your walls and everything is a little more but since you said she was six years in a game but you can

MC wires probably uh jumped stealing three but you can\nBut I've seen it and I would say figure three hundred and twenty five dollars was parts of labor right and it's pretty I mean people buying that way but\nIt's hard to see what it means three plugs in Austin um imagine offices and bigger than we're in right here in Studio and then we're going to have you know probably two and a half hours and some wire but yeah it should work usually\nCome out until you anyways when we were there when it will cost but if a number just budget number three twenty five you should be pretty good\nAll right let's try this one from Kevin I bought an electric plug that has a U. S. B. charging built in where I'd like to install it already has a G. F. CIA outlet can I Move the G FBI to another outlet that is already protecting orders that mess anything up\nUm bugs your if you ... you did you say he bought a G is the island with a USB port\nYeah ... was a bottle electric plug that has a USB okay charging built in\nUm if you're plugged you're supposed to be protected than you don't want to just throw a plug in there in France not protected they do so gee if I were the USB port so you can change that but there's no use and moving and you can yes you can move a gee if\nIf the Irish skeptical to another plug that's already protected if you want to is just that that plug is Eighteen dollars when you replace in like two dollar so yeah you don't have to\nYou can save is or you know using somewhere else but you know it's not illegal to have to justify is on the same circuit but are you just have you know basically forty dollars to the nurses in four\nIn the wall but um they do have a gee if I were a USB port also\nAll right if you have not heard this I'm going to save you if you have a crawl space under your house potentially\nFive hundred to as much as maybe four thousand dollars there about and you think I Want to sell you something like over go do something underneath your crawl space or something like that no\nThis is something that you are entitled to have should already have and if it's worn out it could cost you that much and it's called a farm and shielding and Jerry done that's where I ... what is that why would you care what's the deal and what what's been your experience you\nKnow it's funny you should say that 'cause this week\nAll oh here we go another one [laughter] I Love it my guys\nCome and tell them they there was a cat data a cat had gotten into this apartment shield and so they're in there and we're replacing the duck work I mean it was this probably four or five hundred dollar repair and out they were pulling the duck out and all of a sudden this cat comes running out and scare them both\n[laughter]\n... kind of scary you're not used to it and what did you know and so I think I'm not expecting it could have been a mountain lion charging ... you know yeah but\nYeah the the flashing wasn't installed properly on the unit and a cat a tunnel underneath there and got into the duct work and it was just he was living in there I guess or they didn't the owners didn't know the cats all ... had the cat torn in to the to the flexible ... had excellent torn in their ... ... ... out of it\nAll right so was there because it was so hot outside and they all this cat out a little bit air conditioning he was just trying to get cool so here's the thing if you do have the crawl space yeah the Varmus shield is supposed to be nice if improperly salsa install so what did they not do\nIf you want ... which I Would say anywhere from two fifty three fifty be safe number probably to go in the advocate and fishing down real fast and you know that you buy the light fixture record life but um [noise] a change now you know if you're just popping up played you don't need electrician or you could just screwed written\nOr could you tell the folks because I talked about this a little bit earlier today\nThis panel change business you know uh because you've said on the show\nIn most cases when somebody calls you saying hey I Need a new panel or I've had somebody come over here and give me a estimate for a new panel in most cases not necessary and somebody could be spending anywhere from twelve hundred to twenty four hundred dollars and not need to do that\nI'm In most of the time and believe it or not as the a Sikh or he's not a procedure Jerry what are the companies that homeowners you're probably going to need a pound change when they want to add a unit wow uh we get that an in home inspector sometimes say to them or because they see an old panel\nOr they're not used to seeing what it looks like but I'm ... and last year breaker and you don't you're not going to notice if you're if you're going to buy a house and you think he's about to change but\nIf if your main breakers always kicking\nEither there's two things you wrote a growing your house or you have a bad name breaker but if you you know if you turn on the stove and the AC in the wintertime and\nChristmas lights on that main kicks all the time and we we can test at Maine if it if it's a hundred ... up and you're pulling a hundred and ten AM and you know you go yeah we you outgrown house and then we just up the service but a lot of times man homeowners kennel the breakers in her pounding the Adam together\nSo if they have a hundred two hundred in Maine and they had all these breakers and it comes to two twenty over over it doesn't work like that 'cause it's what's another two hours in there but uh\nMost of the times you're not pull and a half of what your main is meaning\nAnd it sounds fine with will say that a lot of times I Want to pay all the other day matter of fact it was a hundred and fifty and panel they want to know if they had enough we put a sixty and they want to change it to a Ninety they didn't know if they had enough power so I ... in front of them in a commercial building a matter of fact it's a studio that they do the Kelly picture show out of\n... and uh they were pulling for ... for for for [laughter]\nAre they they're like we were were full and I know you're an elder breakers then it was empty there was only ... there were seven breakers hooked up and only two are being you know\n... what would only pull for ...\nLike isn't nothing nothing I mean I like the lost faith in the bathroom with you know somebody's life beyond just make up ... probably on it I didn't I don't know what's on the town just let them\nJacket but as funny my how I got a ... house in a pool I Am mine once it was forty apps yeah so it's that's when the electricity comes in but most times people tell him to change and a lot of the homeless back there's now once they get to these new codes\nAnd read them and see what changes like a nigger a for instance I'll just give it a small little sample in a garage brand new houses now you got to have a\nDedicated twenty ... circuit and the girls from plug okay you can still have Fifteen but the you have to have at least one ... that's the new code in a new code yeah just one of the little ...\nBut you know when so when these inspectors go in these houses don't be afraid when they write down ... because it's only for brand new ... brand new now ... so there's a lot more than that is just one day we'll go over more it's just\nBring that coach it and sometimes I hear that it's like oh she's a big book yeah but I mean the most stuff you've got to do you know oh yeah yeah\nWere you know the home stuff is just a you know the the thing for homeowners is going to be like the dish ... the washing machine or\nThe washers going to be our fault if I'm protected so basically when you hear no a lot of the houses will be the like the whole living room will be are also they're telling them use uh gee if I combo breaker because it's cheaper and us I plug the problem is when you hear all say hey my house I plugged in work\nNo big deal the living room still on the outside plug don't work they can live with that the changes and electricians ... breakers when if that gee if I kicks for being outside for rain now they're all living we down yeah there you go there it isn't going to be a mile so I plugged is going to be him my living rooms down yeah and you say a couple of hours what\nYeah right who are trying to find something closer than sooner now and some of the stars going to be on here [laughter] void\nThere would be a lot more homeowners get mad because there were breakers are going to kick for nothing major wrong thing to read whatever ... today is going to kick your living room now now you know in in the problem is when we say oh I'll be there sometime after lunch no problems outside plug we don't use it but when MTVs off into computers of as a whole\nBig deal a jury that we've got to get rid of watch I'll do that we understand you are the Amazon the filter business tell the folks

I Know and other\nYear tax on well how do to save money\n[laughter] talk about my favorites that was just getting excited about that when you walked in the door and I was just saying that you know in the past we've always had to zero in the ten but I really wasn't an easy way to plan around that because let's be honest if you were making ten thousand dollars or more you basically kicked out of those brackets unless you're in a capital gains us and\nYou know it's interesting one of the things that's a ... seems to be a common misperception is people don't understand basically the progressive nature of our tax fraud\nSo what I find a lot of times people come in and we're talking about a year and a twelve percent bracket you're twenty they think if they cross that bracket that that affects everything oh everything's tax at twenty two percent as opposed to\n... percent the Next Fifty at twelve percent and then what ever going to whatever\nIs understanding the difference then between the bracket and the tax rate\nRight we have an effective tax rate and then you have the tax bracket and normally when you do taxes he tried to explain because of that 'cause basically we have a zero which is of up until the standard deduction or and and\nPrior to that would have four thousand for married couple\nWell it I ... and of course if it gets even complicated because then you have to ... with the with the Social Security not all that and it tells certain dollar amount so there's some money you can make for free as long as you keep it under certain dollar amount but and that's why it's hard on\nThe radio show this because I see myself as I said here I think yeah that's right there is to\nPrevent you know but then you know because the capital gains of the different ... kind of family with in the family of taxes and have capital gains you have an income they may only become tax split certain income brackets and then of course when he gets a little bit higher you get the anti tax it sneaks into that\nOne of the things in and we get into this one I'm Talking to someone about doing or off conversion frozen you know the impact\nThat converting pain because if you're going to do a Roth converted if you're going to take some money from an IRA and you're going to convert that over to a Roth IRA understand you use that money that you're taking out it's just like a distribution you have is taxable income ... year so we're looking at for instance for a married couple\nA hundred thousand ... out a hundred hundred on one thousand and you you're you're effective tax rate because you are now at the upper end about twelve percent bracket but your effective tax rate is nine percent okay so overall when you factor in your direction when you factor in your\nYour standard deduction when you factor in the the ... the hygiene thousand dollar approximately that's actually the ten percent than the twelve it all works out to nine percent of the hundred grand\nSo nine percent tax rate and here's the thing if you've got those if you've got capital gains right or if you're going to do a raw conversion you want to make sure so if I have someone who they make and let's say their their ah casual income is sixty thousand\nAnd we we've got forty thousand we could convert to a Roth instill stay in a twelve percent bracket meaning that the and that's going to be taxed at about ... percent but after your and we're looking at well is your tax going to be potentially higher later maybe you're going to have our needs that are going to make you take a good idea hundred thousand or more\nI mean honestly on the last I don't know we like to say Twenty years and I know\nOf years that we've known each other 'cause I was a child apparently when we first met 'em [laughter]\nI Know that I\nDo now is\nThat um we we went out we kept saying we were at the lowest I mean since Reagan we're at the lowest bracket that way forever been at you know we never expected to see taxes go out go down in fact I mean not I really never thought in my lifetime I was going to see it go below Fifteen to zero ten Fifteen and to see this is exciting as far as I'm concerned\nUm but you know to see that now that's why I guess I pushed so much having you tried to come on the show and things because I think it's so important that people reevaluate\nWhat we had been telling people now for the last Twenty years may you know we're at the lowest bracket below the weight boom we're at a lower ... we've got five to seven years here I'm of a window that that are looking at making\nPotential changes I say five to seven kids Eighteen kind of is slipping by without much change because a lot of people are kind of waiting for laws rules and all that to come through so we're losing this first year really in some ways I mean your clients maybe jumping right and but\nI Know many of my clients are waiting to see how that affected on my tax returns really see what they can make and that's what\nWe do of course when we're doing it now says with people first thing we're doing is we're going to show him and that's your rights are through the year I'm meeting with clients and one of the things we do of course when we're doing a comprehensive plan is we're doing taxes exactly let's take a look and see what this new law is going to these new laws of the new tax cuts in JOBS Act\nIs going to how it's gonna affect you what's your what are your taxes going to be this year and how can we utilize that you know potentially in your planning\nAnd this may again going back to raw so we're looking at well I can project ahead and say well you're Ira depending on your age and everything we're talking about requirement um and distribution age seven and a half so let's say you're sixty two or sixty five whatever it might be\nWell now I've got all these years that I can and we've got seven years at least under this new correct I think it's more on the yeah okay [laughter] good vantage eyes and we know of and hopefully it'll be extended\nUh this is definitely an experimenting to see can we truly grow ourselves out of that we're going to find out what else are we going to get a pretty good way to other\nWays and haven't succeeded so out of debt is the best is I mean this is a good chance of doing something as anything\nElse and so far you have to admit stock markets been strong the real

[noise]\nVideo and I'm getting back out here and chatting with me a little bit about some of the pros and cons of maybe he didn't think that maybe people might not know about when it comes time to do some version or something like that anytime you're dealing with moving money around in retirement accounts it's real important\nUnderstand and understanding to you know this is one of those areas some\nSome misperceptions that people have with regard to how not just the taxes more as we talked earlier about how that affects your retirement accounts as well so here you're putting all this money into your four one K. and everything and it's growing tax for and you're getting his life tax reduction is great and then when the time comes in retirement to start taking that money I guess what a hundred percent tax will\nAt your highest tax rate meaning ordinary income tax rates knows that you know no special treatment as you might give a capital gains and that kind of thing\nSo understanding how that works and how you can mitigate it's an exit the scores Ross can come into play their\nTax deferred is great tax\nFree even better so one of the ... when we doing these kind of thank Ross conversions for moving money from one custodian to another we have to be very very careful because of the rules one of the rules being withdraw conversions\nThis year no longer can we do what's called a re characterization in other words a do over if you converted this money and you've got this money that's now going to be taxed when you go I went you know it created some additional taxes if I didn't anticipate like taxes on Social Security benefits as an example and you wanted to cut it back\nSorry we can no longer do a do over as we could in prior years for the re characterization pieces no longer available so we have to be more careful and this is I've run into problems with his where I've had clients come in we're working with their accountants and I call in and say hey\nYou know we're going to do this conversion how much can we can burn and they gave me a number and I said yeah you're okay here we and then we ran in and this this and ended up ... up triggering some taxes that we didn't anticipate\nWe were able at that time to re characterize went back to the campaigns like whoops we mean loops there's no loops\nHas been in a you know tens of thousands of dollars that way over the whole do you like to be on an operating table with Islam financially is just as bad so it might hurt just as the old man yeah exactly\nOne of the things here was friday when we do is that when when we're working with a client together I'm calling from saying okay I Want to do this she doesn't just\nRattle off a number to mirror so yeah this is okay she runs the actual return to see if we're going to trigger an EMT or if there's going to be some other hidden tax and we didn't anticipate that we can modify make sure we get it right the first time real important\nAnother one is rollovers that'd be real careful when you're rolling money over don't take that money into your own cause actually don't do they send you the check and you're thinking okay no problems can put it into this other account well guess what you only get to do that once in a twelve month period and it didn't matter how many accounts you only get one time\nOne account doesn't matter that's it you do another one sorry not allowed\nSo you can get into tax penalties and all that kind of things they show that there's a lot of the nation yeah not only just took it as in fact you can no longer you can't you took a hundred thousand out and say oh I'm just going to put over here and you've already done ten thousand inadvertently right and now you've got a hundred thousand in tackling ...\nAnd if you and and you definitely when you do that conversion you want to do custodial to custodial because if you do not what happens is that the in the year you get a ten Ninety nine are that shows distribution and then you need to prove to the IRS that it was deposited in a timely manner I think it's a thirty thirty eight\nYeah sixty sixty days ago I had to put on the spot every once in a while I'm\nSixty days or in you know dates from the distribution to there you have to prove that you have to attach that to the tax return because all the iris knows about is the distribution they've not they they don't receive another form saying that this was deposit here here's a ten Ninety nine are showing it\nNow if you could still do could still live then it shows the G and its roll over and everything's good so Jennifer you know really and you\nCould always add that emitted if you do if you want to transfer funds are you going to really or higher is made out to that new custodians either go lemon directly yeah even if it comes to you but it's made up to let's say to the American trade as an example I made up to the marriage rate for benefit of John Smith boom you're ...\nYou can take that chicken possession you can carry it over because they've never really was made up to you it was made out to the new ... and now you can do is unlimited amount you can do as many transfers would you like without any worry about any tax ...\nAnd this wasn't the things though if you don't do it right it could have a huge tax cuts but that's the only thing is I deal with the other side of that when the love letter comes from the IRS and it says hey you can ... blah blah blah and we're not that thing that you owe this much tax and the clients and they're going I don't know me\nPrimarily at higher risk is always looking for what's going to gain more tax exactly and I\nNot I'm really angry and come back and say you know what the IRS give me more money back\nEven though of cars families are now having to keep track of costs faces when you're selling off Fox or a mutual funds and I\nGuess what there was a time that's not the case and if you have stuff that predates when they had to keep those records is up to you to keep your records and if you don't and you sell them now I arrest these they're going to say that's a ... a sale just like with real estate they're going to tax you on the whole thing unless you can\nShow and on a schedule be that you get from it'll show no cost so unless you can come back and figure out and have always been grade with least coming back with a reasonable assessment of what that song daylight we've already did and things like that because it's really really important that you have that\nUm we had a caller that couldn't wait and his name is Marshall and he was asking about here and in fact I just wanted to touch on that really quickly for that I'm In Tennessee we don't have it in heaven had since Seventy I\nGot so it'll be inheritance factors do away with here at least for now are good so exactly never knows eh yeah\nAnd I had the uh gifts and\nA state tax that is a way out as\nA people again have a misperception about you know it's a unified exemption that you're getting for a gift and the states for this if teams house and that they're talking about is an example that only means at Fifteen thousand is you don't have to you can\nBuy that I I have to do a tax return at least what comes down to it's not you're going to pay tax unless you're ... you know making millions and giving like millions of dollars at some point you may hit that unify tax if you're doing by millions but the everyday normal person that might want to get their children twenty thousand\nOne time or whatever and the and the fifth in twenty Eighteen is Fifteen went from fourteen Fifteen just anyone that the gift thing\nA and wants to stay below that um you can do Fifteen\nBut um if you do have twenty or maybe your gift in a house or something like that there are ways of doing that I Would not suggest gift in a house in the early ... I Am a firm believer of I'm passing that on after that so I get to step up and bases personally speaking of first nominate live their exact you know unless for some reason\nUm even even if you're buying it for the children I Would I Would and you know I Would personally to leave it\nIn my name let them live there um you know whatever and then take it for you because\nYou're right I mean it's much better for them to take advantage of that stuff up and basis and you know and the gifting peace if you I mean if you are fortunate and you've got millions this was a ... point two million dollar exemption per person twenty two not going to happen to say give away a few million dollars and take advantage of exemptions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Mandis", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "27"}
