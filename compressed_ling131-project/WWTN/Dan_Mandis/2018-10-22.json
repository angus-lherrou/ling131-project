I could go on and on\nYeah Bernie Sanders out there looking all confused over the weekend is well wait till you hear the audio that he plays the that I play for you on Bernie Sanders in his appearances over the weekend\n... even confessed that he is considering his vice presidential options right now how would you like to be creepy porn lawyers vice president\nHe says I've given some thought to the following that in the event that someone like me and there are others in the field were to be the nominee what kind of feed Pete running mate should I be should I have in light of the current situation and what would the matchup beep let me stress this this is all about he says\nThe match up so Michael have an id is out there and he's saying he is\nNot absolutely going to run but he certainly making a lot of um a lot of noise and that is bad news for the Democrats because they don't have a real candidate that's out there\nNow apparently part of the story line is that ... he got really angry\nWhen he was challenged about how some in the media sided him and a lot of Democrats did two\nSided him as being responsible for blurring the lines on the brake Kavanaugh Supreme justice hearings we all know that story we all know that he brought this woman that sweating it gradually sweat Nick and she had all kinds of just\nThese accusations against cabinet that were just ludicrous and so one of the things that he is being blamed for is that was really a jump the shark moment for America\nAnd so when he was asked about that when he was asked about the fact that there were some people who held him responsible for blurring those lines he says that is a bunch of bull you know what it's a complete fallacy\nHe says this is driven by the fact that the right is not used to having a fighter on the left\nHe says I Am a threat and I am going to continue to be a threat to the Republican\nThis disgrace of a president Donald Trump\nSo he's really looking at utilizing the same talking points that he's been using for the past what at least year it's been a bit about a year since I've been out is to come into the limelight I think it's been about a year the whole Stormy Daniels thing\nHe was vigorously cheered by the audience by the way an added if I wasn't a threat to the Republican Party and and now this is what's important\n\nHe says if I was not a threat to the Republican Party and Donald Trump they would not be talking about me oh are you are wrong\nMichael ... the Republicans are talking about you because you were you were gods gift to Republicans that's why they're talking about you and Elizabeth Warren because you are a creepy porn lawyer\nWith a sketchy pass at best Michael's that is why people are talking about you because you will be a dream for the Republicans\n\nSo he's looking at it as the fact that while they're you know there are talking about me because I'm going to be some sort of a big threat against Trump now they're talking about you because you are easily beat a ball and they want you they want you to be the person that that is the spokesperson for the Democrats\nI think that's why the Republicans are talking about um\nSo there was a number of different things within this whole ... story line which I I'll I'll get into as the afternoon continues to unfold by the way\nI Love this because it seems like there is there something happening within the within the Democrats within the left and it seems to be a huge debate\nSo one of the things that I said did just moments in the show was that we have the Democrats and they've got really two names out there that are grabbing the headlines one is Michael have an ID and as we've been talking about there's a lot of Democrats who are absolutely apoplectic\nThat this guy is grabbing their spotlight the other one of the forces Hillary Clinton and this is from the Washington Post did you hear this\nMichael good when is out there and he's saying and there's others by the way that are also saying that you can absolutely count on Hillary to run in twenty twenty it's not that Hillary is so great the problem is that they really don't have again any messengers\nAnd so when you look at the fact that you have all of these people I mean there's there's a dozens of Democrats that are thinking about running against Trump in twenty twenty the problem is\nNot all of them apparently for the Democrats are up to muster which is on the same lines of what a ... he was saying as well\nAnd so this guy weeding out of the uh writing out of the Washington Post he really blast the Democrats and really picks them all apart\nAnd one of the things that he points out is that he's not the only one this guy from the Washington Post is not the only one that's pointing out that the Democrats have problems and certainly they gotta Hillary problem\nVanity Fair quote declaring that she still has not learned the lessons of hashtags me too is furious the Lincoln sat her husband's Oval Office daily it's with Monica Lewinsky was not an abuse of power because the twenty two year old intern was an adult\nHow about political political flatly declared Clinton a problem who will not go away and is fronting the Democrats don't know what to do about her\nAbout the Democrats and they're clean pin problem and they've got a double Clinton problem right I mean they've they've got to Hillary and bill problem\nAnd they just won't go away and there was a there is a a headline dear God Hillary Clinton please just to go now I Know I'm going to get the same emails from some of you folks there's like why are you talking about Hillary\nI'm Talking about Hillary because there's a lot of people who are thinking that she is going to run\nAnd New York Times' columnists noted noting that a Clinton is a a fond of gas and they focus for Republicans accused her of quote moral arrogance and wrote that someone needs to perform [laughter]\nSomeone needs to perform an intervention\nYeah that's funny now the Washington Post and Michael good one points out these three writers are all female that's right they're all female\nYou see Hillary has even more baggage now than she did in twenty sixteen because has checked me too has reared its head\nAnd so if you think Hillary was ... an obviously she was because we have a president Donald Trump if he thought Hillary was beat a bowl in twenty sixteen she is even more beautiful and twenty twenty because of hashtag me too\nSo good when points out all these three writers all female or not so much angry at what Clinton is saying as they are over the timing\nThey just sit there complaint is that she is hogging the spotlight they believe should be trained on Democrats running in the midterms their ... and it's the same thing with those Elizabeth Warren\nThey're mad because they fear that she is under cutting the holy war they subscribed to against\nPresident Trump now it isn't that really the ways of the left or who's getting a bunch of the press right now or the worst of the worst ... Hillary\nAnd Elizabeth Warren of course are for the wrong reasons with Elizabeth Warren I Would say Hillary for the wrong reasons as well I mean he's just out there you know talking about running for president\nBut Hillary and Elizabeth Warren we have we have major members of the media imploring Hillary to just go away in a post goes on implicit in the charge that Clinton is the problem is the assumption that others are the solution\nI guess that's the big question isn't it if not Hillary if not having a ... well then who\n\nBernie Sanders posts talks about how this guys running on vapors Cory Booker and by the way it is really creepy story about Cory Booker in the news today I don't even know if I can I talk about it is yet to that creepy\nMaybe I'll posted on the Facebook page and allow you to go look at it I Want to look at it you want to look at it don't you don't want to look at it what it is you know what it is yes is there any possible way that I could talk about that on the radio you cannot really or maybe I Will Bernie\nSanders running out vapors Cory Booker a white waiting to embarrass himself with the Spartacus ... and a ... brand is a do nothing hack\nOthers advertising their availability include of course we all know Joe Biden Eric Holder LA mayor Eric Garcetti and Deval Patrick former Massachusetts Governor I I think Biden is going to be the guy one percent and Joe is talking about\nThe wrong people which is why you need to Paul Paul Winkler right now six won five eight five one Nineteen fifty you call right now you get your free investors awareness guide it's all you need to know about the markets investing and what you need to know right now about your future\nDon't forget you can find them on line to talk when the dot com the radio show Saturday three to six year on WGN and the phone number one more time ten location located throughout middle Tennessee Paul Winkler six one five eight five one Nineteen fifty [noise]\nInformation view of being you know these these bills news talk leader so we're talking about ...

how much money someone makes the most important thing to know or their occupation their education their ZIP Code and their gender in that order after that according to a new study at a Temple University there is one personality traits they can\nAccurately predict the person's income the ability to delayed gratification the study's lead authors that if you want your child to grow up to earn a good salary considering stealing and then the importance of passing on smaller immediate reward in favor of larger ones that they have to wait for\nAnd so now you've got to the royal family who are surprised and shocked by the backlash\nAnd they say this was um this was in the daily mail no one was reportedly more surprised than the crown prince who couldn't see why the story was such a big deal\nThey say he was really shocked that there was such a big reaction to it to another a source close to the royal family said\nNow I understand that because here's the thing\nThat is the question why is it that the death the murder of ... is getting so much in the way of headlines why is there such a a worldwide backlash\nWhen they've been doing this for a long time why is everybody now suddenly outrage\nIs it because of Trump maybe\nBecause of the fact that the president has been doing everything they possibly can\nAnd to work on his relationship with the Saudis including entering into that a hundred and ten billion dollar business deal with the Saudis to sell them arms and so now the media is not only making about Donald Trump and what his reaction should be whether we're talking about sanctions Bob Corker came out just a\nOver the weekend and said that he believes\nThat it was the royal family that I did this a horrific thing to this journalist and so now\nA Bob Corker and others are saying that there should be sanctions\nAnd it's real easy to say for an outgoing senator to talk about how there should be sanctions and I do understand that\nI really do but the other thing that you understand that you have to understand is the president has not only an American economy to protect but he's got a world economy to protect and the other thing I Would ask is why is it on Trump's shoulders\nYou know why why is he the one that he's supposed to now all of a sudden what protect all of these are all these these people in Saudi Arabia who are going up against the royal family why why is this all on Trump to be the policemen for the world\nI think that's another aspect of this and that a lot of people are are asking frankly which is why so why is it we are responsible to hold the leash of the Saudis was because we have a closer relationship with them from a from a business standpoint\nYou know we are reliant on their oil and were reliant on a number of different uh business relationships with him including again a hundred and ten billion dollar arms now here's the very latest is again came out over the weekend after weeks of denying they knew anything about the show is a disappearance the Saudi Government has since claimed\nHe was killed in a fist fight after getting into an argument with individuals who met him at the constantly by the way there's yet another new version of what happened on a Sunday Now is Saudi official ... was killed\nAfter he was placed in this show called us telling you about this show called position to prevent him from leaving the conflict and calling for help then can show gets body was the end given to a local cooperate are quote unquote a for disposal and assemble and that the investigation continues\nEight teams men have since then detained by the government in connection with the show these murder but everybody who was an expert on Saudi Arabia most people understand that these Eighteen men they were more than likely be put down but they did this at the behest of\nThe Saudi royal family now the media is trying to do all of a sudden make this about Jared Kushner puts Mohammed was reportedly so astounded by the international response to show that he even reached out to Jared Kushner\nYep he reportedly called crush on October tenth eight days after the show get disappeared and asked him why the outrage why is it would be so upset we do this all the time\nAccording to sources who were briefed on the phone conversation so apparently John Bolton national security advisor and Jared Kushner reportedly told the prints that he needed to quote get to the bottom of Mr ... show these disappearance and fast\nYou know it it does seem like they're they're absolutely caught you know with their pants down in the sense that can show gay he he he walked into the embassy there in Turkey and he never walked down supposedly there's audio\nI personally believe that the uh the Turkish government there I think that they had the consulate Saudi Arabia is a conflict bugged and that's how they got the audio of this guy screaming maybe some video to who knows as his fingers are one by one chopped off\nThen they gave him a shot up something drug them up and then they killed them they beheaded them decapitated him is a horrible horrible thing but again this has been going on for years I think part of this\nIs that show was living in the United states and he was writing for the Washington Post so I think you know in a way you've got a lot of folks here in America maybe journalists who identify more whiskey show again so that's why now this has become more of an incident then it may have otherwise been\n\nSort of everybody's focused on the relationship apparently between Jared Kushner and is prince\nAnd that it's such a big deal and so now the president is out there trying to downplay this relationship between ... and a the prints telling reporters on Saturday that they are just too young guys who are the same age that said\nHe also claimed the crush their barely knows the thirty three year old ... even though the two men have had apparently several one on one meetings and our reporter to communicate with each other fire what's app which is a private messaging system\nSo I guess everybody's going to ignore the fact that ah the Saudi royal family gives a a whole bunch of money to the Clinton Foundation or we all just going to ignore that apparently so she got the president now talking tough and this is what the president needs to do\nIt the president has a up to ten thousand person caravan\nComing towards our southern border with Mexico he's dealing with Honduras he's dealing with the El Salvador he he's dealing with Guatemala he's dealing with Mexico he's dealing with huge things going on here in this country and now he's got to worry about this\nAnd so he gave an interview the president did to the Washington Post and he's saying all the right things he's doing all the right things and he's talking tough\nHe tells the Washington Post ah obviously there's been deception and there has been lives he says their stories and he's absolutely right on this the stories of the royal family they're all over the place he says on Saturday but in the same interview Trump defended\nPrince Mohammed leadership and praised him for having very good control\nNow listen\nYou folks do that I'm a supporter of President Trump but when the president says that prince Mohammed and the leadership there they they have very good control well it's because they'd be had the people that disagree with them I\nI mean you know\nKind of watch what you say President Trump anyway moving on from there and he went on to say that he is seen no evidence that the crown prince ordered or even knew about the killing of ...\nNobody has told me he is responsible nobody's told me that he's not responsible and the president says we haven't reached that point he says I haven't heard either way he says there is an absolute\nPossibility he found out about the the murder of ... afterward you know it could be something that uh he went into the building and something went badly or why it could be that when he found out to do find they'll find his body they'll figure something else out as far as what exactly did happen\nBut right now the president says we we just don't have any answers he says maybe they did indeed know that they were bringing it back to a Saudi Arabia they wanted to bring it back to Saudi Arabia and you know the interrogation went bad and they ended up with chopped off fingers and chopped off had\nI I don't know but that's what the president saying\nNow this is the president of the United states\nAnd when we're talking about the world's economy when we're talking about oil when we're talking about sanctions\nI I don't blame the president for being cautious I really don't even even Bob Corker when he was calling for sanctions one of the things that uh he said was well listen I Do I think that they did it yeah but we ... we need to see a evidence we kind of need to see how it all plays out\nHere's his quote do I think he did he was talking to CNN a Corker says do I think he did it yeah I think he did it\nBut still we need to know exactly what happened will have to hear the audio we'll have to speak to witnesses or whatever needs to happen but there's a lot that goes into the president's reaction\nAnd again I'm going to go back to the same thing which is okay so why is this suddenly now a huge issue why is the media so hyper focus on the murder apparent murder\nOf ... I think it's because the media is\nTrying to make this a huge deal which it is but again we can go down the road of how many journalists they've killed how many dissidents\nHave they killed in Saudi Arabia everybody's known this the Clintons knew when they accepted all of those are the millions of of political donations that they have given to the Clinton Foundation and we can go on and on and on about who knew what suddenly this is all my Donald Trump\nWhich is why you need to be armed with a letter of pre qualification from first community mortgage now these folks have been helping middle Tennessee in four years get into their dream homes and you could be next\nNow I Love my friends that first community mortgage they make it easy for you with local processing and local underwriting so you can get answers fast because when you're looking for that mortgage when you're looking for that letter pre qualification\nTiming is everything and these folks care about our vets and that's why they offer no mentor fees on VH loans in Ninety eight percent of their clients would recommend first community mortgage to their family and friends now you know it's called the human mortgage\nYou deal with actual people to answer the questions you have regarding your home loan so column today one eight hundred goats human that's one eight hundred goes human it's human mortgage dot com first commuted to mortgages an equal housing lender and in my last number sixty two Ninety seven hundred [noise]\nInformation view\nOpinion driven the skis bills news and talk leader super tall not eat I [noise]\n... new singer I'm Pamela fair with your town stories the migrant caravan with thousands from the Central American country of Honduras continue their trend toward the United states Patrick Othman reports the masses are poor with little belongings given food here\nSome water for these people really don't how much money and said that they run out of water they're exhausted but they have so far to go if you're carrying their belongings next to me here's a few things that have you seen people\nTraveling with children caring for you know they've already come so far some of them probably more than a week and they have weeks or to go before they reach U.S Mexico border\nNow Democrats are being blamed by President Trump for that caravan Trump tweeted this morning that that immigration laws or because of the dams and said it's unfair to those who come to America legal aid\nMeanwhile the Trump Administration will roll out details of a plan that makes it easier for small businesses to offer for oh one K. plans to employees labor secretary Alexander Acosta tells W tens Michael Dell joined it impacts tens of millions of American workers\nWho have had to leave jobs that they love in order to benefit from a four O. one K. savings plan they can\nStay they can stay right where they are they can stand her family business they brought proposal that apply to all the for profit not for profit\nThere will be sixty day public comment period after today before the rules are finalized\nHappening here in middle Tennessee forensic scientist with the TV I had to analyze a letter sent to the grandparents have missing five year old Joe Klein Daniels was sent last week claiming the boy is still alive the TV I is not saying who they think what the letter but\nAnd handed over their results to the Dixon county sheriff and the district attorney investigators say the boy's father has admitted to killing his son that has refused to tell where the body is\nOver in West Tennessee this morning\nWas detected that magnitude three point three grade was attacked it around six o'clock this morning near tipped him build the U.

thousand sixteen the world changed run like a girl that you think a lot of people I paid sick of\nIt so much more than a way it's supposed to nominate change headed our way on November ...\nThat he's no longer going to send any kind of a foreign aid to Honduras or El Salvador or Guatemala or to the very least is going to cut a big time and I think that's a great idea I really do\nBecause it's about damn time that we get serious about this New Mexico is not going to get serious about it that we need to do something\nWe need to do something so that this this caravan of between seven and ten thousand 'cause that's what they're saying is right now the caravan of somewhere between five and seven thousand and the thinking is that there's going to be a more people joining the caravan as it continues to head towards our border\nAnd so if we don't stop these folks at the border before they\nTo the border then we're going to have flowers and more and it's the same concept that we've been saying all along it's the same trend that we've been saying all along you remember when President Trump was first elected president and any time that the president or Jeff Sessions anytime they speak\nThey talked tough on immigration and they talking about deporting people they talked about turning people away at the border we know what happens\nThere's far fewer people that that make that track because they figure they're just going to get turned around\nAnd it is a statistical fact that when the president talks tough people stop coming when he stops talking tough and this is where the president blames the Democrats when he stops talking tough because of political correctness because he's getting absolutely brutalized in the media then they started coming again\n\nYou can see the pattern it's been it's been very consistent\nAnd so I think one of the things that the Democrats have been trying to do is politicize this caravan this caravan won by creating the caravan because we're all somebody what they do is they start to care of and because the the original caravan had what what did I read on friday like sixty sixty five Seventy whatever was it was very small amount\nAnd now it is swelled the seven thousand could swell up at ten thousand before they get to our border so this is what we're up against and if we don't turn these folks around then we're going to be greeted with hundreds of thousands more\nAnd so now the Democrats are realizing you know we may shake this yet again\n\nJust like the whole cabinet saying we remember the cabinet narrative where Brett Kavanaugh he was going up for a Senate confirmation hearings and and we know what the Democrats did they they treated him like absolute garbage we all know what happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nSo now the Democrats were thinking okay so the whole cabinet think clearly didn't work so now here's what our great grand plan is George Soros is your going to fund yet another migrant caravan now when I say I does everybody understand when I say funding the the migrant caravan so there are these groups\nAnd they're they're supposedly non profits and so what these groups do is they help these folks from Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala they helped them in this track\nOr from their country through Mexico into America they sort of\nThey sort of guide them the escort them they showed them the way George Soros himself has financed the apps that help these folks get away from the authorities the sources developed apps to help these people come across the Mexican desert so we know that source does this\nAnd so what they decided to do was okay so here's how we're going to do this\nSoros is going to fund another care of and we're going to make it look like this is a big humanitarian thing and then the president will be forced to deal with this humanitarian effort\nBy doing what by turning people away at the border then we'll have our friends in the mainstream media they'll sit there and they'll take all these photographs of these women with their small children and look how awful\nThe president is and this is just how the Democrats do think it's quite brilliant actually it really is\nI hate it but the president has to deal with this now and this is something that Republicans are going to have to deal with now here's what the Democrats are missing what the Democrats are missing is that there's a lot of Republicans a lot of folks within the G O P A lot of Trump supporters\nWho right now are not activated this caravan and the ... this is this is not this is like just like ... of middle fingers\nThat are being that are being raised white at President Trump and and you and I as people who want our immigration laws enforce that is what does it it's thousands of middle fingers\nMike Pence the day before this caravan started was out there saying do not come you will be turned around\nYet here they come\nWith all of these thousands of middle fingers raised directly here at America\nSo now what the Democrats may have managed to do is they managed to activate more Republicans\nMore people who perhaps we're sitting by the sidelines because we know that Republicans in twenty sixteen were activated by three words build the wall\nAnd there was also lock her up but that's beside the point so now we have President Trump and or the Republicans trying to deal with and trying to decide what happens when these folks arrive on the border\nSo it's my opinion that this may have once again backfired on the Democrats and so now there's this story on Fox News but I've seen this in a couple of different places\nTop Democrats are urging caution on this whole blue wave quote unquote and they're trying to temper expectations I think the reason for that is because they're realizing now that there's a George Soros paid for a caravan and this whole narrative may backfire\nTop Democrats are working to manage expectations Fox News reports about this blue wave sweeping the party in power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs that the midterms could be much closer than anticipated can you imagine\n\nIf at the end of the night we still have control of the house and we still have control of the Senate\nWas just over two weeks to go before the critical elections which by the way we're we're predicted to keep all of the Senate anyway but that's beside the point with just over two weeks to go before the critical elections Democratic National committee chairman Tom ... saying\nJust hours ago that he is not using the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for his party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who by the way has her eyes on the Beagle speaker's gavel say just days earlier that they could be looking at a democratic tsunami\nPer as predicted a tight race for control of Congress and I think the reason why prices doing this of course is because they want the Democrats to come out I mean that's the thing ... in my opinion being smart because he doesn't want\nThe Democrats to become complacent he wants to Democrats to to come out in a suit on me and say if you go to Nancy Pelosi out there and she's talking about oh yeah there's going to be a suit on me okay well then\nSome Democrats may say well this is in the bags or we're not going to go out no prizes doing it smartly he's saying no it's going to be close and you need to get your tales out there and vote\nHe says we always knew that this election was going to be close he says I'm not using the term blue wave I always talk about the need for the blocking and tackling pres telling CNN\nI always talk about the need for organizing to make sure that you're leading with your values and that's how we've been a wing throughout this year and through\nTwenty Seventeen so we'll have to see what happens I I Do think that the president is right when he said over the weekend and last Thursday night that this is going to be an election that's going to be all about cabin on the caravan law and order and common sense\nWhat he says and he's absolutely right and the difference is how people see the caravan this there's seven to ten thousand once it hits our border will there be seven to ten thousand of these of these quote unquote migrants that want to turn into illegals by coming across our border\nThe question is should the president and he should utilize our military to support border patrol he absolutely should know the left they ... and the media they're presenting this caravan\nAs almost they almost a humanitarian issue and while I Do understand that it is far far more than that and we'll talk about there isn't a whole lot more straight ahead\nOn super talk Ninety nine seven WGN including all the latest on the
