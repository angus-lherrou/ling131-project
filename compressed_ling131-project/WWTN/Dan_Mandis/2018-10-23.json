the Russians and the United states for many many years\nYou know people weren't necessarily as passionate as they were into twenty sixteen election same with a you know John McCain certainly running against\nA bronco bomber people who voted for John McCain might say yeah I voted for McCain but I'm I'm really I'm really okay with Obama because everybody not me but a lot of people had bought into this whole hoping\nChange business but this election in twenty sixteen I think left such an imprint on Americans and most certainly on the younger generation the question is what did they learn if anything\nAnd that's a question and we'll find out in the mid term elections but saying that they now have these symptoms of pie TST and that they had clinically significant levels of stress\nTells me that our younger generation are are college students for example what they really need to do if they need to understand how to change things if they're not happy with a result this is the problem that we have with the Democrats quite frankly 'cause what do we know about Democrats\nWhat do we know about their inability to deal with those whose opinions and belief system is different from there's what did we see over the weekend right we saw Mitch McConnell getting ... getting badgered and harassed in\nA a restaurant he and his wife sitting there on they're trying to do is is have a bite to eat and yes indeed we've seen this time and time and time again Mitch McConnell is in there getting absolutely blasted\nSo the more the the Democrats are out there doing all of these do various things whether it's harassing a Republicans and in restaurants or a interfering with the ah with some of the um oh what would you call them you know the the gathering that the meetings the town halls of Republicans\nThe more that they've been doing this and this most certainly hadn't been doing this over the last couple of years\nThe worst thing looks for them and that's why President Trump is most certainly now gone quote unquote all end to protect the GOP majority in the final mid term stretch and so now with the president is doing\nIs he is really putting his money where his mouth is he is not only going from one part of America to the other campaigning for people like Ted Cruz and he was campaigning yesterday\nA for Cruz last night and I've got some audio a great performance by the president but one of the things that you got to realize is that yeah he's campaigning and those are huge and I mean huge opportunities for the president to rally his base\nBut he's also bringing in millions and millions of dollars\nHere's the problem though even though he's bringing in millions of dollars the Democrats are bringing in even more but listen to that some of the I'm just a little bit about what's happening with the numbers game and and what the Democrats are doing\nWith their new fundraising website too I Would say any way and manipulate their fundraising goals so we will talk about that because at least to me\nWhat the Democrats are doing is necessary to say the least we'll get into that in the next few minutes but President Trump is campaign operation is planning an advertising blitz for the final two weeks stretch before\nThe midterms as part of a multimillion dollar bid\nTo help Republicans keep control of Congress according to Fox News and a couple of other outlets now\nThat includes millions of dollars they six million dollar at TV and digital advice set to launch next Monday and lasted through election day I Will say this isn't it amazing\nHow far the president and the Republican Party have gone I mean they have really their relationship let's just say the president and the Republicans did not necessarily get along when this whole thing started a couple of years ago now we have the president really it seems to me\nHe's trying to save the Republican Party so we will get into that and a whole lot more straight ahead but it's doing to check in with read in Nashville on WGN have read\nIt and I get up now hey I'm so my comment that I I Am a veteran with ... the I was in the tail end of the Gulf War and I was a four year in Bosnia keeping 'em\nThree warring factions apart and and sorting through killing field and stuff like that and for for these these children nowadays millennials to it to hide behind that's not the ... the company that I\nYou know I I I bought with six years of service and um have to pay for for you know the ... with my life it's it's it's ridiculous to the point of being offensive to me\nWell read I read have you have you noticed that whether it's these are these students from Arizona State university saying that they have\nA pi TST symptoms to people who are saying and claiming that they have the TST so that they can bring their pets onboard an airplane and it just so we know and just so you and I are on the same page read\nI Know that there are very serious and legitimate claims for a service animals but it seems like the whole notion of pie TST ... it seems to have been hijacked over the last couple of years\nHe is the is a it's an individual election it's like alcoholism as it affects everyone differently um\nWhich means everybody's got different triggers but I I Can't speak to this whole issue about bringing peacock since world on a third of animal\nFor for the wrong it it's just another hijacking of\nOf you know it's marginalizing things that are Syria and the thing of value them and taking things that are there and making them ridiculous are illegitimate\nAnd I think that that's what we're seeing before but this gradual eroding values um and they're laughing onto a topic that the way they flag that can be waited on both sides of the oil\nThing well we care about our our veterans and this and that one of those ... one of the topics that they can grab onto yeah and and just say well do we care about our veterans were going to acknowledge him but the reality is they don't like the veterans anymore than Republicans if they had it their way\nThey would do away with the military and put every one of\n'em you know it's like Norway or something like that so right\nThey they they don't care about that and for me personally you know they they need to be very careful because\nUm people with trip here the the ... we let things summer and things you know become very well for as long as we can take it but you know they're they're they're pushing a lot of buttons or people that otherwise [noise] [laughter] yeah\nUm don't don't see things the way that they they they think they see the world and until you've been behind a traitor until you ... and lived over there and a place that that the people were just kill you they shake their hand [noise] um you don't have the right to granted\nUnderstand everybody's got the perpetrator but are there the point where it gets a little bit ridiculous I mean they're just sort of\nYou know recognize what is what is real and what does he know crow back\nOut and I read thanks very much and thank you for sharing your story and appreciate your service very much it said twelve Eighteen on super talking and nine seven WGN he is absolutely right and one of the things that\nYou know going back to when I opened with which is\nThe twenty five percent of students that said they were so traumatized by the twenty sixteen election that they have pie TST I think part of what they're doing is they're they're sanitizing\nWhat really causes pie TST and you know reach talking about his journey with the TST in in what he went through in and the reason why she has pie TST and he spent\nA six years in service and so this is the guy who is seen God awful things and so you've got these uh twenty five percent of students who are claiming that they themselves have pie TST because of the election of twenty sixteen is really almost laughable and as read said yeah let's take some of these students and have them\nHave them see what Reid has seen another veterans have seen and then see if they will still claimed pie TST so again I appreciate the call it is a twelve Nineteen on super talk Ninety nine seven W T and so yeah the president is going all end to protect the Republicans the majority and so he is giving\nIn a number of different ways not only a support financially but also hitting on out on the campaign trail in one of the things that I find interesting I'll get into some of these some of these numbers because this war chest folks is absolutely huge\nThat the president is bringing forth for the Republicans but one of the things I find interesting is you have some Democrats to as part of their campaign is they're trying to tie the Republicans to\nPresident Trump and it seems to me like that very well could backfire given the fact that the president's approval ratings are right now so incredibly high so we'll talk about that and a whole lot more again we've got the latest on the caravan it is not good news it is really interesting though\nThe things that the president is saying and how the media is portraying what the president is saying for example when the president says well yeah you've got him is Thirteen and you've got\nFrom the middle east and you've got all these other different factions there within this huge caravan of what seven to ten thousand now heading a across Mexico and heading up towards our border and so then you'll have some of these ah various news agencies they will say well the president just saying this\nWith no proof said well you tell me

frankly because what happens in Nashville does affect everyone in middle Tennessee it's\nAll about amendment one and I want to welcome on and James small words from the fraternal order of police at James always appreciate having you folks on so\nWe know they do early voting has already been done I'm not exactly sure where we are as far as amendment one goes in and out what people are saying about it who are voting against it and who is voting for it but I guess my question to you is this\nAs early voting has now be gun what's the state of mind of metros police force right now\nWell you know and first of all French wrote me on her shirt on and let me talk about what's going on in the world [noise] um I think metro gr watching watching what's going to unfold here were certainly very concerned we're concerned that are there are so an amendment on the ballot\nThat would allow or people that don't have the training the experience the knowledge necessary to judge the announcers action and that is very concerning for us\nMen when of course it is as everybody knows would create a taxpayer funded eleven member commission they would have the ability to review complaints about the police and make quote unquote non binding recommendations\nOr this commission would cost at least two million dollars per year and it's essentially as we all know a community oversight board and and as I've been you know very honest in my assessment of this whole thing it is something that is most certainly politically motivated and most certainly an anti police but let's talk a little bit about\nBecause one of the things that I've seen over the last couple of days is the fact that you folks or somebody there's a a pack or whoever was it said that this is a ten million dollar\nTax hike and there was some pushback on that saying well no this is an eight and ten million dollar tax hike let's talk a little bit about that either they ten million dollar tax hike what would the ultimate cost about me\nWell certainly if you look at the budget is proposed by ... ... is on one eight six million dollars annually\nUm and that doesn't include the cost of police compliance participation it doesn't include the cost her a tea or computers and networking and all that stuff or room so reasonable person could easily assumed that the cost is going to be two million dollars a better over five years I came across national parks or ten million dollars that's ever done that committee that already does the same thing\nThat ah we already have committees in place for them out recently called attacks like this\nUm the the metric government is is struggling financially weren't economic hard times as hard as ... as hard as that is to believe\nMetro can't pay their bills there last year that it was either we raise taxes to pay the bills or we don't pay the bills and they chose not to pay the bills and they did raise taxes so how can we say that we're we're going to have a an even larger debt service to finance\nAnd an even larger a bill next year the adding two million dollars is not going to create some sort of a tax increase on our community if it doesn't then we're not going to conduct properly\nOn the other thing is where we have with police cameras I Know this is somewhat off the topic but I'm sure I I Know that I'm a big advocate for it\nAnd I'm an advocate for the police cameras because I think that oftentimes at police are wrongly accused and so what we've seen in in some instances any way that the police are accused of something nefarious then you look at the tape and it turns out the police were right and just in whatever action they were trying to take so\nAs far as I Know hasn't did the use of police cameras there are still trying to figure\nFigure out if I'm not mistaken you how to buy them where to store the or the files you know the the video once they're recorded I mean it's a big math\nRight and you know I mentioned earlier the cost of Metra government during business is only getting more and more but you're going by cameras are budgeted already for Fifteen million dollars I can tell you that's not enough to run the program that's just enough to buy the body cameras and do you know maybe the first year storage data storage is the most expensive part of body cameras and I'll tell you this\nUh the members of the police and police officers in Nashville are I'm In favor of body cameras because you're absolutely right it's not going to show us doing things are going to show the public that we are doing our jobs right we're doing our job especially on that basis that means that we know that this is going to be a major cost to the department of the city\nAnd that that has to be taken into account now I Know they've been approved it's going through the purchasing process which is a very long and tedious process to make sure that that that's a fairly without any kind of influence from political\nInsiders and so on and so forth so we just have to be patient and wait for those kind of my eyes imagine there will be on the streets and\nUh we were somewhere around one thousand four hundred and forty officers sworn in the police department so we're already a hundred short recruitment and retention has been a bigger problem in the last you know six months to a year than we've ever seen it and if we implement something\nThat isn't going to fairly represent all areas of the community isn't gonna fairly a judge police officers' actions I was going to cost the city and the other two million dollars a year and can bring it over five years yeah\nAbsolutely are going to see police officers are leaving a higher rate and you're not going to the new ones coming across door\nSo James real quickly in maybe thirty seconds or less so you said in the last six months to a year recruiting has been an issue uh in is it because of programs and attitudes are like what we see coming out of the hole and then won a conversation or what has been the biggest issue for a recruiting effort you folks\nWere affected by it partly that it's partly the wife society has twisted or the law enforcement professional from the good guys into the villains and we all know that's not that's not the case where here serving the public\nAnd we put our lives at risk every day to try and protect our communities and then you've also got you know I'm\nAmbitious district attorneys in in in politics getting in the way of policing and and that's not appropriate we've had an officer who\nWas doing his job in protecting his community and a shot a man with a gun in his hand and and now he's been arrested and that's by no stretch of the imagination is that appropriate so people are looking at this and they see that the police are doing a good job but they're not being treated fairly and their goal why would I Want to put myself on the line like that\nIf I'm not going to be treated right when I Do what I'm told that do\nNot

actually think that'd be pretty a pretty interesting\nAh right to get back to the news um it is one fourteen on WGN everybody's talking about the caravan\nNow one of the things that the president has been saying over the last couple of nights he he's really been hitting the caravan hard and and the reason for that is because it is absolutely positively generally speaking a mid term election issue\nNow that I find fascinating is you have the Democrats who for whatever reason their mom on this whole thing even though we know that George Soros is is there ever was I don't know if he's still is but he he was funding to get this whole thing started I'm assuming that\nThat he's still if you got these groups say well an escort this caravan across Mexico out of a El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras\nAnd so now what we're finding a lot of this stuff we already know\nA lot of this stuff is pretty much old news for those of us who have been watching these particular caravans over the past many years it was just back in April and we're talking about this\nAnd so one of the things that the president said over the last couple of days of the fact that you do have MS Thirteen gang members and you have a man from the middle east uh within this throng of thousands of migrants now what I find interesting\nIs you have some of these various media outlets who will say and I've noticed is that the president says that without any proof\nHe is saying that MS Thirteen gang members and men terrorists from the middle east are in these huge migrations they this huge caravans and they'll say without proof the president a legit this without proof well listen\nHere's what we know first of all when you're talking about uh seven to ten thousand and I understand I I totally get right now the numbers are uh seven thousand that that is the number that you're seeing in the media\nBut that's going to rise up to ten thousand by the time they finally reached that's the that's the predictions that this caravan is going to reach a total of ten thousand migrants then once they come into our country if they get in\nThan they are going to be a whole bunch of illegal aliens and then we're going to have all kinds of problems in the secret as we all know is to stop these folks before they stepped foot into our country so I think the president is spot on when he says you know what I'm going to use the military to\nTo assess and support a border could border patrol so that we make sure that these folks do not come into our country but we know that and that Thirteen and it was this was all under Obama folks\nMS Thirteen had a huge resurgence when we had these these migrant caravans come into our country that is that if they documented fact from back in at twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen right around there\nSo we also know that there were there were many reports of of Middle Eastern men coming into our country through our porous border so\nYou know I I don't know how else to say it we do know that this is something that has been happening for a long time now when you're talking about a a caravan of some seven to ten thousand people and the AP I Love this story from the ...\nI don't know if you saw this but the a P said you know we've got a couple we've got a couple of 'em I'm Sorry I just went out and we all good now the lights went back on so I'm assuming we're still on the air about but a little inside baseball here at various gadgets hope we're still on the air\nBut uh when we talked about the migrants we talked about a ten thousand people the the Associated Press came out and said and get back my train of thought it just so weird your your trucking right along and then all the lights around you and all the computers run to just go dark and you're thinking oh um but what I Would say the Associated Press says oh yeah we have reporters embedded\nIn the caravan and they have not seen\nAnyone who is in MS Thirteen gang member or a member of ISIS for example or somebody who was a terrorist well it's not like they're going to walk around and say hey I'm a proud member of al ... I'm a proud member of ISIS\nAnd as far as MS Thirteen goes it's the same thing\nYou know you have some members of MS Thirteen and we know that they have snuck across the border before so this is all just kind of silly for the members of the media to say well we haven't encountered any members of MS Thirteen it's not like they're going to raise their hand and say\nYou know hey I you know I killed a bunch of Thirteen year old's a couple of days ago is it the third they're not going to do that\nNow what about the deportees you know the people that we have we have kicked out of this country for various and sundry reasons well guess what now they are coming back as well\nDo I need to remind you the story of case finally now we all know the story of Kate Steinle issue was killed by a guy in San Francisco and he he had just gone he fires the gun he shoots he kills a Kate Stanley this is a guy and stop me when you've heard this before\nWe had a ... how many people have been killed by these are folks who have been in and out of this country numerous times\nI mean that that that is such a a story that we see and hear all too often and so now the question is is with this caravan coming towards our country we do know now that deportees had been joining the migrant caravan to return to the U.S\nAre we really going to be able to figure out all ten thousand or so of these deportees no of course not\nSo one of the ongoing stories that we've seen in this country is these folks who keep sneaking back into our country and committing a porn crimes\nMany of the migrants according to Fox News here had previously lived in the United states and are now coming back across our border and joining the Caribbean to reunite with their children or to resume old jobs they were undeterred by the American authorities who had\nA free handed them or the U.S president who promised to keep them out again one of the other things that I find interesting\nAbout the media coverage\nOf all this and I must have read three or four different articles on this and we're we're now in the in the stage of the media coverage and we see this all the time right\nWhere they start profiling some of these migrants coming over the are heading towards our border and it's always the same thing is it's some woman somewhere and she's got three kids and no father and they're they're traveling to America to make a better life for themselves and and that is the narrative\nA these nations like Honduras and El Salvador and then they were coming in through our very porous border and again just to go back to it if I like people are raising their hands and saying you know hello I'm from a you know I'm from Pakistan I'm from Afghanistan now\nThey're trying to blend in with everybody else because that is how you sneak into a country to begin with just saying\nIt's one thirty one on super talk to any of that seven WGN demand to show autumn is here the marshmallows are roasting the leaves are falling and making memories has never been prettier\nLet me tell you that my friends had twin creeks village they are located on beautiful Tim's Ford lake and they'd like you to join them in bringing in the fall season\nImagine enjoying your fine cup of coffee in the morning on beautiful Tim sport like you can do that if you check out twin creeks village and choose to get a home right on the lake for one day only\nOctober twenty seven to fall in love with lake living and a fraction of the costs\nAre right now they've got a huge opportunity for you at twin ... village ... covered the boat slips distorting it thirty four nine late combs a starting at one twenty nine ... village they are now up to twenty thousand dollars off these are great news\nYou great deals harvest these one day only deals and they promise it'll feel like Christmas\nCame early so don't deal a act now and stopped making excuses and start making memories with twin creeks village lake living at its finest reserve your appointments today limited supply called six went five five three five zero eight three seven\nSix five five three five zero eight three seven or you can find them online at ... dot com don't miss him once in a lifetime opportunity to own a piece of beautiful lake property that twin ... village on temps Fort Meigs scheduling appointments by calling six went five\nFive three five zero eight three seven tone damn man just told you to call you can also find them online and twin creeks T.

Vinnie he he had a um he had a beautiful red Christmas sweater that we put him in every single year so I dogs I can get a chicken first of all can you imagine trying to catch a chicken to to put a ah

are being told not to trick or treat with their chicken this Halloween\nIs it they just can't be I got this right off of ABC News I I'm reading halfway through this and thinking is this fake news\nThe CDC is asking pet owners to refrain from dressing up their chickens this year due to a particular strain of salmonella what Sam and now it's coming up twice in this program so far today\nI got sure smacks coming back into the are coming back into grocery stores barely recovering from this summer's that big salmonella problem that apparently sugar smacks had back in the summer and now you can buy those back in the stores there they are finally coming back and limited supply right now\n\nAnd I got these chickens and this particular strain of salmonella that I I guess is that going around because people are taking their chickens trick or treating\nAt least come on people\nAt least Ninety two people in twenty nine states had been infected with a strain of mold tied drug resistant salmonella\nAfter coming in contact with raw chicken products no deaths have been reported Twenty one of the patients\nHave been hospitalized at CDC warns that people could be infected by handling

believe that the body was given to a local fixer if\nParts of his remains anyway were found a at the home on the grounds of the Saudi Arabians the consul general\nCause the local six or he didn't do a very good job of fixing that if he just dumped the dump the body on the grounds of the of the Saudi Arabian or consul general the no it doesn't sound like he did a good job of of disposing of this body and that again I'm not making light of this please don't understand it please don't um misunderstand me\nIt just seems strange that you would bring so many people into killer guy when you know you do such a piss poor or just for a job of disposing the body anyway\nIn an explosive see a speech Erdogan said they were strong signs they Saudi team plotted to kill a this guy just days before his death on a October second now President Trump says you know it it very does a very much does look like she was\nA murder but he got to remember\nWe're getting all this information from a from turkey\nAnd so we also know that turkey and Saudi Arabia these to these two nations have never gotten along or at least they haven't gotten along in a in more recent history so that's going to be the question next is okay so if nobody is found\nThen how would you want President Trump to respond\nYou know yesterday he said and I think he\nHe over shot at a bit and the people are calling them out on it but yesterday President Trump said there were there were a million jobs that were attached to this hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal that we have going on with a Saudi Arabia and so now the president said it was a male and it's more like half a million but still that that's a lot of jobs it it really is\nIt so that the very awkward question that that people have to ask is this ...\nIs his murder if he was murdered I'm assuming that he is if he was murdered then you\nWant the president to cancel this arms deal you want the president to implement sanctions against Saudi Arabia and they have come out and said they will now I haven't seen that they've backed off of those earlier comments I I Know that they again have been surprised\nAt all of this backlash but they've come out and said if you sanction us You're going to be sorry because we're all absolutely up and the world economy which they can do\n\nYou know the president is doing everything he can to make sure that when he's dealing with Iran he has some flexibility in part of that flexibility is making sure that Saudi Arabia is there to help with the oil market in case\nOf Iran decides to retaliate against us we have Saudi Arabia who can bring in more oil to the market and be able to keep the prices of oil stable at the very big deal that is a very big deal\nSo there's a lot more to this they just well yeah the Saudi Arabians they they killed this guy and there are constantly in Turkey so now they have to pay its a lot more it's a lot more than that this is the world economy this is something that the president really has to think about\nAnd so now there's a number of different things that are at play here there is a world economy there's oil there is\nSanctions there is our overall relationship with Saudi Arabia\nSo we'll have to figure out what happens but the president is most certainly are not satisfied satisfied after talking to a the prints they're and Saudi Arabia about to show his death and I think part of the problem of by the way is the fact\nThat they simply are changing their story and they're changing their story um is it feels like almost every single day\nSo now the president is expressing a reluctance to lose a this this us arms sale\nOr to Saudi Arabia\nSo this is one of those situations where the president has a lot to think about on top of the fact\nThat we have here in America right now what a lot of people are calling this invasion and if the invasion of these migrants and if they make it into our country than it is going to be an invasion of illegal aliens and this is going to be a very very big problem\nHere in America now a lot of people if you use the term\nUh if you use the term invasion people get really upset and it's mostly people on the left and what I don't understand is why do get upset over a simple the simple use of a term invasion now earlier I was reading some of the quotes from some of the people that have been deported\nFrom this country from America who now embedded in this caravan\nAnd when you when you read the quotes and when you see all of these are all of these reports on TV about these these migrants that are trying to make it into our country these future illegal aliens or if you will the question has got to be asked what would you call it it's not an invasion\nBecause it was just twenty four hours after my pants implored the government\nOf Honduras and El Salvador in Guatemala and Mexico\nPlease\nAllow your people to come into our country and we're we've been employing Mexico you've got to stop these people from coming into our country and now the president\nI don't see how he does not put a our military on the border we we have we have members of the military find members of the military located all across the world\nThe time we bring them home and they watch our southern border so I've gotten more on this story and a whole lot more straight ahead here on super talk lending nine seven WGN it
