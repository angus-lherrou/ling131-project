{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "I may take me a whole season to get over that come out of the little guy you can't take the home run from the little guy anyhow we talked about candy corn how politics and polls particularly political polls reminds us of candy corn\nYou like eat one in ... and then I go I don't think I Want another one I'd kind of the same way and we talked about Halloween candy effect the matter is is that there's more money spent on Halloween in America than there are on congressional races and we've talked about the fact that\nIn those congressional races you matter [noise] now one of the ways that\nYou can get involved in an election is to be informed\nI Want to encourage you to go to voters that Congress has spent a lot of time talking to rub all get to them we will be between now and election because I've noticed that comes to free sites you can use and helps you get a lot of information doesn't cover everything doesn't get every candidate every race but it gives you a lot and it's free of charge and it's safe\nThere's no ads and there's no data mining and it's important to your informed whether you use I voters or what ever sources inside\nYou use to get information do some homework and make sure that you go out and vote that's important because when you don't show up\nAt sense a huge message to the political professionals who do politics and Marron that's America and that is that you don't care and they can do anything they darn well please and get away with it\n\nYou know a lot of the major political changes that have happened in our country have happened through the courts politicians duck the toughest issues they can\nBut they work really hard to make certain that they hold the power to control the courts and then from the courts they can do what they want to do because you don't get a vote\nIf you're upset about what you've seen in the courts and if you're upset about what you've seen in the Supreme Court hearings on Capitol and you don't vote the message that you're sending people\nIs you don't care and they can keep using power and get around every vestige of accountability to do what they want to do\nAnd in case you haven't figured it out there's a lot of folks that are in the world politics you really do think they're smarter than you are [laughter] yeah they do as a host the ... program on the public square that's heard here on WGN I can assure you I'm not smarter than on the on the stage and I might have a little edge on one or two but I'm not smarter than all folks to listen to this\nDarn too and I'm not smart I may have discovered some things that I Hope you would find interesting but I can tell you\nThe political circles they think they're smarter than where they know how to fix the problems if we just get out of the way and let them do what they need to do but they have to come back to getting your vote\nSo I voters dot coms one way you can cut through the nonsense and be empowered but there's another thing you can do if you want to make an impact on the selection\nWe've found watching the professionals who have spent billions and billions of dollars and looking at their studies and I'm an MIT technical reports we'll talk more about that tomorrow all the different research and reports that we discovered that they reveal what they're doing and how they're doing with all their high tech and other spending\nThey have discovered that the single most important way to influence an election is to get one person talking to another person about a\nCandidate or an issue that they care about all the billions and billions of dollars that they're spending their spending to do one thing is to get you to talk to somebody about the selection that you know that\nI've got in front of me the MIT technical journal\nI Will talk more about the strong it's fascinating from um just see what month was a from September October the current one I've got it right here got I've got the whole thing marked I've read through the whole thing will talk about it tomorrow\nI and I've got the report that they issued in two thousand twelve after the Obama election as well the basically chronicling the billions and billions of dollars in a high tech research that was spent to create\nThese\nGiant machines for voter outreach and voter turnout you know what they discovered at the end of all of it after all the Facebook and all the social media and all the blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah that they do\nWhat they discovered\nThat the most powerful way to bring a vote to the polls\nJust for one person to talk to another person about a candidate or an issue they believe in and encourage that person to\nThe old fashioned way is still the best in this high tech world I find that so refreshing where everything is springtime everything is who do you know social media everything is older we see the app and how many ... can I pressed on this and blah blah blah blah blah all\nOf that all the\nCommercials all the billions spent the most significant way to bring a vote changes for people to talk to people\nThat you know if I was telling you this and I'm In the business of talk and if you'd say yeah you're just doing your job no matter how this is MIT this has billions of dollars this election after election results are what you'd do really matters\nOne of the cool things about voters dot com is you can tell somebody about that too in other words it stops the argument doesn't matter whether you're a pastor and a church or whether you're a teacher whether you're a business leader we're the only company doesn't matter whether you're talking to your mailman of talking to somebody in the grocery stores will just go visit my voters dot com decide for yourself\nEvery time you encourage somebody to participate in you help empower them to make a decision to go vote it's a good thing you said oh I just want to talk to people who agree with me well you know we all get that we do\nBut I'm telling you something people voting is good for this country whether you agree with how they vote or not you\nKnow it can't be yes it is the big picture look at the constitution look at the concept of accountability no action the more we vote the better message we send to the people in power that we're watching them\nSo there is something bigger than just the immediate victory it's the long term health of the republic and accountability over our elected officials the people that started this country believe you'd be smart enough I'd be smart enough that we wouldn't forget\nThat that it's bigger than today it's bigger than a candidate a race\nIt's about the future about the past it's about the kids and the grandkids\nIt's about the health of the republic and remarkably America hasn't worn itself out the ideas that we started with still work and the power that the frame or ... put in the consent of the government and we the people it's still\nHeadline today you are still the most important key whole process who you've talked thanks for listening let's get talking more\nSuper talk Ninety nine seven WGN will be doing it

C. F. yard builders\nHenderson bail Nashville\nStudio where [laughter] I mean I\nUs Jim ... okay by my boss us as giving Saudi Arabia more time to complete an investigation either reports journalist ... G was murdered inside the Saudi embassy in Turkey two weeks ago\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and all the folks on the left one absolutely nothing to do with that\nOne of the things you have to realize and this is a headline that I've been talking about for the last couple of days Democrats fear lackluster Latino support could under cutting their bid for Congress it's just from the Washington Post now basically at least in my opinion what is happening\nIs you have the Democrats who are refusing to budge on the wall they've got Nancy Pelosi essentially mocking President Trump saying that his desire to build the wall is a man who'd issue we've got this caravan coming up through the uh through Honduras and El Salvador heading up into Mexico\nAnd so I think that what the Democrats are doing because they supposedly according to the Washington Post\nFear of this lackluster ... the teen do support they're not going to come out to the polls in the mid term elections that's what they are worried about\nSo the more that they can try and paint President Trump is somebody who once our immigration laws enforced what they're doing is they're hoping that their talking points and their narrative on the left about how President Trump continues to want to build the wall\nThey're hoping that's going to inspire the Latinos to come out to vote in the mid term elections\nNow of course we all know that there's a lot\nOf law and order Latino is out there who are looking at all these illegal aliens are coming across our border and those are immigrants those legal immigrants they are the the ones that are really angry at all the illegal aliens coming into this country\nSo I Would say that for the Democrats it it might be a bit of a a failure a strategic there if you will but we'll talk about that are coming up here on WGN so now the president as far as that four thousand strong migrant caravan continues to push north you know what it is it's almost like a snowball\nYou know what I mean by this but yeah you know how in the old cartoons you would have a snowball and then you were to roll it downhill and as the snowball rolled downhill it would get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger well that's kind of what's going on with this caravan it started out folks that a hundred and sixty\nA hundred and sixty migrants were planning to walk away from leave Honduras and and keep walking at north all the way to our border and it just keeps getting bigger and again this happens all the time this happens at least once or twice a year\nIt happened back in April and you remember and I reminded you earlier this week that when these folks were coming across our border trying to come across our border back in April we found some folks that were disguised unaccompanied minors and they were actually members of MS Thirteen\nPresident Trump warning last night he will quote call up the U.S military and close our southern border with Mexico if officials there in Mexico do not stop the northward flow of\nA growing my grand caravan that is now swelled in size to about four thousand people\nYeah he says there's a lot of criminals involved in these ah in disguise it as a caravan as well he says I'm watching the Democratic party a lead and he says because they want to open borders and existing week laws he says I'm watching the Democratic party led\nBy the Democrats assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large slowest people he says including many criminals from entering Mexico uh to the United states he tweeted that out to earlier today\nHe added in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which you know obviously he was listening to me two days ago when I implored the president to stop our foreign aid to Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala\nHe added in addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over their population the president says I must in the strongest of terms\nAsk Mexico to stop this onslaught and defined able to do so he says I Will call up the U.S military and the deed close our southern border so how it works\nIs you got Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and people are pretty much free to roam through those areas once they get into Mexico though they do have to have\nThe proper paperwork and so Mexico has said All right well if anyone with a travel documents and the correct visa\nWill be allowed to pass and others can apply for refugee status but Mexico's also warning that those who try to cross in a quote irregular manner could be detained and deported according to the Associated Press\nSo one of the things that's happened is now Mexico really is in the crosshairs right because they've got all these people that need to come through their country to make it to the United states President Trump is saying fresh off the new essentially the new NAFTA deal the president is saying you need to do something about this Mexico\nAnd Mexico they've got all these people come in through places like again Honduras and El Salvador and so now they're trying to figure out how to stop these people you know there there used to you know former President Obama and other presidents that have just said you know just come on in and this is almost an a a thing that's happened annually and you have these groups\nThat escort these migrants\nLeaving Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and they they basically guide them through Mexico all the way up into America and we've had presidents and certainly President Obama that said okay come on up\nAnd President Trump is they do more of the caravan estimated to contain about four thousand people inching Thursday towards Mexico and the Guatemalan border where Mexican officials have sent five hundred additional police officers\nAhead of its arrival according to NBC News and so yeah Mexico has said listen if you've got the proper documents the proper travel documents in the correct visa you will be allowed to pass and you can also apply for refugee status\nBut if you try to cross the regularly you're going to be sent home you can be detained you're going to be deported now there are also reporting that none of these migrants that they have spoken to who are making the journey were carrying passports so this is going to be a showdown it really is\nIf you're in Mexico what do you do you're stuck between you and I was actually listening to the United states or dealing with than or whatever raft\nEl Salvador and Honduras Guatemala can bring to you as well to me this is an easy choice to find Mexico I'm stopping all those folks who do not have passports and I'm sending their you know what home I really am\nSo they're talking about this looming showdown with Mexican border officials\nIn the coming days Mexico can stop these folks or\nThey can let them pass and if Mexico listens to what they said earlier that if you don't have travel documents or you can be or could be detained and deported see it's interesting the language they use because they don't say they will they said that they could\nSo we'll have to see what happens but if you think this is something that is an accident is really not because again you've got the Democrats and it's really a battle over illegal immigration here what I mean early voting started yesterday but we've got\nBig day coming up on whatever number six right so we've got the Democrats really trying to push\nIllegal immigration and they're trying to make it illegal immigration in this battle that we have in this country over illegal immigration into an immigration debate and it's not an immigration debate it is an illegal alien and illegal immigration debate there two completely different things and we all know that\nBut because the Democrats are fearing the Latino simple you're not going to go to the polls here in the mid term elections they're trying to make this into\nSomething that people will vote on in the midterm elections\nDemocrats are worried about Latino voters in the midterms fearing the quote week efforts to energize the core element to their base could imperil their big to win control of Congress in the elections\nThey say that President Donald Trump and the Republicans have embraced policies and rhetoric as they say hostile towards the Latino immigrants yeah this is a from my San Antonio dot com and it is interesting to the language that they use certainly in the mainstream media\nBecause my own two cents on this is I don't believe that\nThe policies of Donald Trump are hostile towards Latino immigrants but this is how it's being portrayed in the media\nThey also talked about fresh plans under consideration to a separate migrant families at the border again which the president has thrown that out there because of the fact that we have all these all these migrants caravans coming are heading north towards our border\nSo this is really what's happening now is a debate within the left itself 'cause we know that all the parties in both parties have there\nHave there debates and they have to talk amongst each other as to how they want to deal with these things and\nWe've certainly had our own battles over immigration within the Republican Party Democrats have struggled to generate enthusiasm for their candidates in some of the Hispanic community\nThe reason for that is I guess what they are working and that's what this is all about it's all about the fact that right now the economy as we know is doing really well\nSo they're talking about how some Democrats are blaming congressional campaigns and allied groups for failing to engage\nAge Latino voters strongly enough\nAh within the constant led to the parents tape recordings and video recordings of this guy's horrific murders slash slash slash execution\nIt sounds like there's a lot of evidence but the president who's been asking to see and hear the evidence doesn't have anything as of yet so he's trying to figure out\nIf so what do I do with it because right now I just don't know anything so anything official that is and that's why Mike Pompeo\nWent out any and he spoke to the south and and so now he's asking the president to give them a couple of more days to finish their investigation and their report I've got a more on this straight ahead on super talk Ninety nine seven WGN\nDan magic show you know there's a lot of a psychological benefits to losing a whole bunch of weight maybe it's the weight that

going to talk about this Wall Street journal article it's fascinating\nBecause it talks about something that I have been doing for years and it's going to baseball stadiums and this is something a hobby of mine that I've had I kid you not folks since I was probably\nFourteen or Fifteen Years old maybe even younger than that I Would go to baseball stadiums and\nI'm not afraid to tell you I'm not afraid to admit here on the radio that I have this very strange odd habit of breaking into baseball stadiums when there's not supposed to be anybody inside\nI don't know why I Do it while I Do know why do it because I have a strange fascination with stadiums and so apparently this is a thing I didn't know that it was a thing\nBut apparently the wall Street Journal has has done this whole article on people who go across the country in to see baseball and football stadium that's kind of what I Do\nNow I take it a step further and I break into the stadiums on and take it even a step further than that and I will still infield dirt or warning tractor as well and I spent years the heartbreak all get into this in detail and probably the two o'clock hour\nOne of the heartbreaking things of my life I kid you not I spent ... years\nBasically my in my entire adult a lifetime and I spent it going to baseball stadium after baseball stadium after baseball stadium breaking into the stadiums you know sneaking down onto the field\nIn Cincinnati I sent my kids down to the field that was one of those days where you could have your kids run around the infield you know it did Cincinnati is newer stadium and this was oh lord had to be eighty eight nine maybe ten years ago now\nSo I send them down there to run around the infield 'cause they wouldn't let me do it for whatever reason so they went down there\nAnd and I said our guys here's what I Need you to do and I and I gave him a little a little container kind of a thing I said you need to get down there and when you get down there I Need you to scoop ...\nSay to my ex wife was looking at me like I'm absolutely insane but whatever they did it and they went down there they ran across the bases and then when they passed that can base what did they do yeah they scooped up some dirt it was it was an awesome moment for dad\nAnd unfortunately they all got to last when I moved but you know it's like an entire lifetime of accumulating dirt from places like Wrigley Field Fenway Park Dodger Stadium\n... park for ... park if you want to you know believe Obama's prompts the pronunciation of it yeah it all got lost so upset out to get into the article at two o'clock is I I find it a just a fascinating thing\nThat people for whatever reason I'm not entirely sure why we all have this fascination with baseball stadiums\nIt's a big thing in the wall Street Journal's I'll talk about that because frankly you know I I Would rather talk about that than Nancy Pelosi however there is a lot of things to talk about it and we're going to

G but as it turns out to us we'll wait until the Saudis complete their own investigation before deciding what to do their cash\nMedia have reportage among because she'll she will seized in San Diego symbol constantly interrogated at his fingers cut off killed and then is Bonnie disposed of in pieces so we asked secretary um pail\nHere there are a lot of stories out there right now found what happened\nYeah there there ... there are there are there are there are lots of someone say there are lots of stories out there about what has happened\nIn the poll released a few weeks ago also also the timing of the poll they were asking that question if the election was held today\nNow there's a lot of time between when the poll was taken there's real quick for weeks or when the poll taken to go for the election\nYeah the the dates robber October eighth to October third teens\nAre so let me ask you this this whole project very tossing I I Know that you you know about that it was a project ... they they were able to infiltrate the brightest in campaign and\nThey caught folks on just for people who who may have missed the story and the ... folks working for the brightest in campaign saying well he's only saying what he needs to say to get elected and then once he goes to Washington DC wink wink is going to be a good Democrat\nAnd that that's pretty much what what I'd been saying and a lot of other folks have been saying all along is that the brightest in will say anything to get to Washington DC and then he'll do what a lot of politicians do and they'll just do what he wants to do so my question would be this do you think and I asked I'm\nMarsha Blackburn this yesterday and I to be perfectly candid\nYou think she answered the question so I'm gonna ask you the question\nThat the the project Vera tossed taped and and things like that\nIs that the kind of thing that will move the needle in a new election or is that such a pain in the weeds kind of a political jockeying kind of thing that it doesn't reach the moderate voter\n... and here's why there's some people who maybe said I'm going to vote for Bredesen only because I Know\nUm [noise] that he would support or oppose Kavanaugh and that's the only vested interests they had in this race so that will play to them but as a whole I don't think everyone's going to gravitate towards that but in a race that could potentially be close\nThat is something that some people are going to gravitate towards and say wait a minute that impacts what I think what he said publicly\nAgainst what he said privately\nThat that's going to resonate with some folks and they're going to they're going to take issue with that James O'Keefe from project bird toss just recently released the mother tape this week I'm On the Missouri Senate race in ... Claire McCaskill and yeah he's been a little bit of ... water\nRegarding some Planned Parenthood contributions calm and things of that nature so those tapes have they have the ability\nTo reach a segment let's face it for a British singer would hope that wasn't out there but it is and I know you know one of the black burned campaign themselves or others were going to play around with that and they're going to talk about it and we're going to make sure that people know they're saying things behind closed doors they aren't saying publicly\nClaire McCaskill just so folks down at the very latest now she's calling for investigations into that whole thing will talk about that if we have time later on I hear on the program so one of the of the things that you talked about the timing of when the poll was taken October aid to October thirteenth\nSo this was this is quite a bit of ways away from the actual election I Know that do we just started down um early voting\nBut if this thing is October eighth or October thirteenth when they're asking these questions then my question to you would be this do the numbers change do these numbers change and these percentages change\nOr the closer the we get to the actual day of voting which is a November ... and so that's one into the news changes as well it just seems like this is so far out that I don't know how relevant is\n[noise] it is far out I think what it impacts was the intent of folks and whether they intend to go to the polls it's very easily to say for weeks out I'm a hundred percent about\nIt it's easy to look at it and say that way but as you get closer we've seen the American people unfortunately with no voter turnout isn't as high as many would like to see it\nUm I think that makes a difference and has an impact on what someone does as well as when you look at the Tennessee numbers I mean those are some big numbers from the two thousand twelve United States Senate race to how the margin of Donald Trump's victory\nTo the expectation of what the bill you race in in the race for governor so the thought of having all these numbers move in one direction I was very surprised to see the Vanderbilt poll have the numbers that they did\nA ... and give British some\nHave 'em that close at this point when all the polls have said the opposite\nSo is there anything that we could take away from this poll that we should feel is credible\n[laughter] well I think you've got to look deeper look at the questions I the big thing for me is four hundred people answered a ... question and they weren't given which party the Kennedy ... the candidate a was associated with on the line with I think that is a with fifty percent of respondents were not told which party\nThe candidate was for I think that is a very large number and it makes me call into question how many of those people\nActually knew who the candidates were number one and what party they were involved with so that raises a lot of doubt for me when it comes to the pole and again I mean some people roll their eyes and look at me when I say this but the other thing is I mean it's good for Vanderbilt people were talking about Vanderbilt today they're getting their name out there talking about the older you know I Know\nAcademia loves that you know what\nThe fundraisers love the love that the polls being talked about naked they can ... so um I think that's important as well but look at the question is look at a number of calls itself the takeaway for me is four hundred fifty percent of the respondents weren't given the party identification of the people they were answering questions about\nThat kind of curious it why would they and maybe there's a method to this why would they not give the party affiliation for half the people are they losing it\nWell they they I don't know um I I think it would be so they could get ... maybe to see if there's some name identification strongly with one or the other to say oh this candidate has a lot more name identification and they know that next candidate um when you step into the voting booth half the ballots don't\nUh not include our dear our eyes next to someone's name you know which part of your voting for show the thought that they were going to do it in that way\nI Would have bought during a poll you would use a smaller sample size maybe a quarter or twenty percent of the number not give party identification but fifty percent seems like to me seems like a large number\nWas there in front of question Rob ... appreciate you being with us it was hit on baseball\nIs it on baseball stadium that's what I Want to know Saddam baseball\nNo but if you want to do it all wrote a Baker stadiums I'm all about that because people are going to get bored to death with my conversation about baseball stadiums in the next hour\n...

Christian bell\nHow she abhors the movie Snow White listen\nTo this hunch he says if you've never seen Snow White which I mean I I Can't imagine it\nAnybody who has not seen Snow White but basically she takes the bite of uh the apple from the witch and she you know goes to sleep and so the press has to kiss her to wake her up right where we all remember that movie\nSo you know what she says this is the lunacy\nOf the hash tag me too movement this is the looney or the looting us of our of our culture today and the stupidity of Hollywood\nShe says don't you think it's weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission she says when she is reading the story to her daughters because you can kiss someone if they're sleeping\nNow can I just say that when I my my kids are grown now but you know when\nMy kids were small and little and I would leave for work early in the morning I wouldn't dig Kiss My children on the forehead assault that's at my at my assaulting my ah sold my my son and my daughter when they were two and three and four years old\nThis is the lunacy\nBecause what she's doing and the three points out they'll friends the scenario as if the prince just waltz up to a sleeping woman and decided to take advantage of her when in fact his kiss saved her from the fate of the colonel sleep you know she she's\nShe's presenting the story to her daughter's like a the prints or whoever it is in Snow White slip Snow White roofing\nIt's not the case\nBut see this is the problem is she's taking the entire thing out of a contact\nAs it as a lot of men and women do it to where if you're\nIf you're leaving for the day and and your loved one is is still asleep you kiss him on the head you kiss them you know on the temple whatever I mean you you kiss them goodbye that's part of what people do so now all of a sudden\nYou know this is going to be solved this is again between cure nightly and a Christian Bale this is the stupidity that's happening\nIn Hollywood today and and I don't know\nI don't know what you do with that because I'm such a big fan of uh going out and talking about politics and and cultural things with your kids but when you're creating what I Would say when when they talk about these old stories like like Snow White and so on\nAnd they're putting it in a context that we have today and they're taking it completely out of context like the princes is slipping Snow White or a roof and he's he's taking advantage in assaulting her when she's asleep it's completely taking it out of context and it's very at least to me anyway\nIt's very one anti man into what what I Would say Kristen Bell is doing is she is instilling a fear\nAnd they'd disrespect of men in her daughter's\nAt least that's my opinion and I think this is one of the reasons why people in America today even if we're talking about something as\nI almost said something as simple as dating but I think we all know and we've talked about this before I think we all know

death of democracy hokey this Washington Post columnist who was living in Virginia he had been living here for a here in America for about a year or so and he was writing to the\nWashington Post and then he went back to turkey to take care of and and this is by well this has been coming out now a couple of days ago actually and that was that the reason why he went into that was asking why would this guy showed ...\nWhy would he know wing that the Saudis had it out for him why would he go into the into the Saudi conflict in in Turkey\nAnd apparently it was a little nervous about it well he was going there and I think I Want to say that Robert from center hill called in and gave some details on this a couple of days ago he he was going there because\nHe was wanting to get married and so he had to make sure that his first divorce was final before he married his\nHis fiance who by the way was as we all know waiting outside of the er at the consulate there in in Turkey when he was

apparently according to fiance and some other folks I she was told okay here's my cell phone and if anything weird happens you know called these people and they'll try and in and help and and so\nHe knew that he was going into kind of a risky situation\nAnd we all know unfortunately but apparently has now happened so now we know that secretary of state Mike Pompeo just to\nGet you updated with

me and a different person also made a personal commitment to the president when he spoke to him believe it was the night before last [laughter]\nYeah so that the big question is ultimately who are you going to believe\nRight because you've got the Saudis that are out there trying to figure out and and I think what what they're trying to do is they're trying to come up with a story that is plausible enough that basically the world than in Donald Trump or will believe he also by the way talked about to the Turkish investigation\nWhen I travel and met with President aired on a feed talk to me about the incident he told me that they were conducting their own investigation\nUh we had a chance to meet with some of the team involved with your shirt as if they would share their results with ah the Saudis as well um so we do believe that between these two efforts a complete picture will emerge for what actually transpired here\nWhy I I think we have a pretty pretty complete picture\nOf fingers being chopped off one by one and what ... happened to\n... shortage now one of the other things that that we need to talk about and then we had been talking about is the fact that we've had as we all know this long lasting relationship which Saudi Arabia and I I talked about this yesterday I talked about how this\nThis is literally a world changing decision with President Trump about how he handles ah this whole\nMurder of ... ... it is a world changing event if they've got all these folks are in the media who are really trying to pin down President Trump or trying to get him to answer one way or another as to how he's going to handle this guy's murder\nI think it's important for all the member to my ... long since Nineteen thirty two all along strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that continue to be important counterterrorism partner or they have custody of the\nTwo holy sites are there and important strategic alliance of the United states we need to be mindful of that as well yeah\nSo the president is in a a really tough position because he he wants to keep that relationship alive he wants to make sure that he is able to conduct business with Saudi Arabia but when they do something as abhorrent\nAs murder this guy could show you just said this journalist from the Washington Post when you murder this guy and murder him in cold blood and in such a reprehensible way\nThan there really is for this hour for the Saudi Arabia is there is no way out of this I mean they have audio apparently the or that the Turks have audio they have video of this guy's last seven minutes and so now we're in a situation where the president has to decide okay\nI Need to figure out a way so that I can preserve the relationship with the Saudi Arabians but still make it make it look like I take this seriously\nAnd so that's a very difficult position because for a number of reasons the president has to really walk the line on this\nHe really needs to figure out a politically expedient way to maneuver around this I mean when you look at one how horrific this guy this guy's murder was and it was horrific\nAnd I don't feel the need to you know dwell on all the horrific things that they did to this guy and when I was talking about how I'm looking at my Twitter feed I mean everywhere there is details of what this guy went through and what his last seven minutes we're like\nAnd when you talked about how the uh the royal family there in Saudi Arabia or they knew this guy was coming to town and they knew that he was going to be in their embassy and they brought in what for like Fifteen assassins\nThey brought in over a dozen people that were experienced that this kind of poetry I mean good lord how many I mean how many of these guys have to take to in a kid to kill one you know one um one journalist\nSo now that's the situation with the president okay Mike Pompeo saying that we need to give the the Saudi Arabians more time to figure out how they want to handle this and I think what they're trying to do is get their story straight\nThat's ultimately what they're trying to do is is\nThe Saudis have to figure out how are we going to get out of this and how we're going to also get to President Trump off the hook here because if you think about it they put the the the Saudi Arabians have put Donald Trump President Trump in a horrible position\nThe reason why they put ... Donald Trump and horrible position is because literally the world is out there and they're they're waiting for the president to make some sort of an announcement as to what it is that day he is going to do regarding the murder of of Jamal a show\nNow his final column is also come out and and ironically enough his final ... uh his final a commentary there in the Washington Post revealed his demand for stronger protections for a free press in\nThe Arab world and so a lot of people and I I read this or as well it almost seems like he knew that he wasn't going to be coming back he was nervous\nAbout going into the conflict there in Turkey he really was he had been there once before and and the folks there in the conflict said you know what we need you to come back in ... you know a week or so because we need to get all the proper paperwork in order to make sure that your first\nYour first marriage is completely over so that you can marry your new fiance and that's why he was there\nSo that's the problem that he was facing is he wanted to move on with his life and so\nHe knew he could be enforced something horrific\nAnd so this now is it's almost like a a column from a from the grave for this guy the colon from show gives assistant or was turned in by his assistant to kind of came the day after he was reported missing so he wrote it he gave it to his assistant and then the day after he was reported\nSing she turned it over to the Washington Post they'd withheld different publication until now in hopes of going through the editing process with the rider cars show game self\nBut his final call him is as they described as straightforward call for greater press freedom in Arab countries\nAnd demand that the rest of the world hold the region's governments accountable for attacks on journalists now here's what's interesting and I'm not trivial rising what happened to this guy could show ... it's a horrible thing\nBut how many times have we seen people in in the media decry President Trump and how the president has been you know essentially calling for violence against journalists here in America\nZip recruiter is the right way now what you should not do is go through some of these other job sites that are not zip recruiter\nAnd some of these other sites and you know this\nThey'll send you a ton of resumes from people simply not qualified for the job that you have available or you make they make you wait for the right person to come along well that's simply not smart which zipper critter does is they go after the white people for you to go out and just like in their name they recruit\nThat go out and do find the people that are most qualified for the position that you need to fill they don't depend on candidates finding you yeah it goes out and find them for you\nYeah they've got this powerful matching technology they scanned thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills the right education the right experience for your job and actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates quickly you want to check them out right now it zipped recruiter dot com slash manned as\nThey rated number one by employers in the United states and right now my listeners can try zip recruiter absolutely free at this exclusive Web address zip recruiter dot com slash mantis zip recruiter dot com slash manned is it ... reporter the smartest way to hire [noise]\nFallout from up August we're enjoying report the detailed allegations are priest sex abuse in Pennsylvania sources tell the Associated Press the Justice Department does know opened an investigation and serve subpoenas own diocese across the state\nOf Texas grand juries indicted former USA Gymnastics presidents Steve Penny on what's believed to be an attempt to cover up for disgraced former team doctor Larry Nassar correspond to ...\nThe indictment alleges penny ordered the removal of documents from the Karolyi Ranch in Huntsville relating to Nassar's activities that the one time training facility for USA Gymnastics to impair the investigation ended in our prisons Nassar\nThe Walker County Texas district attorney's office says ... he was arrested by a fugitive task force in ...

coming up next\nAt a three oh sex and one of the things that I'd been absolutely focused on it and the reason why is it\nIt's so important and that is the fact that we have these these Honduran migrants that are looking to come into the country and they're going to come into the country illegally and now the president is trying to decide what to do about this caravan\nNow if you don't think this is politically motivated absolutely it is and the guy actually sent me a note\nOn the damage to our Facebook page and and he asked the question and the question was\nIs George Soros behind this migrant caravan and I would say why yes George Soros in my opinion is partially perhaps behind this a migrant care of and it's so if you've been if you're not up to speed on the story let me just say it very quickly what's happening\n[noise] we've got people from Honduras we've got people from El Salvador we have people from Guatemala and what they're doing is they're coming to the United states in a huge group is like it's like they're trying to make a point\nAnd the point they're trying to make is doggone it we are not going to respect your border we have human rights and we should simply be allowed to come into America\nNow this has been something that's been going on for quite some time and and past president frankly have simply allowed them to come in and so ultimately what that did thank you President Obama is that led to even more illegal aliens coming into the country and it also led to a resurgence of MS Thirteen\nNot to blame but the point I've talked about this before I'm no doubt we'll mention it again MS Thirteen where do they come from El Salvador the last time we saw big caravan of migrants coming into this country\nAs they were making their way from Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala through Mexico heading north when they started asking these folks okay who are you and why do you want to come into this country yeah they found a couple of them are Thirteen gang members\nSo this is important this is the safety of our nation and there was a forest thousand of them\nThere for thousands strong they have no passport they have no papers they just want to [noise] knock on our border and\nComment and I don't know about you but I don't like that so now the president has the decision to make does\nHe call in the U.S military and literally close the southern border to make sure that these four thousand strong this migrant caravan does not make it into our country and folks this is what I've been saying all along\n", "year": "2018", "show_name":
