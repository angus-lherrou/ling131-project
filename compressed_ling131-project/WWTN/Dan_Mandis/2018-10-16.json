I Love what she says\nShe says I've spent Fifteen Years in the trenches knife fighting and gosh it's funny I just don't remember seeing you there Michael ... winning elections is about more than just talking tough on Twitter and it TV\nSent strategist are saying I've been out of his tone towards establishment Democrats has been largely on unhelpful to a splintered Democratic Party but that is pretty much what a Trump did right I mean Trump came in and\nWe he he had what sixteen or so of the other candidates there in the Republican primary and man he just picked him off one by one\nIf he wants to run he should be focused on building coalitions instead of demeaning people who spent their lives in public service men is just sounds exactly like the Republicans when President Trump announced that he was going to run\nOne last comment here from the very worried Democrats many of us are content at your work behind the scenes that'd be advocates for good people and good policy\n...\nGood people and good policy I'm not exactly sure if that's what\nI Would say the Democrats are all about yeah you know did you just hear that actually hit [noise]\nBrian Wilson spell I've got to get this way for me I'll be doing that all damn day\nOr by the way some make America great again news headline us employers post a record number of open jobs in August\nSee this is what it's all about folks say somewhere my stack of stuff man it's twelve fourteen I've got so much as so many stories to tell you about today\nKind of fired up about it all at a great day yesterday us employers post a record number of open jobs in August\nAnd this is the same economic growth that we've been seeing\nUs employers posted the most jobs in two decades in August in hiring also reached a record high fresh evidence that companies\nAre desperate to staff up amid solid economic growth there's a story I have about how the Democrats you know they're they're big fear is because the Democrats they're fearing a lot\nAnd some of their biggest fears one is that the black folks aren't going to come out and vote for whoever is going to be the I'm the nominee for the Democrats and also they're worried about the Hispanic votes\nSo whether we're talking about the mid term elections or we're talking about the presidential election of twenty twenty if the economy continues where it is while I hate to say say there's actually I Love to say this but it's the economy stupid and it is\nJob openings rose a slight zero point eight percent to seven point fourteen million the highest on records dating back to December of the year two thousand\nSo this is huge Donald Trump of course celebrating the report on Twitter tweeting out just a little bit ago incredible number just out astonishing he says it's all working\nAnd he talks about strong profits and all these other kinds of things so here's what we know and I don't want to beat you down right now with a whole bunch of of micro numbers here's what you need\nTo know whether you are white black Latino a male female you name it if you want a job you can find a job folks\nAnd to me that is going to underscore everything that the president is doing\nWhether we're talking about the decimation of ISIS whether we're talking about the attempt the decimation of MS Thirteen there is some big MS Thirteen news out there today because of the fact\nThat that Jeff Sessions has now come out and said that\nThe Trump Administration is working towards a plan to finally read eradicate re eradicate I had the uh the the vicious MS Thirteen getting I almost had ice you know it is interesting when you talk about ISIS enemies Thirteen\nThey they do have a two one thing in common both of these a deadly groups\nAre they both are really liberated under former President Obama's so when I say that President Trump is trying to reach eradicate MS Thirteen well don't forget and I've talked about this at ... pm when Obama was an office MS Thirteen they were pretty much eradicated until\nObama allowed the essentially open borders policy and then all of a sudden we had all of these uh supposedly unaccompanied minors you remember that and then all of a sudden in the last years of the Obama administration and less Thirteen they started to reemerge andme reemerged in a big way\nSenator Jeff Sessions is out there and he's trying to do and he's working with President Trump of course and they're working to really do whatever they can\nTo combat MS Thirteen so ah they're hiring a bunch of new people they've got to it's essentially a guy who's going going to be in charge of a eradicating MS Thirteen so we have that story as well by the way you may have been hearing about this or another huge migrant caravan\nIs formed in the Honduras with the aim of reaching\nThe U.S border this is such a it's a couple of things\nIs is the same thing that we saw back in what ways of April where you've got all of these activist groups and so what they do is they just all get together and they decide that they're going to take that long slow walk us through ... through Mexico up to the U.S border and it is it's a couple of things\nIt's a big publicity ploy it's a publicity you know whatever you want to say they're trying to make a point\nBut the other thing that this is is it's a big middle finger to Donald Trump to Mike Pence who was literally\nJust there and imploring the government do not assist your people in leaving your country and coming to ours ... actually said that he tried to strike a\nDeal with the ah folks out there the government in Honduras the very next day this caravan was formed and here they come what does that tell you\nThat tells you that you've got these activist groups and they want to do whatever they can to get it as much publicity as they can out of this and this is part of what they do but the other thing that they're doing is they're trying to make a point\nThere trying to make a point that we have absolutely here in America we have absolutely no right to our own sovereignty to our own border control\nA group of more than one thousand migrants are formed in Honduras with the aim of trucking through Mexico to the U.S border defying warnings from Trump Administration officials not to attempt the Perilous Journey now with a tie this end of the\nUh MS Thirteen situation because as we've talked about before last time this happened in April what happened they they found a bunch of ah some MS Thirteen gang members within that particular migrant caravan as well again back in April what five four or five months ago whatever it's been now\nSo this is these these\nMigrant caravans when you've got sixteen hundred people that are making their way out of Honduras and Mexico and indeed the United states and all of this is aided by Honduras and Mexico and El Salvador and some of these other places\nThey're essentially helping these people get into the United states in Mexico while they have helped some they haven't helped a whole\nHeck of a lot and now the president is going after Mexico big time and we'll talk about that straight ahead on super talk Ninety nine seven W T and\nIt is a dead man do show and if you need a new gun new firearm I've got great news for you teach him calls\nCan hook you up just in time for prime hunting season

and El Salvador and let's utilize that to pay for more law enforcement\nWhere MS Thirteen is rampaging that sounds like a good price so that sounds like a good idea to me\nMost of those numbers are

I mentioned it a turkey in the United states and I'm just calling a bunch of different stories together or we have now are inspected the conflict there and uh there were apparently some cleanup\nThat was done inside the consulate so they're wondering\nWhy why does it smell like a you know cleaning agents here and why is there a fresh coat of paint over here and you know all these things as a finger on the floor why is there a finger on the four that's exactly right they'll do not make light of this it's not it there's really not it's not funny that that's best producer bell send era\nHostile emails to a producer ballot a WPN\nSo a lot of folks including the Washington Post analyzing this whole situation with Elizabeth Warren now what are the things that I've got to ask you is is\n\nWe know that Elizabeth Warren has done zero for quote unquote hurt people I spend a lot of time in the last hour talking about the fact that there are those in the Native American communities including by the way they do the Cherokees\nWho want nothing to do with Elizabeth Warren as I get what you may want to claim us but we're not claiming you\nBecause you haven't done digitally or squad enforcing the you know and all the time you've been in Congress right\nSo this is the situation now where there's a lot of Native Americans again including the Cherokees who were calling Elizabeth Warren out again one one thousand twenty fourth Native American that's what she is so clearly she's been trying to claim that she is something that she's not for political reasons\nDoes that ring a bell\nDoes that ring a bell with a lot of Democrats these days so partisan a guy who claims to be somebody who will reach across the aisle but clearly doesn't and won't and won't even admonishing his own staffers\nAfter calling Republicans all kinds of names we've covered that story the project very top story we've been talking about that for ... days folks\nSo Phil Bredesen pretending to be a a a moderate who will not a couch to Chuck Schumer even though we know that Chuck Schumer is given him a ... not over a million dollars from the Democrats for Phil Bredesen\nSo there's another example of a Democrat who is claiming to be something lying to get your vote Cory Booker claims to be an advocate for women in this whole hashtag MeToo environment yet he himself\nAdmits to grow the woman in college Richard Blumenthal another Democrat claiming to be a Vietnam veteran when he wasn't\nAt Hillary\nClaiming to be a champion of women and women's rights when guess what she tried to destroy those who accused bill of rape and sexual harassment I mean listen folks\nThis is what the Democrats do [noise]\nI I tell you what the dishonesty and politics and this is what this is exactly what President Trump men are meant when he said that the the the swamp had to be drained\nBecause this is the ... this is what happens\nThe lying and the misrepresentation that we're seeing over and over again oh by the way next uh tomorrow\nAt two o five were going to have a Marsha Blackburn will be joining the radio program going to talk about all kinds of things with her and and and most certainly the project Vera tossed tape\nMay come up during that conversation headline Democrats or a lackluster Latino support could under ... bid for Congress now a just a very to my stack of stuff here we had some very good economic news or over the past year it is\nHeadlined us employers supposed to record number of open jobs in August us employers posted the most jobs in two decades in August in hiring is also reached a record high\n\nSo I Want you to think about this as we're sitting here talking about the Democrats and how they they like to misrepresent who they are to try and finagle votes one of the other things that the Democrats just love to do is not only misrepresent themselves but they also like to misrepresent Republicans\nCase in point\nWe're all a bunch of racist we're all a bunch of ... we're all a bunch of bullies you see how for the for the Democrats it's like their entire platform is based on lies and in misleading statements and characterizations\nMeantime you've got President Trump most of his branding there's truth behind one percent Joe was what he got during his two times when he ran for president Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren a lot of truth behind that is there any truth to Republicans being called racists\nNo of course not\nLast time I checked the good economy was good for everybody not just white folks not just old white people not just old white Republicans no everybody\nAnd so I think that when I saw the headline from my San Antonio dot com Democrats fear lackluster Latino support could undercut bid for Congress well you know why that is it's because the Democrats\nWhat they do is they have essentially no no basis for their attacks on Republicans it's like how could you possibly vote for racist like Donald Trump really\nHow was Donald Trump or a racist\nBecause it seems to me like enforcing immigration laws is something that are not only\nIs something that most uh or if not all of Americans want while most Americans one but also some of the some of the Americans who are very much advocates for border security are those immigrants who came into our country legally\nSo I think where the Democrats are really going wrong they don't understand\nThe Latino community and they don't understand I Would say what's happening here in America because while they're calling the Democrats are are calling President Trump a racist and decrying all of these you know parents and children are being ripped apart and separated non all these other things\nThat's what the Democrats are are thinking well bring out the the Latino support the truth of the matter is that our economy is doing really well\nAnd because of our economy's doing really well and we've got a record number of job openings in August than those Latinos are not going to\nI come out in the mid term elections and vote for Democrats because they recognize a good thing when they see one you know what else and that sort of a policy attacks re foreign policy that as we all know is creating jobs here in America\nIt's also not forget the tax reforms where are we got a whole bunch of people that are getting more money back in their taxes and they're getting bonuses at work again that's not an old white male thing\nAnd they're like you to join them in bringing in the fall season\nI've rented twin creeks village what they're doing is they're offering you a

writer at national joke\nShe says we all know why Adam ... says it all on on him on Twitter courses where all of our important dialogue happens in America today is on Twitter\nElizabeth Warren's response we all know why at real Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about me right he's scared\nHe's trying to do what he always does two women who scare him call his name's attack us personally shrink it down to feel better about himself\nIt may suit his ego but it won't work\nSo she really bringing up a whole lot hash tag meat you into this\nIt sounds like that at least to me that's what she's doing and in fact what is it the Yahoo\nYahoo reports the quote unquote creepy debts a description carries extra meaning during the nation's reckoning with sexual misconduct in the hashtag MeToo era\nAnd they talked about how more than a dozen women have accused him of sexual misconduct blah blah blah so first I don't think you have to be a you know creepy in this whole hashtag MeToo era I think I think there can fighting up or whatever but the bottom line is is\nIs that if Elizabeth Warren is trying to turn this into a whole ... thing it it's not really surprising\nBecause she really has nowhere else to go when you look at the amount of people\nFor the Democrats who are vying to run in a against Trump twenty twenty you've got a lot of people there you've got Cory Booker Kamala Harris you have a Elizabeth Warren you have a whole bunch of other folks as what Joe Biden is another one Hillary is still out there\nSo that's going to be the question\nIs will the Democrats\nFroze their ... considerable way behind Elizabeth Warren\nBecause as I said a couple of times now this Elizabeth Warren never was going to be able to convince Donald Trump\nAbout her heritage who she is trying to convince is Democrats and voters in it moderates and independents that's who this whole DNA testing was all about and it was also about could she\nAs somebody who was a you know a Democrat with a very high profile could she figure out a way\nTo essentially\nTake this whole Pocahontas branding off the table and so that was her goal okay so if I take the DNA tests I'll prove that I I Do have some heritage and made some uh some Native American heritage in me and I can completely disarmed the president instead clearly at least in my opinion she made it worse\nSo now she's trying to make it into a whole hashtag me to think that talking about how this is what President Trump always does two women who scare him call us names attack us personally shrank us down to feel better about himself it may suit his ego she tweets but it won't work so\nYou know that that is a Elizabeth Warren's\nA response that I guess all of this there's a lot of people that have gone back and forth on Twitter and I I Try and follow it as\nA best I can as we are covered this for you every single day but man they are just flying a fast and furious one of the things that that I saw 'em over the last twenty four hours or so\nOr one of my favorite to commentators is Tucker Carlson and we all know what's been happening across America with a lot of these that conservative commentators\nIs that they are literally under attack\nSo Tucker talked about um talked about his experience here the last couple of days\nHe was on business insiders ignition a conference and he was he was just having a conversation about this uh these very emboldened attacks on Republicans and you know what he says he says that he can't even go out to dinner anymore\n\nBecause every time he does he has attacked by a lot of these lunatics on the left now he says it's so many people are literally shouting curse words at him in public that it's nearly impossible for him to eat out\nI Know that there's a lot of people that are you know saying well\nHe's Tucker Carlson and he can have better food at home and he can afford to you know have a he's a chef and all these other things you know sometimes you just want to go out\nSo this is one of those instances where are we keep finding out the the very radical left is doing whatever they can to try and disparage and\nDestroyed not only the Trump Administration but also conservative commentators and for Tucker Carlson he says that ah there's only one restaurant that he can still go to and not have somebody screamed F for you\nIf I remember right he's got a couple of small kids to detonate Tucker Carlson I think that he does so that's also one of the reasons\nThe job was dangerous when he took it yet he he went back he he went

G.\nAnd an entire nation was stunned they really were and so the Democrats I think they've got a little bit of a pea TST from twenty sixteen and so they're really nervous now\nBecause they don't really know what to expect in part of the problem that the Democrats have\nIs the fact that they've got and I I was just watching Fox News of a few moments ago and they were talking about how there's a lot of people are within the Democrats who are really angry at Elizabeth Warren and some of these other folks\nWho are how would you say this\nThey're losing focus the Democrats are losing focus right now they should be focused on the midterm elections but what happens\nYou've got um you've got the ... as as a prank call through today polka dot if yeah that's what Brian I ... I I I think that was Brian's a moniker but a bottom line is you got ... out there who is\nA really grabbing all the headlines\nAnd so while the Democrats should be focused on what they want to do in the mid term elections there really it seems to me on on damage control right now is the only way that I could explain to them how exactly it is that they're conducting themselves here in the mid term elections\nAnd so they started talking about how in this article in the hill about how Democrats are nervous because they don't really know what to expect\nThey say that it was this week two years ago that Hillary's victory looked a short in the presidential election when the infamous Access Hollywood tape of Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault\nAppeared all but certain to end his campaign\nThen we all know what happened and I think that's why the Democrats right now they are incredibly nervous and you know what honestly\nThey should be nervous because there there was a lot of folks in the party in their party who didn't see what was coming in twenty sixteen it's almost like the one guy that did see this whole thing coming was Donald Trump\n\nAnd if you others as well so we'll have to see what happens but I did love the headline which was that the Democrats are worried because ah they may be surprised and they may realize that they way overplayed\nOr the cabin offing and I think that's why they are um they're nervous now think about it this way you've got Donald Trump and uh we know everything with a P tape and all that kind of stuff right so so we don't have to go into that any more\nBut I think that one of the things that happened in twenty sixteen was the fact that the Democrats way overplayed their hand with a P tape you remember that I remember that day like it was yesterday when that whole thing came out\nAnd people were freaking out actually had a radio show that day in Washington DC and I got to tell you people were absolutely appalled at what they heard on that tape\nAnd as I was listening to the tape and I was listening to the anger and the the the the mortified voices of people in Washington DC inside the swamp\nWho said there's absolutely no way Donald Trump should be president of the United states because of that tape and I listened to person after person after person and I I'm thinking to myself and I said it a few times you got some got some hate tweets if I remember right certainly got some hate emails\nAnd I and I said listen voter however you want but you need to think about this\nWhat is the actually saying there you you need to dissect the tape and I did dissect the tape and the president what the president was referring to was essentially consensual grabbing\nNow is it the wrong thing for the president test to say whatever he was caught on tape and it aired but I think the what we do know is that for the Democrats they did way overplayed\nThat hand and and when they lost the election of twenty sixteen I think one of the things that they did\nWas they realized a couple of things one was that they overplayed that hand but the other thing was that they they also overplayed the fact that the Trump supporters are a bunch of deplorable we remember that as well\nSo fast forward now to October sixteenth of twenty Eighteen we're heading straight into the midterm elections the question is is\nDid the Democrats overplay the Kavanaugh saying just like they overplayed\nPie tape I say yes I think the majority of the people here in America saw this whole thing play out and all of this out and out hysteria\n\nWith Christine Blasey Ford and judge Kavanaugh on I think most people who were of their right mind look it looked at that whole situation and said God these Democrats are crazy\nNow these are thirty plus year old allegations there's no proof and you know we we all know the story line\nAnd so there's people now that are that are political pundits that are far smarter than me they're looking at this whole thing and thinking boy you know they they may have way overplayed that hand especially when you look at some of the polls and some of the polls came out to it at the time you know just a few weeks ago\nAnd they said that there were some Americans many Americans who felt like the Democrats were of placing way too much importance on what Christine Blasey Ford add to say because there was nothing to indicate the capital actually did this\nNot to mention a so that's the over playing part of my comparing a twenty Eighteen to twenty sixteen now what about the name calling\n'cause that was also a big part of twenty sixteen let's not forget that the Democrats for whatever reason\nYou know bless their hearts they just cannot get out of their own way because every time you turn around they're calling you to President Trump or people to support President Trump or Republicans generally speaking as some sort of a name\nYou know if you're a supporter Brett Kavanaugh's and guess what you are somebody who was siding with rapists\n\nAnd I think that most people who are not part of the lunatic fringe the people on the left I I think if if you had even half a right mind\nYou understood that they were blowing that situation way out of proportion and way out of context and so I think that's why the Democrats if this article in the hill is correct\nI think that's what the Democrats absolutely should be nervous I think that that's why the Democrats are absolutely worried that there could be another election day disaster about to strike and if you think they are\nUpset now if you think they're going crazy now if you think they are ... at the mouth now wait till you see them if the end up ah without control of the house of representatives can you imagine that\nCan you imagine if Republicans I keep hold of the house how amazing that would be\nI mean I Want to take control of the house or ... keep control of the house for many reasons but one of the big ones is just to see the liberal heads explode but what we don't want\nWe don't want the final two years of Trump's first term to hit a stone wall hit a brick wall there in the house of

[noise]\nI don't know why I find this story fascinating on the one hand and on the other hand are really really anger fine Amy Schumer\nNow for the record I could give to whatever's about anything that Amy Schumer has to say we know that or she is somebody who is a very much on the left and you know she's what I Would say part of the a lunatic a left in Hollywood\n\nBut she says she feels really bad for hot women here's what she says she says that being a woman\nSucks what she says here's why\nVery difficult she says and and something else that we've all ... just like we are sexual wise like all the time even when it seems crazy Raleigh\nFactual wise so I feel really bad for these girls who were so hot because guys can't handle it you can't have a conversation everything's going to skew sexual and you're going to be treated differently and honestly I actually feel really bad for them\nSo on the one hand she feels sorry for hot and women because uh guys we we we'd Neanderthal guys simply cannot handle being around hot women because suddenly we're just going to start rambling about sex is that what it is\nI'm reasonably certain that that's not true\nIt's almost like a ... Amy Schumer feels like in this all due respect to people who have to rest but I mean it's almost like she's intimating that guys will just getting to some sort of hypnotic threats like trance whenever they're around a beautiful woman and they're just going to start talking about sex\nBut wait till you hear what else she has to say that this is this is why are the left I I think that they're in for at some point\nThey're going to end up I'm\nLosing a lot of votes because of just this kind of attitude\nShe says there's also the women that feels so on attractive that they're just invisible she says it just sucks anyway by the way if you're a woman and and you have an opinion on what Amy Schumer has to say I would love to hear if if this is true if you're a quote unquote hot woman\n\nCan you not have a conversation with the guy before he Neanderthal English you like it goes into you know some sort of a weird you know a conversation about sex our guys really that bad\nActually truly asking that question because I've had lots of conversations with pretty women over the years and I haven't you know somehow skewed the conversation towards sex\nBut see this is what the left du da da and this is what the snowflakes do is they try and paint something where they are always the victim and this is I Would say just another one of those instances six one five seven three seven deadly WGN women has that been your experience I Am I'm generally kind of curious\nAnd no one not doing that just so I can talk to pretty women Nobel that's not what I was trying to do\nSmart out anyway so she says it yeah there are so many women who feel so unattractive there are simply invisible so it it kind of a sex for them as well and so then they started talking about uh whether or not she would change her own appearance and she says no I wouldn't I wouldn't change a thing\nThey also took a moment by the way and this is where it gets a little frustrating they also took a moment to talk about how women are constantly afraid they are in danger of getting sexual assault to listen to this\nShe says women are mostly scared of violence because you know one in six women reports being sexually assaulted but really\nIt's one in three women where does she get that from you know listen women are being sexually assaulted and we know that but let's not make it\nEven worse by taking the statistics and blowing them out of proportion I I don't know where she gets one and three women but this is again what they do so she says women are mostly scared of violence because you know one in six women reports being sexual assault but really", "show_name": "Dan Mandis", "year": "2018", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "16"}
