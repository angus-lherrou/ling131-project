getting what they need President Trump is torn barriers to Florida in Georgia that were hit by hurricane Michael\n\nAnd brightest and allowed them to get away with it as a matter of fact he hired these two guys uh to work on his campaign his current campaign\nSo we know that person has issued standing up to the people who are doing things that are wrong whether it's his former staffers who are engaged in sexual harassment away back then as a matter of fact he hired them back\nTo these uh employees in his campaign currently talking about how his supportive judge Kavanaugh was nothing but a ruse to this guy mark brown\nWho months ago we reveal to you here on the radio station but it was it was everywhere about how he had all these negative nasty things to say about Donald Trump and are people who voted for and support for Donald Trump can about Donald Trump and about how there was absolutely no way that they should reach across the aisle\nHe said that President Trump has a F ing moron and a racist and he also called the Trump putting the word you remember all this yeah this is the same guy\nSo then he comes out and and again he said well all the people on the tape this is how could they started blowing up and then he said well these are all just unpaid interns and volunteers well then it turns out not to be the case because they found all these guys are and women on the payroll for the party so yeah he's been caught in it\nOther why now here's another one white male gun nuts are the biggest terrorist organization on the planet yeah that's one of the fight postings of mark brown\nFrom way back way back in what is it twenty Fifteen\nThis is according to the Washington Free beacon now one of the things that I think that we should all except and understand is that when you surround yourself with people who think like this\nWell then what does that say about you\nAnd your own belief system\nAnd when you don't distance yourself from these comments and when you don't make a comment to clarify some of these insane comments from this spokesperson for the Democrats here in the state of Tennessee well then the only conclusion that I can\nDraw is that you two Phil Bredesen feel like quote unquote white male gun nuts are the biggest terrorist organization on the planet\nHere's the story and again this is from the free beacon a spokesman for the Democratic group that is supporting former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen and his run for the U.S Senate seat referred to quote white male gun owners\nAs a gun nuts in response to a Facebook post asking people to identify quote the biggest terrorist organization on the planet now this was in twenty Fifteen\nNow think back to twenty Fifteen you know we've got ISIS going on we've also got 'em\nI'll ... going on as well we've got all kinds of terrorist organizations\nYet this guy talks about white male gun nuts yep\nMark brown communications director for the uh Tennessee victory twenty Eighteen again from the free beacon a group backing brother the reticence run against a U.S representative Marsha Blackburn for the Senate seat occupied by retiring Republican Bob Corker posted the comment in twenty Fifteen\nWhite male gun nuts this is what the Democrats think of you and again the free beacon is pointing out and uh I appreciate the fact that they are pointing out what we've been talking about for a long time\nThese past comments also made by ... by mark brown it was not the first time brown made incendiary comments about Republicans\nAnd enjoy thirty first twenty Seventeen post brown allegedly wrote exactly F reaching out to Trump voters the idiots or not listening and again you know their posts he has referred to President Trump is putting the word racist\nF stick I forgot about that one [laughter] I did I forgot\nAbout it I don't know why I did I also called him an F ing moron and an insane after it's quite the vocabulary for a spokesperson I Would say and even the the freebie can points out browser brazen approach\nIs it odds with Brett is and who is painted himself as a painted himself as a moderate willing to reach across the aisle\nSo yeah there you know this is one of those stories that I'm for whatever reason I think that the media\nLocally is simply not covering is uh this guy mark brown and the fact that he lied about these quote unquote volunteers and these are unpaid interns or whatever it is that you want to call it\nI had a hard time finding the clarification ... what I found is a whole bunch of stories talking about how it almost like it was a dead end where the end of the story and this is what I Love about the media right\nThe end of the story\nFor most of the media was mark brown the Democrats say that um you know these are all just a bunch of interns and and whatever and and volunteers and there's nothing more nothing less of this story so it's not credible the project very toss tape but selective editing\n\nHow many aside from Fox Seventeen are playing you at the audio of mark brown admitting that he lied\n[laughter] than fighting for things that they're young intern than ever to suffering here\nThinking or understand how that\nWorks and how that can do yeah yeah and and again I thought we were attempting to mislead anyone brown\nSaid when I asked him about those in the video he told the truth the reference those in the background not those talking\nFor our but there are several other people in the video they like the background and other places who are probably volunteers [noise]\n[laughter] I just I I don't know I watched the project ... tape and so it it's hard for me I I I Do I have to struggle at the fact that this guy is saying well it was the people in the background you know\nWalking down the hallway making a pot of coffee making his Xerox copy maybe some people on the phone I mean doesn't it can't just be me right\nI mean that's just it it sounds so incredibly silly anyway so that is the latest on the brightest in campaign it just feels now like the the uh the campaign of of of Phil Bredesen is just is floundering and they can't get out of their own way\nYou know whether you're talking about what a brown said in the in the allies\nTo the media regarding the project very tossed tape or this whole white male gun that's what the biggest terrorist organization on the planet which is what he said back in it twenty Fifteen I I just it is astonishing to me I mean ask you this\nEven if you're a ... supporter\nAnd I'm not but even if you're a ... supporter or if you're an independent and you're trying to make up your mind between two candidates\nPhil Bredesen or Marsha Blackburn\n\nI Would think that just based on the lives that are coming from a British ... campaign and the name calling that are coming from a British since camp\nEven though he himself is is not engaged in on this I think it's pretty clear that he is accepting it I think it's very clear that he is allowing it\nIs that the kind of person that you want running the state of Tennessee somebody who doesn't have the the ability to hold his own\nPeople accountable how is he going to be accountable\nTo the people of Tennessee if he ends up the uh as our senator\nOne of our senators we can't possibly allow that to happen here really think that if if Bredesen is elected to the Senate he's going to be able to hold Chuck Schumer and the Democrats accountable\nNow he can't even hold his own campaign accountable he can't even hold mark brown accountable\nSo I don't know what's going on with the brightest in or his campaign\nBut it seems to me they're in an absolute spiral and you know my two cents on a good you know like Marsha Blackburn don't like Marsha Blackburn some people like or some people don't like her but you know what\nAt least we know who she is at least we know what she's done and in my opinion in opinion anyway I like what she has to say so\nThat is at the very latest on all of that coming up next I Do and talk about this whole us that this whole reporter for the NATO a columnist for the Washington Post\nAnd how he is now a been missing for what a week or two weeks

let those those folks do store owners are those restaurant owners know that the mob mentality that they experience whether on social media the phone calls you get whatever\nThat is make sure that there's the other side is also a out there and and spoken for and I'm now that's our side so you know good for Brian and\nHe's apparently he was telling me a text message a few minutes ago that what yeah what the owner went through a with all this was absolutely abhorrent so looking forward to hearing what he has to say about that are coming up tomorrow Nashville's morning news so I I didn't even know the sex the supposed to be honest with you were still around or even still alive\nBut apparently now Johnny Rotten has been seen sporting a make America great again T shirt I Wonder if he himself is getting blasted on social media did you know now that you know the Johnny Rotten was still alive I had absolutely no idea\nYes and I'm Steve Jones the tourists from the Sex Pistols is actually now radio DJ in LA it's he ... yes these ... that\nI Do exactly who that is oh my lord that guy is um\nHe's had a few\nYes yeah yeah he is a radio DJ in Los Angeles and if you I just saw an interview with him and I'm Steve Perry from from journey of course I mean the guy literally I kid you not folksy belts into the microphone and Steve Perry he's looking at a Josie and\nPerry just says what sounded like a good one kind of push it out a little bit of what else to say I I thought it was very funny actually so Steve\nKnows he's dealing with an excess sex pistol he's not probably not shocked by it\nThat's exactly right so apparently he was a this Johnny Rotten was snapped as he leaned out of a window in New Orleans where his band public image LT was due to play is limited I knew with\nThe punk legend appeared to have his are left as hell raising gays in the past to see as he uh was wearing this particular shirt I Wonder it'll be interesting it'd be worth onstage that I think would be fascinating about maybe you can Google that the if a Johnny Rotten actually did\nA where a make America great again shirt on on stage as he was in the\nIn front of all those folks if he did I wouldn't bet money as was to be contrarian\nYeah you know and I it's funny because I thought about that too that what is the what is he really trying to say old Johnny Rotten anyway very good so\nIt's a one Thirteen on super talk I didn't accept WGN I'd very quickly are there are times I don't know where the day is going to that man you don't happen to be this one is very quickly again I was in ... as I said I was in uh East Tennessee over the weekend and so they are on the east coast time right so there are there it's a one hour ahead of us here\nI don't know what the H happened with my phone and apparently this has happened to a lot of people my phone never went back to central time so I got home I went to bed last night and I set my alarm as I usually do for what for thirty in the morning\nMy alarm goes off I think it's four thirty in the morning\nMy phone had never gone back\nTo central time so I'm an hour into my day I've had two cups of coffee and I realize oh wait it's it's like three fifty in the morning I woke up an hour early 'cause my phone getting automatically change back to central time\nSo you would think that'd be far more prepared than apparently I Am today which cause I'm now I'm rambling about you know tied it don't change more time to get beyond\nThat that's you know it's funny that's what one thing that I have noticed is the more time I had the last time I have anyway very quickly so Leslie stall had\nThis uh ethic interview I Would say ethic with President Trump now if you read the headlines out there you'll see that one of the things that they're trying to say is that the president quote unquote as snapped\nAt ... at least all and that is a one of the things that you will see at ... am today this was I Would say a very good interview\nSo I'm going to play some audio from the interview because I think that some of the some of the questions I thought were very telling of Lesley Stahl because let's face it the Trump is out there since the whole Kavanaugh saying are played out Trump has been all over the place and I think the president sees an opportunity and I think Republicans see an opportunity\nBecause we all know that judge Kavanaugh was treated ... by the media by the Democrats you name it this is a guy who absolutely was\nA victim and so I think the president smartly is going about doing a lot of interviews because\nIn this particular case we\nAre just and right in our convictions they judge Kavanaugh is a victim somebody go through some of these questions very quickly and then a play some audio for you and have some commentary as well I one of the things that the president was asked was ... about North Korea and Kim Jong Eun\nI Believe he likes me I like can we have a good relationship too important\nAnd then we fell in love we're really\nMe beautiful letters letter [noise] we fell in love\nI Want to read you his resume okay presides over a cruel kingdom of repression\nGrew lives starvation reports that he had his half brother assassinated slave labor public executions this is a guy on Leno these things I mean I'm not a baby and I won't let why do you love that guy\nLuck luck\nI I like I get along with them okay and I want him okay that said it's like you know it's like an embracing oh what a fan of Brits let it be whatever it is the is that John guy\nLook let it be whatever it is I get along with them really well I have a good interview with him I have a good chemistry with him look at the horrible threats or a man no more threats no more threats\nYeah so that is President Trump talking about Kim Jong un and what are the interesting things about that\nIs the president is absolutely right so she\nReads the or you know his resume and she sort of making fun or mocking of the fact that President Trump said that he and Kim Jong un love each other and I will be honest that is a little a little odd\nBut here's the thing the president is doing what he needs to do to keep Kim jung moon this mad man under control and see I think that's what people are missing that's what Leslie stall I'm sure she's a very smart person\nBut that's what she's missing so she was sitting\nDown for example with a former President Obama which she press President Obama on the fact that all of these things that that she mentioned as far as Kim jung was resume which he asked President Obama why he allowed\nKim Jong moon to continue\nOn with these kinds of policies of slave labor and you know repressive government and obviously no freedom of speech there in um they're North Korea\nA slave labor all the things that that President Obama allowed to continue\nPresident Trump is money that you lay eating Kim Jong moon that's what he's trying to do and so what Leslie stall and the rest of you know I'm nuts as in the mainstream media simply do not understand is that the president is willing to take a hit\nThe president is willing to take a hit in the sense that the media will absolutely blast him when he if you want to utilize the term cozy up whatever\nTalk to Kim Jong moon and negotiate with Kim jung moon and say nice things about Kim Jong soon so he will stop doing all of the things\nThat she just said we're on this guy's resume and he's getting busted for it when the truth of the matter is is that the president is doing what he needs to do to save\nMillions of lives whether we're talking about the the oppressed people of North Korea or people in the rest of the world because this guy well on his way to having nuclear weapons\n\nSo just in in the way that she asked the question and the way that she at least in my opinion it's very easy to state his resume without looking at the bigger picture of what the president is trying to do\nWe've had how many presidents dealing with the the you know past generations of Kim Jong Eun and his family this is the first time that we've been able to get to where we are with North Korea and it does continue\nTo not look at the situation with North Korea and and say that it has not been a success I think it is a missing what I Would say the bigger picture as far as what we've been able to get from North Korea and you know the successes of North Korea I mean I I don't need to go over here you know go over the same material day in and day out\nWell no the successes but you've got to realize that the president he is willing to take the hit now I I Will say and I don't have time to play the audio now but I Will say that the president did make one mistake\nThen what else is there to talk about than if you're going to take this suspension and take it from twenty seven games to Eighteen well then what you really need to do in my opinion where you really need to do\nIs just cancelled the suspension altogether because ah it's clear she has taken responsibility for it and\nYou know both she and Austin probably apparently according to her they could have handled the situation better but the bottom line is she is the one that is accepting responsibility so they should remove his suspension and I would also say kudos to her\nFor coming out and and you know fasting up and saying Austin would never do anything like this and this has to be painful for an awesome watching as well because it's his character and his reputation\nThat has that taken a hit because of these accusations so we'll keep you updated on that story one thirty two on WGN a you know one of the things that when you're overweight and folks I was overweight for a long time\nAnd so one of the things that happens is

I kind of get where he went with that I got some people on the left and go look he doesn't want to talk about it you\nKnow it just hit the conversation that is well Ben had I mean I'd I'd be honest with you I'm a little bored even talking about it now by the wayside speaking of which [noise]\nSo I thought the president's speech last night that speech the interview last time I was very good listen to this I think this is an interesting quote unquote men as the real victims after cabin on hash tag him to gains attention\nNow we talked about this a little bit during the the midst of the whole you know ... before testimony and and cabin all coming out and having his uh his um chance to defend himself\nAnd we had all these are victims that were a calling up to the sexual assault and harassment hotlines whatever was I mean the the usage of those hotline spite can we we all know this\nBut we also found out and I and I had firsthand knowledge of that because a guy called me up when I was doing a radio show and I talked about this in Dallas and said that he himself\n\nWas really dealing with with some some tough memories because she was just like judge Kavanaugh was falsely accused of some very bad things by an ex wife\nAnd so he said that he was really suffered kind of flashbacks and that whole thing because the more than a Christine Blasey Ford spoke the more it was clear that she had absolutely no evidence\nAnd so the whole hash tag him to it now seems to be gaining some attention and so I think this is really interesting\nBecause of a mom has now posted on social media and the name of the mother is um doesn't say her name but but the guy's name her son is named Peter Hanson\nAnd she posted a message on social media comparing the plight of judge Kavanaugh good vigorously denied allegations of sexual aggression to the dating challenges facing her thirty two year old son\nSo think about this because I I've spoken to guide them listen guys talk I'm I'm Single you know and I have a lot of friends that are single I've talked about my you know my group of five friends who you know Sally Raul bunch of divorce losers but whatever\nAnd we've talked about this and how President Trump has said yeah you don't want you guys are being\nFalsely accused\nOf doing horrific things\nUnder the hash tag him a to this woman says it her son is now we're fusing to go on so load dates due to the current climate a false sexual accusations by\nQuote unquote radical feminist with an axe to grind\nNow how do you think that went on social media not necessarily great because people start attacking this woman uh people started attacking her son I mean it it goes on and on but I think that as a a very legitimate thing to be worried about if you're a guy\n\nIs that it's somewhat dangerous for for men these days to go out on these solo dates now I Know that there's a lot of people that will say well you know what about the the creepy guys out there that do these kinds of things listen\nThere's no doubt that there are creepy guys out there there's no doubt also that there are women who were falsely accused men\nAre doing some of these ah horrific things\nAnd the problem is that some of these some of these accusations are are so incredibly old\nAnd without merit that if you're a guy you sit well how would the worldwide defend myself but we've got over this ad nauseam it said to Eighteen on super talk Ninety nine seven WGN Dan magic show what if they would have Heather says has to say real quick on WGN go ahead go ahead\nYeah it was just gonna say you know Trump could have mentioned that that that was certainly calling climate now a liar and they're making on a warm on Saturday Night live so you know ... ... what's the difference if we can go higher but not only remember right [laughter]\nYeah well ... unfortunately Heather and I appreciate the call sadly that's the way it is today\nDid you see this over the weekend here's the headline and I think it plays right into what we what we've been talking to all along Hillary Clinton amongst the left is now known as the kiss of death\n\nShe is somebody who nobody wants on the campaign trail with them Hillary Clinton they say was once the face of the Democratic party a celebrity name who could draw thousands to rallies\nAnd was the all but certain first female president of the United states now she is viewed as the kiss of death for candidates or\nToxic\nThey're absolutely right and what what what what is the latest Hillary outraged by the way it it's um yeah ... that the affair the bill had with Monica Lewinsky\nWas not an abuse of power because ah Lewinsky even though she's twenty two years old at the time she was a she was an adult so in that is by the way I think I've I've I remember correctly I think Palin I actually had a disagreement about this long time ago I Can't remember now so long ago but\nEvery time Hillary speaks you just want her well if you're somebody on the left you want her to stop talking for somebody on the right you want her to keep talking right\nI mean that's for me it seems like the Democrats are finally been able to figure out that Hillary a is indeed toxic as the mid term election campaign enters the home stretch\nThey're saying that Hillary's um Hillary's phone is not ringing at all and so she still has some power as a fundraiser\nBut really when it comes to Cory Booker when it comes to Kamala Harris and some of these other folks Hillary is almost like old school Democrat right and they won absolutely

admit that ... the Washington Post columnist who went missing earlier this month was killed in an interrogation gone wrong\nYou know what I bet\nI've got this whole theory 'cause this is just coming down are coming down now I that that Washington and then President Trump and the Saudis had to have a little come to Jesus because you know that oh you know this is like this is like when you're a parent\nAnd you know that your kid did something wrong and say you given to the count of three for them to admit\nTo their transgression otherwise it's going to get really bad so you give them you're given that moment and you say I did you steal the cookie out of the cookie jar one two and then you\nOkay fine I did it that's exactly what they do their their their eyes are really wide and you know that they're caught and they're trying to figure out what to do and that's I think what the president probably did it the Saudis and no I'm not talking about you know murdering stealing cookies I'm not comparing the two I'm just saying\nThat I think that is what the president said it is done with the Saudis\nIt's almost like you know just admit that you get it\nIf you admitted then we're going to have to figure out a way to deal with this and we'll all just kind of try to try to spin this and move forward I think if\nThe Saudis do come out and they do is admit to killing this guy jumped show gay then um you know it's one of those things where then they figure out a path forward\nReally interesting though and I think also the Saudis realized that they were caught I Would say that the um I Would say that the president and the Turks they had to have something on this guy\nA related to who killed him and uh also how they did it because I was telling me about this and they are first hour you know there there was all these\nAll these theories that the Turks had um video and audio of this guy being tortured and killed in this case you I I feel terrible acts I've done this horrific but I wanted to give it up to at first but the um you know how this affects you\nIs this journalist was apparently I killed by a Saudi Arabia the reason why this matters as many fold but the biggest is the fact that\nGasoline prices could sky rocket if ultimately the president and retaliate against the Saudis because this is the guy ... who was living in Virginia and he was working for the Washington Post as a columnist\nAnd so he ends up at the the ... the Saudi Arabian constantly in Turkey\nHe walks in and he never walks out age than what a couple of weeks now apparently and so his fiance is waiting outside and this is somebody who had been very critical of the Saudi Government\nAs so critical that he decided skirt I Can't do this anymore I Am going to move to the United states and that's exactly what he did and he ended up working for the Washington Post and so he goes back to turkey and then ended a Saudi Arabian constantly and again he'd never comes out\nAnd so there were early reports that he had recorded the entire thing\nHis torture and his murder was captured on his I watch and sent to the cloud and it was in the hands of investigators now\nExperts I've been reading about this I thought it was fascinating\nExperts say that probably didn't happen like that because as simply put the technology isn't there though the why fires and there are there say that are more likely is that the Turks had bugged the entire Saudi Arabian complex because remember this is the Saudi constantly in Turkey\nSo somehow though they've got proof\nAnd so somebody got to the Saudi Arabians and and said you've got to admit this now the breaking news ah from CNN continues I'm just reading this now per CNN the Saudis are preparing a report that they intended to a duck\nAnd bring to show the back to Saudi Arabia but that he was\nInadvertently killed in the process it was all just an accident\n\nYou know it had ended up in one part of the room his leg ended up in another part of the room there was all just\nA I don't I'm not listen I'm not joking about the death of this guy shouldn't matter if it was the Saudi Arabia I mean they've been killing a journalist and people that disagree with the government for a long time\n\nNow spends apparently used to live in a Saudi Arabia stands say you're now in in Cookeville which do you like better Saudi Arabia or cook\nThough [laughter] no comparison or when I when I got off the plane after my you're a and Saudi and I saw the uh a song for barbecued ribs yeah hot I jumped at it uh but uh you know I think you just\nThe the the report you just read is exactly what I was going to say some there are going to come out and say well some body and they were gonna hang up there somebody there overdoes Asian or in their government is going to take the bullet\nYeah literally yep and they're going to blame it on the person it was a it it ... it was a it just ... this guy that worked to get out of control but actually called was I thought it was all around it used to come to Jesus point with the Saudi Arabians oh my gosh yeah\nBack to back it happened we got I mean don't drop is really done a lot", "show_name":
