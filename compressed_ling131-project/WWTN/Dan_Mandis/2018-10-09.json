shuffling of the deck if you will and I'm\nThinking the same thing but what say you\nWell first off thanks again for the opportunity with your work great I have yet to that with almost what's yours truly should yeah record that was an enjoyable evening or ...\nOr look at Donald Trump is is are smart look at the last election first off he's managing this question not unusual for cabinet members to come in saying I'll give you X number of years and particularly in regards to the UN ambassador that's something you do for the duration or you don't\nAnd you take a look at a drinker Patrick you take a look at college right just a platform of national identity and stick with it or you got to get out the elites a former legislator governor she's got a future world which are the presidency not the courts\nAnd it's not going back to be governor so she's got to make crumble ensure faithfully and now they're really smart job managing about kids\nShe's a huge designated hitter right now for them because if the Democrats strategy continues to go forward as be getting men against women and like him\nSteps aside to another position and Nikki Haley becomes a vice presidential nominee Donald Trump is up to his game dramatically and twenty twenty\nWell in and gave it to you I'm going to be full I'm a full disclosure here I didn't hear all of you in Michael said if you had mentioned that earlier but that\nI didn't hear you say that but a earlier today but I was just using on that right before you came on is could this be a situation where because of the whole hash tag me to bludgeon networks affecting heading into the twenty twenty election\nThen that really at least in my estimation that does that pledge in quite a bit\nWhat we're watching what the other side's doing and they will make a decision in the next ... days are Democrats have a decision to make and they all have Ninety Days to bake it are they going to fight in a free for all circus primary as far as who will be the challenger to Donald Trump or are they going to unite\nThe LA up Ninety Days to make that decision they sent their number one player Kamala Harris into the swing state of Ohio last week immediately following the Kevin are here and she addressed a group of two hundred and fifty activist and then walk the streets out there with them in regards to canvassing voters for this upcoming election\nAnd then spoke to a thousand Democrat leaders and money\nPeople that evening in Columbus ohio were rocket rama launched his presidential campaigns\nSo what we've got as a situation where the Eighteen is rolling out I was speaking on the ground and all of this isn't quite Ninety Days insiders will know if it's going to be a fight or there was a unified nominee and if it is Kamala Harris\nThan the whole game plan is going to be picked women against men and activate the Obama coalition recent that Hillary Clinton lost his she had the women against spent part but she couldn't activate the Obama coalition Kamala Harris does Donald Trump starts in a difficult position and they may have Nikki Haley waiting in the wings so\nLet's talk about her tenure as the U.S ambassador to the United nations I mean first of all I Would be willing to bet that most people couldn't could name a lot of these folks I mean you just rattled off a couple I can rattle off a couple as well but which she did\nShe really up to the the identity of that position I mean if you look at the are the folks within the Trump Administration I Would say that her role and given what's a ... a good part of what he's been trying to do is than you are affiliated with the United nations\nBut her role has been\nA very I Would say very much out front\nShe did a great job down and therefore she's leaving at the top of the game not at the bottom which means that memory or so and I think very strategic\nYeah and I don't think they she at this point from her tenure as governor in South Carolina I mean she she had some ... my estimation I think the only thing that I really disagreed with Ron was the whole Confederate statue thing\nBut I mean other than that she is somebody who's been a very good soldier for the Republican Party and so I guess my question would be we know that she has been a somewhat critical of President Trump in the past\nBut I if I remember I did there are no comments that were really come back to hurt her if she was the a running mate of of a President Trump and his uh looking to be the uh for a second term\nWell you're exactly right and that's the difficult challenge she'll have to say she was how much is she willing to let her life be trashed by the same people to trash cabinet and she does have skeletons in her closet that are semi public skeletons that will be brought back out again\nRehash for everyone to view and in light of other people's skeleton these look like little teeny things compared to some of the other stuff but she's got to be willing to go through that because of course that will be what happens and and if she's willing to do that and survived\nUm I think that she could be very valuable to the Trump campaign\nSo Mike Pence you talked about reading the writing on the wrong on the wall for my pants and of course we all need to see as you said what the other side is doing with the Democrats are doing but for Mike Pence the second I started kind of putting all the pieces together\nI saw Mike Pence is sort of like a dead men walking but that's probably not the right way to say it I mean this is the guy who has been a very good uh a good guy for the Trump Administration he's always there for a President Trump or right hand man kind of a person so\nWhat is Mike Pence thinking right now I mean he he was he's done a congressmen and he's been a senator and governor right so where did where does he go from here\nIt's a difficult challenge because my ... parents is clearly qualified\nBoth on experience inside and outside is an industry to be a candidate for president the United states there's no question about it and if you were called duty God Forbid the position that he's in right now oh it was something happening president\nAh and I would say that about any president by the way we don't ever want to lose president ah no matter how bad they may or may not be a policy\nA Michael's called I think he would do a fine job might cut served as rich to evangelical tribute to secure that community for the first election you know now that they're on board\nUm his purposes or you you got to make tough decisions could he actually run at four years from the end of the second term or could you could hear from the beginning of the first time could actually be a candidate twenty twenty four ah for the person at the end when it was a tough decision because in a lot of ways\nKind for Mike Pence has passed in the sense that the kind of candidate that here's that Gerald Ford stalwart decent human being put out a single negative thing in his background just that guy you want this crisis is a celebrity\nThat Americans want to vote for it's a it's a difficult part is yes could it be president of the question is could he be elected\nPresident sets a challenge it is now and I said it was just talking about the\nThe Democrats for a moment we know that did Cory Booker has been out there I think I saw that he was in Iowa last weekend\nA you were talking about Kamala Harris we know that Elizabeth Warren is out there as well and there's a number of these folks and Joe Biden is still is um is President Trump is his called him one percent Joe and so the president is really arming himself with all of his little branding messages and everything else and how bad right now\nIt is an October night to twenty Eighteen so the Kavanaugh saying is sort of in the rearview mirror or we know that there's a lot of Democrats right now who are still talking about impeachment they're still talking about a investigating a bread Kavanaugh's well impeaching the president it goes on and on\nSo you tell me right now ah how bad did the Democrats look to say for example independence or moderates\nWhat a great question I think they look pretty darn that right now in the light of capital they look pretty doggone bad and you know the obstruction side insights the base but it doesn't get\nNormal working paying praying people too in church and you go over the top screaming and gnashing wailing feet\nAre gnashing of teeth and wailing and cutting yourself on the on the up the doors of the Supreme Court that sort of stuff doesn't play really good with people that got to get up in the morning and go to work right I'm it it doesn't work very well so no they don't look good they did not there well but you see they planted a seat there to the men against women for twenty twenty and they felt it was worth it then\nI Want to tell you these people don't act and reactionary fashion ... ... she chick and that's what makes me think that there are real play is going to be a unified ticket behind ... Harris they're already in motion to make that happen\nAll right so how strong they are very quickly David how how strong of a candidate is Kamala Harris\nFirst strong she actually brings both pieces of the equation that Mrs Clinton ... four she brings up the Obama coalition and first female president a narrative into the game she's ... she's strong and she she's saying and I do too I think she is their number one candidate\nI gave it to not eat goes in public square very quickly David what is the upcoming this weekend but I did I hear you've said that the the Christmas special is going to be Nineteen eighty one\nNineteen eighty one Dan Mattis and they song from Germany will feature\nA ...

another way of saying smoking e cigarettes and who that is the type of tobacco pipe that draws smoke to water in a bowl\nAnd here's the thing you cigarettes maybe a lesser evil than traditional cigarettes but who's to expose you to nearly two times as much nicotine as a regular cigarettes according to the researchers people often think of the impact of cigarettes and living on the lungs but nicotine changes the brain\nAs well and we know the human brain isn't then developing until someone in their mid twenties and teens shouldn't be using marijuana either with the exception of medical

[laughter]\nYeah and there was nothing but niceties might pop pay or has now come out and also had blowing things to say about Nikki Haley and she is really at least for me from one of the folks within the Trump Administration\nShe has really come out as someone who has been very supportive of Trump but does remain credible because again she's been willing to criticize\nIf the president when she feels\nLike it is warranted and with this particular administration\nThe ambassador to the United nations here from America as somebody who is really the profile of this position has been up to a great deal thanks to Nikki Haley and I don't know if it's because\nLet's face it she's easy on the eyes she's really smart she looks very good on camera and she's wicked smart I mean there's so many things to like\nAbout Nikki Haley and I think that if the president decides that this is what he wants to do that he wants to ask Mike Pence to step aside and give him a new role for the or his second administration his second term\nAs he tries to get a second term whoever the Democrats are going to run up against him I think as she is someone who would be very good for the president to have\nA by his side here's more of that press conference\nAnd it gets very important for government I understand when it\nDown\nEvery thing down here and I do they\nOther people for that same energy in our into it so it really is a lot of what kind of want to say there's a lot of reasons for leaving the truth is I Want to make sure\nWas a blessing to go into the land\nEvery day and the marathon and I always say that I Will never truly\nHiding from I Will tell you that [laughter]\nYeah and so she's going to I'm assuming she's going to rest up because don't forget the the battle for the presidency is leading up to twenty twenty but that really starts in\nYou know four or five weeks after the midterm elections we are already know that Kamala Harris is out there and and uh Cory Booker is as well we've got Elizabeth Warren we got a Joe Biden as well so there is\nA no no shortage of people running on the left one of the first things I thought of when I saw that as she was stepping down as the ambassador to the United nations is she herself decided to run for twenty twenty and she specifically said no absolutely not\nI'm going to be a campaigning for\nDonald Trump\n[laughter] very important for government official I understand [laughter]\nDown everything down there and I did they [laughter]\nOther people who can for that same energy in our interest so it really is a lot of people are gonna want to say there's a lot of reasons for leaving the truth is I Want\nWas a blessing to go in Cleveland fight\nEver asked so a lot of things that to Nikki Haley has been saying make a lot of sense and I do believe her and I think from a from a political standpoint from a strategic standpoint had again to the um election the presidential election twenty twenty\nMakes all the sense in the world what President Trump I think has up his sleeve and so the big question now is what role\nAnd I I understand that this is all you know sort of just guessing as to what's going to happen here but I think from a political standpoint man does it make all the sense in the world you know how much does Donald Trump by the way he has lost since he announced his White House run you got so many people\nThat they keep talking about President Trump and and how he is at doing things and the decisions that he's making and and all of the tax reforms in and cutting the corporate taxes and all these other things\nThat this is all to benefit President Trump's pocket book I I Know that we've all tired of hearing that narrative from the left Donald Trump\nHas lost one point four billion dollars since he announced his White House run and quite frankly probably even more since I pulled the story last week this is one of those stories are kind of got buried went all the news was going on but guarding a Brett Kavanaugh\nBut yeah you got this whole big a Forbes List where they start talking about the richest Americans President Trump plummeted down the list of the quote unquote ultra rich by a hundred and thirty eight places as Forbes says that he has indeed last one point four billion dollars since twenty Fifteen when he announced his White House run\nNow\nThere's a couple of things that lead to this at one point four billion dollars being lost one is the fact that he according to his tax returns any way and not nearly as rich as some folks thought so there is that part of it so there's more of a clarification as to how much money he had but the other thing is that\nLet's face it the Trump brand we all know the death\nTaken a hit not to mention\nUh his his daughter had a brand of clothing as well and she's just continue to ... if I'm not mistaken\nA millennia has had to know is it helped me out is a ... vodka evocative which one is the wife Lonnie is the wife and his wife thank you Yvonne ... evocative watcher clothing line I don't know why get those two confused as long as lost her clothing line so low smoking hot\n[noise] um\nThat's why you could use the yes spell they are there is no other way around it thank you for throwing that awkward comment out there yet they're both incredibly attractive\nOr Donald Trump's network they dropped at one point four billion dropping that\nDropping dead one hundred and thirty eight places on the Forbes List and yeah they they do talk about\nUh his ties you remember his clothing line also his hotels have taken a hit as well so clearly at least for a President Trump he is not making a whole bunch of money off being president of the United states trust me on that\nAnd that was part of what when Haley came out and she Nikki Haley came out and she said yeah you know I'm not going to I'm going to step down as ambassador to the United nations one of the first things I thought I was I Wonder\nAnd there was other people in the building is while they were thinking about this there are other people who are also thinking the same thing which is I Wonder if Trump's just had enough\nI Wonder if the president and his like you know what just screw this I'm tired of this I'm tired of constantly being under attack I'm tired of being called a racist I'm tired of being called up you know sexual a harasser and massaging is and you know all these other things\nThat was one of my first thought was that he's had enough\nI guess my question is does the president have anything left to prove I'm In our economy is doing really well and you know some of the things that he's really wanted to do\nFar as his campaign promises he wanted to do some of these things but Congress has absolutely stood in his way but the things that he has been able to control he's actually done very well at so one of the questions is All right so what about illegal immigration what about build the wall build the wall or the wall\nOr the president's wanted to build the wall the Congress is I just said it's been a standing in his way so he can blame Congress for that one but the economy's doing well as ... as some of the other things that he has done regarding NAFTA of course we know that he pulled out of NAFTA he now has\nA new deal with Mexico and Canada that also is a very big news for the president as well\nI guess Kanye is going to have a a White House lunch with President Trump\nI think that's going to be on Thursday\nI think that this whole Taylor Swift thing that will talk about coming up I think that part of what Taylor decided to do\nIn coming out in support of Phil Bredesen that may have something to do with ... wearing that make America great again hat as well so we'll talk about that story and a
