ones that have been far more divisive than folks on the right so we will continue again or to find out for you who has also been receiving as some of these says explosive packages over the last couple of hours will have to um\nI find out I I think what's basically going to happen throughout the day to day is that names are going to continue to come out let's see of James Comey ends up getting one and some of the actual anchors on MSNBC and CNN we really just don't know but again right now the names are\nI John Brennan and a block Obama Hillary Eric Holder\nAnd Debbie Wasserman Schultz and again George Soros\nUh yesterday should be a very interesting news day today so we'll talk about that and of course nationalism\nIs in the news that you don't get to this week is free speech week I had no idea that this is free spins around here in America yeah and so what's interesting and Pamela you weren't at your desk when I was trying to get some clarification on these explosives they will say I was in the middle of moving from one studio to the other while this whole thing was going on\nDo we know why exactly it is it the bombs are for example did not go off or they were they ... or was there some sort of a reason why they didn't go off\nThey have that idea I I don't have an answer for that question okay and they are saying that they're very concerned\nThat whoever is sending these they're they're intended destination for instance Hillary or\nBarack Obama whatever they're not the ones that are going to get injured it's going to write carrier right at will end up getting injured so I I don't know I don't know if they were supposed to be time to bonds I don't know if they were waited bombs yeah and there's probably don't have that information\nAt this point and there's reasons why they why they don't necessarily give us all the information and that's because\nThey don't want to encourage any yeah copycats they said that the preliminary belief is that all three devices are of similar pipe bomb style construction so yeah there is that this is just one of those is going to be one of those days Pamela where there's going to be a a lot of news continuing to break throughout\nThe day some of those packages also apparently had some white powder as well suspicious white powder\nOkay and I had very good so we'll look forward to hearing that's according to the NYPD died I so we'll keep folks up to speed on that and feel free to just a break in at any time 'cause this is obviously as a Hillary pointed out to a very divisive a news time very divisive\nA new cycle going on right now and a lot of people coming after President Trump\nAs we know he has now decided to embrace white supremacy once again actually no that's not what he's doing at all actually he's talking about embracing nationalism so here on free speech week one of the things that I I find interesting\nIs that you've got the media and they're talking about free speech we can and and they're a king it liking it if you will including in all of this free speech week\nA free speech regarding the media and freedom of the press and so one of the things that you have to realize is that when the president starts talking about a free speech and when the president himself starts talking about\nEmbracing nationalism well that is what President Trump is embracing nationalism not white nationalism and so one of the things that you have to realize is that\nUh during free speech week you've you've got the media and what they're trying to do is they're actually trying to define\nSpeech and they're trying to define words and I think the problem is that right now what they're trying to do is they're trying to paint President Trump into this white nationalistic corner\nWhen that's absolutely not at all what he's saying and so time dot com has come out and they've got this headline nationalism has gotten a bad reputation\nBut they say it's what America needs right now so I'm going to play you\nA couple of soundbites of a President Trump talking about nationalism and this all came down here in the last twenty forty forty eight hours we talked a little bit about this all yesterday during the program and we'll continue on that realm today by the way we also have a lot of\nA lot of news regarding the caravan the invasion to hoard whatever you want to call the thousands and thousands of migrants that are heading towards our southern border and then once they get into our country if they do than they are indeed illegal aliens and so I have a lot of information on that as well for you today\nAs we continue one but this is President Trump\nAnd he was asked that their within the he had a bunch of reporters in front of him and this particular reporter is asking about his use of the term nationalism and his embracing of nationalism and I want you to listen very closely as to how the reporter poses the question to the president\nOr known as a person who were drawn whistle sooner rather really what I\nNever heard that I cannot imagine that you mean I'm a nurse or so I never heard that theory about big on national is I've heard them all but I'm somebody that loves our country yeah what I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany is paying one percent of GDP for NATO\nAnd we're paying for like three percent at all like that that's a fair\nBut I don't like it was as an example we're protecting\nA Europe [noise]\nAnd we're paying for almost the entire cost of data would write for a very very substantial portion far greater than what I should say all I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years but other countries that are allies of us ...\nThey had not treated our country fairly so that says I Am absolutely a national is that I'm proud of it\nYeah not white nationalist nationalist now if you and I have to go ... what the media on everybody but listen if you if you look at what the media\nThey take great pains in many paragraphs to talk about what nationalism is and what nationalism is not here's what national and eat nationalism is according to ...\nA political social and economic system characterized by the promotion of the interests of a particular nation\nEspecially with the aim of gaining in maintaining sovereignty\nDoesn't sound like a whole bunch of white supremacist say in the ... definition anyway and this is the this is right up at the time they talked about the political ideology of nationalism holes that any nation should govern itself free from outside interference and is linked to the concept of self determination\nI mean you could play into that to it when you talk about this this caravan coming north towards our border\nListen there's nothing I Would say that is a more closely to find with outside interference that a whole bunch of illegal aliens just flooding into our country we could also talking about the Russians but it's also talking about China but good I talked about a number of different things\nBut nowhere in this doesn't say anything about uh about white supremacy now I Do understand that the the concept of nationalism from some people there is some quote unquote baggage that is that that is affiliated with the term nationalism but but listen\nJust because the media is is connecting the word nationalism with white nationalism doesn't necessarily mean that that is something that we should all pay attention to\nJust because the media says that as well as just because the media reports it doesn't make it so\nAnyway what ... again goes on nationalism is further oriented towards developing and maintaining a national identity based on shared social characteristics\nSuch as culture and language and religion and politics I I I don't see anywhere where it says anything about skin color no in fact isn't what makes America great to a whole bunch of different cultures yes\nSo this is one of those things in what computer finding I don't want to read this whole thing has cleared I'm not going to but it's closely linked to patriotism a love of our country that is what nationalism is all about\nSo listen we are in free speech week uh an annual week long celebration of freedom of speech and freedom of press\nIt's not up to the press and it's not up to the media to redefine\nWhat nationalism is all about but that's what they're trying to do so I I Do understand where the president was going with all of this discussion of being a national it's now coming up next I'm going to play for you [noise]\nCNN's hair on fire reaction to the president talking about this embracing of nationalism\nBecause I Would say that when you when you listen to the to the fear\nAnd the upset in their voices it's like it's like the uh the anchor and I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you who the anchors coming up because it's almost like he's got a quiver in his voice\nAnd say we'll talk about that coming up next year on\nA WPN and of course one of the things that they're doing is they are putting forth some of the things that are that are in the news right now in the news today including this this caravan including this invasion uh heading towards America and they talked about how the President's Day\nNow they've got customer after customer that we'll talk about how good these folks are so called them

contributing\nTo the choices people are making to turn to violence there's no question about [noise]\nAnd the way to stop that is to\nTurn back the other way to bring down the temperature\nTo end any messages about the use of violence against people we disagree with\nAnd that has to start at the ...\nThe okay so there it is that that has to start at the top so the Democrats of course are doing what the Democrats like to do they are blaming the president for this and we have absolutely no idea\nWho is behind these packages now apparently going to help to help me out with the list here we've got a suspicious packages that were sent in just to keep people up to speed because they're constantly at tuning in\nWe have suspicious packages it all started yesterday when that package arrived at the home of George Soros and then today as the day is continue to unfold suspicious packages\nHad been sent to John Brennan care of CNN also the home of Hillary Clinton the home of a Brock Obama we've got to Eric Holder\nA Debbie Wasserman Schultz as well so there are a lot of our Maxine Waters one addressed in acting out one address to Maxine Waters\nAs well and let's not forget yeah it was Maxine Waters who was the one that was encouraging people to harass members of the Trump Administration so there's that aspect of this as well now\nAs we aren't podium watch um we're waiting for the president to come out he is immediately by the way\nI just about any acts of violence against um you know Democrats Republicans alike and the president was very quick to come out and condemn\nA de suspicious packages no matter who sent them obviously he's been condemning these suspicious packages and he's doing the right thing which is coming out and he's going to\nSay something whatever it is to the American people and it looks like we're we're getting very close because I'm not sure if you're watching the same thing I Am but they've just brought a whole bunch of folks out to stand\nBehind the president and so we'll find out what the president has to say here just I'm assuming he's going to start\nSpeaking in the next couple of minutes and so we are waiting President Trump and his remarks\nOn these are suspicious packages and again I think one of the biggest news stories\nOf the day is obviously the suspicious packages but also the um the reaction from both the left and the right this is a this is Andrew Cuomo listen to what he has to say he's talking about the toxic rhetoric or in politics today listen\nWhy believe the heated rhetoric that toxic environment is part of this yes we are we going to full investigation or a suggestion of the pattern is that they are for literally a related\nNow I'd so there you go and it's so this is going to be this is going to be the um the narrative of the left this is going to be the talking points for the left\nFor the next several days and I hope no one gets hurt here and I'm sure that if there are people like Maxine Waters and and that John Brennan and I'm Andrew Cuomo and a lot of these other folks that have been receiving these suspicious packages now for somebody who is on the left and your most certainly\nOn high alert and so we'll have to wait and see who else get these packages today we'll see what are the president has to say about these are suspicious packages now one of the things that the Democrats are saying and of course uh we've been talking about this for\nA long time now is the nasty rhetoric that that is happening in America today and often times the Democrats what they're trying to do\nIs they're trying to pin this so called a nasty rhetoric on the president but I'll tell you what\nIf you look at any new show any time\nIf it's on CNN or MSNBC and you read some of the various media outlets including the New York times in the Washington Post the nastiness is so so more so so much higher\nOn the left than it is on the right and so for the president and I do understand he is the president of the United states\nSo when the president came out the other day and he said that Elizabeth Warren she has so little Native American a DNA or heritage in her that she doesn't even deserve the name Pocahontas which is\nYou know the latest on that story which is our week old or so you have a lot of people and left distorted yes I like to use the term a lot because it to me it is apropos for how the media reacts to this president and that is that they started\nHyperventilating they criticized him for that saying that oh look the president is a one more time harassing not only a woman but are well respected member of Congress of the Senate so but that's all fine and well but you have to look at it from the standpoint\nOf public opinion and what the media and what the Democrats are trying to do\nIn shape public opinion and this is what they do\nThey talked about boiling points they talk about rhetoric they talked about how we are we are at a scary time in America and I do appreciate that we are at a scary time in America One of the things that I Would ask is all of these Democrats and all of these folks are in the media\nWhen you had Mitch McConnell this was a couple of days ago now but yeah Mitch McConnell simply trying to eat in a restaurant in Kentucky a couple of days ago just very quietly trying to have some self a little dinner and you had these people bust into the restaurant and their starts screaming about Mitch McConnell they're\nThey're screaming about all the bad things that he's done very few people in the media will will disavow or condemn\nThat kind of behavior\nSo one of the things that you got to realize is for the Democrats and for the media they're all about just allowing these kinds of things to happen and not holding themselves accountable for the things that they are doing to add to this so called toxic environment\n\nAnd so that's going to be one of the questions that I Would ask the media moving forward and that is and we've been asking this all along which is when you show that Ninety what does that media research ... or counseled last time they showed what was it Ninety to Ninety three Ninety five percent\nOf the of the media coverage of President Trump is negative when we know that\nAnd when we know that not only is it negative but it's it's also a very nasty nasty rhetoric at that then one of the things you gotta realize and people who are professional media watchers if you well and I\nHate to say but that's me and and perhaps you as well because you consume media because you listen to W. ten\nSo you understand precisely just like I Do what is contributing to this nasty toxic time here in America when you had Hillary saying the things that she says about\nHow the ... it's impossible to be civil with the Republicans it's impossible to be civil with the President Trump and are the folks in Congress and house of representatives and the Senate\nBecause of the fact that they are Republicans when you have them throwing down the term a deplorable uh this is something that is that is contributing to this toxic environment but nobody will call out the Clintons they simply will not\nNow I'm looking at this um where is this Pamela this press conferences why early someplace in the White House and so now I've seen are watching President Trump Wade through the crowd and uh he's got\nBut there's some sort of ceremony going on right now and I'm not really sure well or had that's why I had all the ... and said they're probably going to make some comments any moment of ... actually at the podium first she is with her husband ladies first [laughter]\nAnd she's going to introduce her husband and then it's a ... expected that he'll make some comments okay nobody speaking at\nYou know I got that I always say you're going to listen to that I'm going to talk to folks about Paul Winkler and once President Trump started speaking uh hopefully he'll open up with comments about the easier it is just here we got this is ...\nThat he can be done under by my family probably ... individual who knows anything we can do they know scholarly attack and I strongly condemn own\nHutus violence

[laughter] I just can't wait on me along [laughter]\n[noise]\nAnd I go ... dance your heart will not go on well anyway it never in a thousand years could I have a magic and that you wouldn't know free bird I never could so that was not a set up that was a genuine you're kidding me right I mean\nYou're saying you played the opening raff now had you started it you know midway through the ... when they go free bird [laughter] yeah that's in you mind if that's what I Would have known that it was ... [laughter]\nBut see what I what I noticed about that is and and people still there is not an event that that goes by where somebody doesn't talk about how I didn't know free [laughter]\nOh thank you for that see I mean and it's also like\nNot knowing ring of fire I mean I and I know they don't even know that one too I Know I knew ring of fire I mean it's just\nYeah and what was the other one there was another one that you played where was I don't know I did ... I think it was kind of wait hold on one it was the titles that yeah that was three okay so it has now been established that you sometimes we'll do the same I sometimes intention all the time to intentionally make me look silly and stupid\nWell I I mean come on and you know who can't wait to what he was because you don't know anything about fights a country music that's exactly right but I again the that the Leonard scattered one right that was genuine I Would have never imagined\nYou are stumped I ... I was I was yes yes I just you know I I don't know I I've listened to this in fact when I went home that day\nI pulled it up on my phone and I and I listen to a free bird and oddly enough you know by the time I finally got home the song was over at that long of a song\nOh yeah it's oh yeah there were stairway to heaven as far as linked\nIt ... I mean it's yeah yeah I don't but some people I just don't think that's the best song by Leonard scattered I don't I think ... give me three steps or or the other one\nWell it's not as a matter of fact a that's subjective comment anyway but I like their signature song current is the same way that\nFree but ... really ... limits your song ... and ... and then so we don't Alabama yeah I Would say it's sweet and like I Would say and not give me three steps correct okay\nFair enough but you know what's going on by the way with some litter scared now that I'm completely off the rails\nSo we all remember the plane crash with Leonard ...\nAnd ... says that you know the some of the band members died I don't even up so anyway [noise] the the agreement with the band was that they would never profit off of the plane crash and so\nYou know the name of the brothers the last name vent that very good just chicken bone I had to think about it for a second that's all right\nBut no this is ... ... it it's Johnny, Johnny ... Ghani yep and uh and so the plane crash happens and the remaining band members of survivors had said that they would never profit off of it never sell their story\nWell now apparently the drummer of Leonard's skin or the drummer there was determined to a time of the plane crash artist ...\nHas decided that he will tell his story so I guess now they're making a movie about the plane crash in about men are scattered right up there with a movie about a Freddy Mercury bohemian Rhapsody which I Can't wait to see that there was a movie about John coming out I don't know if you you too knew that there and did not know that yeah now there's a ...\nA a movie come out as well I bet it's from the the drummers perspective from the drummers perspective if he ever signed a piece of paper saying he'd never know historian apparently you know her was part of the original like well they took him to court and ... and ... wine\nIs he has a right to tell his story ... ... you know not tell his story yeah it's not like he's the third party who was nowhere near his variants yeah\nOkay that was helped me out guys 'cause in I'm In foreign territory or what was he on the plane or did everybody on the plane dire no no no no no okay so that was the drama that we are talking about currently was he on the plane\nNo magic okay I see that I don't know but that regardless of whether whether he was on the
