{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Or the other one is Sheree laws just like Jewish law uh there's one of the first things we covered I don't know how many years ago together no matter what am I going to say here because I don't ... Jewish\nLaw like Christian law applies to a Jew in a Christian or by their own volition worship ... applies to everyone does the title of your books ... for non Muslims the problem is they're law gets pulled on me and their punishment gets put on me I have no freedom\nAnd why they say that as Michael ... Jewish law ... says you can't go back in ... says nobody gets to\nThat [laughter] it's exactly a you're not a cat for Europe person up the book I don't know I don't know that there's much they actually that that's inaccurate but the destination would be the same\nRight this is one of their favorite I always when I'm dealing with Muslims identify myself as a calculated always they don't like that at all because that's their secret dirty word I'm not supposed to do\nSo they say no no no no no you're you're you're not a cap her I yes I Am I don't believe them out it was the profit of a lot I don't believe the crime has truth in it so I'm a ...\nBut first they didn't like it a call yourself that children's book can be Jew or Christian for it for you you got to denounce the Torah Moses David a for a Christian you've got to denounce Jesus you go to denounce the new\nTestament I mean either way the apple you end up in the same spot you accept Mohammed Atta only profit and you accept them as the only religion or your text or killed right either way you're them to St joy I really don't care what they call me when they kill me\n[laughter] I mean I'd just rather not kill him and call me something\nWhile they might call your friend uh and and by the way this this came up earlier in this very same chapter people often say well I have a Muslim friends and he's a great guy which has nothing to do with Mohammed nothing to do with a trilogy of tax and nothing to do with sharia law in Islam\nA plus they're taught to treat you like a friend until such time you're not\n[noise] and by the way they may not be that good of a Muslim that is they may actually think he was a real true friend you see it's kind of wearing an upside down world here\nI kind of rushed through these cars I wanted to um get to this section I shouldn't do this is probably the most significant battleground we're in right now and that is the bridge building an interfaith dialogue\nAh this this is about as ignorant as to coexist bumper sticker because there's only one symbol on a bumper sticker that refuses to coexist\nAnd it's a very one that you're trying to get me to exist with a it's kind of like what we deal with with Palestine and Israel the biggest problem and that is Palestine doesn't the Palestinians they don't ah acknowledge Israel's right to exist they don't want to have a state next to it they don't they want their state\nUm but interfaith this is certainly something that throughout your teaching and throughout your\nThe evolution if you will of of everything that that you're teaching you have come across the most and um\nYou know I don't want that drives me up the wall thrill is Michael because the people show up at these events ought to be well planned to know what they're talking about I make the analogy if you've got to be able to bridge you go and you do survey work on both sides of the river then you know how to build a bridge but these\nChristians and Jews as you over these ... gatherings there were there to be nice and that's all there therefore they wouldn't offend anybody except me\n[noise] uh what do they really building and their attempts to build a bridge\nThere building rainbows\n[laughter] oh they're building domestication which can embolden the aggressor no\nYes and the thing of it is is it this\nHas not changed since nine eleven my wife and I went to an event the first multi faith a gathering and after nine eleven\nThe Baptist minister showed up he didn't occur on pop from candy the rabbi showed up they never read the Koran but the emotion that shut up his dad had courses in both the New Testament and the Old Testament he's the only man that came with his homework done guess who look good on stage\nIs it not also probably relevant and true that the reality is this becomes less and less um about truth and about rights and it becomes about\nEmotion and tolerance um and I guess I Would boil it down this way the biggest mistake I see and all of this is conflate in or confusing validation and tolerance\nDoes that lab right\nExpensive in the in the sense that they are\nThey think that they have to validate Islam\nAnd be friends with them and acceptable to them and you don't\nI can be tolerant and respectful the Bible teaches me to do that the constitution demands I Do that but that doesn't mean that I validate Mohammed it doesn't mean validate the Koran validate the life of Mohammed or validate the hippies or validate sharia law I can tolerate them and still opposed\nThem quite frankly and and should\nBecause of Jesus said that is finished and she just said I and the way the truth in life and nobody comes to the father except through me that's a problem moving forward if the only way I completed a Muslim is tell them oh the mom is good too\n[laughter] I mean I've seen them do\nThat I actually think I really do think and I've said some of these things off the air to you I Want you to explore that thought while we're off for two weeks 'cause I'm telling you you would write a book that's a knockout\nWe are confusing validation and tolerance validation and respect\nAnd I think it's a big part of the problem it manifest itself the greatest during these interfaith movement um that we often hear well there's a lot of moderates on Islamic websites\nOr the other op eds on Muslim websites to\nWell that's the problem the book the crowd was doing this to document it can it has both good and bad in it and so the fact that there's websites devote themselves to just the good is another way of saying there are websites would devote himself to negating neglecting and forbidding and then I Want is bad\nThis one I'm going to add to ah it's radical Islamic groups um you can't get past the word radical what his radical me does it mean killing robbing and sleeping assassinating torturing deception jihad I mean what they do get they get hijacked by their own profit the writer and create you\nKnow they're not that the Islamic state we've been over there a lot but the only thing like al ... Islamic state are not radicals they're simply obeying they're totally devout they and they all of the Koran and the sooner mom it's\nThis is very ... there was about this is very much the Taylor Swift doctor and you don't even have the conversation you don't even have the debate you don't even explore the reasonable position you just call it evil but they they will often to fall to camp but mine is lumps holy profits so few close to zero or the ...\nUm they don't like by the way who declared him holy did you know but the Muslims to\nYeah well [laughter] they they're welcome to calling Holly but that doesn't mean actually call and that\nReally got one minute left the last two are there are fundamentalists in every religion code word for dangerous an interfaith dialogue will let us meet Muslims and change them know what\nI find is every time we mean Muslims they change Raasch change or whether it's in prison whether it's on television whether it's in a boxing ring [noise] your thoughts\nWhile you're exactly correct I mean look as I say need a moslem and need anybody else I'm not picking on people are and if you want to change them have a discussion about mama that's the way to change them because you'll find that they knew I bet you know more about Mohammed than they do\nI say the Bible has many applications but it's an original Hebrew in its original Greek and only has one interpretation they'll default the way people trying to change the Bible and its meaning an application to follow it all depends on how you interpret it you know\nYou can study it in or out of Arabic and you can pretty much get it [laughter]\nIt's actually quite easy to get why don't you think coated I mean is I think what you put the Koran and the right time order it's like oh this makes sense now you start out with a hand to God and then with political domination in the world\nAll these things that we talk about come straight out of factual persuasion changing the minds of Islam supporters it's a lot about Islam and it's a lot about how to have a impactful and effective it's our conversation you can find these great works we have other teachings on the Koran and a lot of

have worked at I Would do well in an individual God of the hands of the other individual I don't know from our perspective\nWhat circumstances were nobody was talking about somebody or what have you ever thought I Would check the more you know almost thought and then watch law enforcement completes there and then it would be determined you know again whether it was a soccer or whether it\nWas right at first degree murder negligent homicide you know that sort of thing All right but real\nWell off and do my terminal just you know what he was guilty of murder but you know so first of all there's just a broad broad\nBroad broad term All right well see that helps me because that just again when you say homicide you're already thinking murder I mean you know that's just the so but thank you for the technical definition I appreciate that\nBut the but to me it just when when that is released like that doesn't that then land to the\n[noise] political\nPublic relations I guess it's\nUnfortunate I you don't have a choice as that gentleman just described being a corner or deputy coroner whenever you fed 'em\nYou don't have a choice but\nJust I hate that it puts into the public's mind that this is ... could be murder you think homicide murder or homicide murder\nWe all know he didn't die at his own hands like I said we all know he didn't die of natural causes we know that he died at the end of the metro police officer whether it was justified or not that's what's going to be determined\n\nBut uh that's just that's my two cents on that particular want it bothered me the moments that I heard it this morning and I just I wanted to express that because it just seems like it's it's falling into the narrative of wanting to\nBrand this metro officer is guilty of murder\nWhen that may not be the case now I Know here WGN we actually watched that video and gave you are honest reaction as we were watching him we described it to you Dan mantis did I Believe ... year that day when I did and and\nIt's the video that we've seen from the bird's eye view it didn't look great for this metro police officer because we couldn't from a bird's eye view see the gun\nThat was allegedly and Daniel hand breaks hand\nWe weren't we ... we we weren't looking clothes at the situation we certainly weren't in the shoes of officer del ... so we don't know what he was seeing\nAnd we don't know what he was thinking all we could see was the bird's eye view it didn't look great for this officer\n\nBut I think unfortunately in this climate there are those that are quick to say this officers guilty of wanting to kill this man of murder before going through every little piece of information\n\nBefore an investigation is even complete and it goes with the narrative of wanting to have this community oversight board for crying out loud\n\nAnd I'm telling you that if that happens I Know this beyond a shadow of a doubt if that oversight board which we as Davidson county citizens get to vote for or against come November is amendments one on our ballot in Davidson county\nIf we vote for ... I Believe metro police officers are kind of leave us in droves and in a city in a community where crimes seems to be on the rise\nWhere it seems as if there's a shooting every day where it seems as if you can't walk down our streets without somebody getting mud or beaten up or as I said a moment ago shot\nAnd metro police officers are going to be leaving in droves\nThat's not good\nWhere the city I Would like to be the safe city [laughter] and I would like to think that we have our men and women and blue backing us and protecting us\nWith everything they've got not being afraid to do so because the community oversight board might see it politically differently than they did in that situation in their own shoes in the heat of the battle\n\nAnd they end up losing their badge losing their pension and potentially their freedom\n\nBy people who know nothing about law enforcement they know nothing about defending anything defending anybody\n\nAnd we're going to put the fate of our police officers and our police department in their hands just seems crazy to me\nIt is twelve seventeenth I'm Pamela for I'm In for Dan Man does seven three seven nine nine eight six is the telephone number I kinda got real any real fast it on a friday sorry about that\n\nBut I have it on my mind just immediately hearing can report that story\nHomicide ...\nWhen you hear I Know you're like me when you hear that you think oh he murdered him\nAnd that's not necessarily the case alright twelve Seventeen I'm Pamela for him for ten minutes this is to protect many nine seven W ten\nMinutes go by one time show the director of the dogs will move we make sure she joins us after three super tall Seventy nine seven\n\nMen just want to remind you about my friends a busy be HVAC the colder weather or thank the lord is finally here now within a few months is going to get a really cold which is why you need to make sure that your heating their unit is ready for\nThe cold winter ahead that is where my friends had busy be HVAC come in\nWhich you need to do use you need to sign up to become a beehive member\nWhat that does is it saves you money and you know that your protected here's what you get when you sign up to become that beehive member\nYou get guaranteed Saturday service you get ten percent off of all repairs you also get one heating and one pulling maintenance visit per year but the bottom line on this is you also get peace of mind you know that your heating and air unit is going to protect you and your family\nFor the coming winter they've got customers after customers little talk about how good these folks really are you know William and brand and the owners\nThey're total focus is on your total protection customer service now if something does go wrong to do is call them six one five seven seven five Seventy eight thirty three\nDon't get it taken care of right away they are a Christian based company that I really like doing business with and you will to so called them today and become a beehive member busy be HVAC six one five seven seven five Seventy thirty three find them online and busy P.

damage along Mexico Beach Florida\nOnly thing I could ... you know I was in Japan in two thousand eleven out to the nominee there when we came across entire towns were there was nothing left this see behind me is about as close to that as you can now there are structures that are left here but just about everything was either flattened or very very heavily damaged\n\nBecause it's your people are saying those things\nIt's gotta be trickling down from the top if his people think you're ignorant you're just a country redneck on educated hillbilly kind of voter\nThat's got to be coming from the top has to be and that that really bugs me\nAnd for that reason alone you'll never hear the words out of my mouth Phil Bredesen is a big guy\n\nIf he's going to lie to you and me as a political move but doesn't make him a good guy that makes him a liar it's not a political move it said ally\n\nAnd I what concerns me and I said this to everybody who works this radio station yesterday\nSet it in the halls I said it in the newsroom I'm going to say it here with the microphone open what concerns me is that that video\nIs only being played to the choir you and I know about it what about other moderates in the state\nYou know is it playing in Chattanooga is it playing in Knoxville is it playing in Memphis\n\nModerates who may not listen to a conservative radio all the time\nI certainly know that I don't think I have an double check this morning but as of\nSix o'clock last night I don't think any of our local television stations were covering the story I think I did see a news alert pop up from Fox Seventeen saying they were going to investigate to see if this was a fake video or if it was a real video\nWhich is their ... that's actually perfectly fine to do I think they're going to discover is real if you're\nWorth your weight in gold you you have to ask those questions especially if you're not familiar with project tossed\nSo if it's not playing\nOn local television if you're a local TV I'm Sorry your local newspapers aren't picking up the story\n\nNot only in Nashville Knoxville to Knoxville paper the Chattanooga paper the Memphis paper when I say paper of course we realize it's mostly on the Internet these days is they're not picking up the story\nThen do the moderates in the state no that Phil Bredesen or his people even set those things\n\nThat's what concerns me now again her Marsha Blackburn poll numbers of course are up that's the good news I Would like to see it landslide in ...\n\nAnd I think if more moderates in the state knew about that video had seen that video had heard the audio from that video it would be more of a landslide\nWhat concerns me from my understanding\n\nThe people in that video who made the statements are still working on the Phil Bredesen campaign\n\nI get rid of them just for being stupid\n\nWhy in the world would you ever say anything like that to a member\nOf the media she went in as a journalist with a hidden camera\nShe told them she was a journalist [noise] she does and she was a member of the media and they were stupid enough to say those things to her\n\nThe one guy will Stewart looks like he's got to be Seventeen [laughter] he looks really young\nAt either get rid of I'm\nSure he's young maybe lesson learned maybe apology like crazy but I'll tell you this is Marsha Blackburn doesn't use that audio and use\nThe video and her campaign spots she's missing a big big opportunity\n\nThat's probably the only way that more moderates in the state are going to hear it\nIf she's by an audio or buying commercials everywhere TV radio whether they're conservative friendly or not doesn't matter\nJust like Phil Bredesen is doing the same thing I mean he's buying radio ads here hoping to get his message to the moderates that listen to our radio station\n\nBothers me to no end that he and his people think of us\nIs an educated and stupid and gullible\n\nThey've got another thing coming\nAnd instead of just opening up their eyes and realizing no they are formidable candidates\nAnd opponents know what they're doing who not only have the heartbeat of America or no the heartbeat of America but\nAre on the side of the right and I mean that literally literally and figuratively\n\nNow I'll tell ya ...

so much\nThis and resources into stopping the importation of intellectual property theft under patterns where people off shore the copy they manufacture the imported it is entirely up to the patent holder\nTo stop it ... if it's manufactured domestically the federal government does nothing to assist with that\nSaid makes no sense does it\nWell the thing is is that the U.S patent and trademark office ... he was a branch of the federal government and they do their research they look at it and they determine okay this is a individual concept the show and it has a term limit on it that it will sunset right\nAnd in there you can go to their page and on their about us that says that they grant you exclusive white that his capitalized just like it is in the um the bill of rights mhm\nAnd if I Want to exercise my exclusive right if somebody is he older copies my ... my ambition my device I have to first hire an attorney\nTo do research it yes it is my patent it is out there I have a legitimate claim to it before they were even send out a cease and desist that's five grand ... to turn around if they don't teach them to\nTo turn around and follow in federal court yet another Fifteen grand just to file\nAnd then it goes up from there based on the opposition's whether or not he goes to litigation if you actually come to the point of an agreement so individual stops but if they stop they can also demand they have the right to demand compensation\nFor what they've already made and sold ... those they don't have to give away all their profit that they stole\nYeah they that they stole and see and what you're describing to me I'm seeing the little guy who had the pat and then the first place put completely out of business because they're not going to be able to

years and this is\nCertainly the first step and helping intellectual property holders thank you very much ... go ahead I'm Sorry to say\nWell this is what I Would like to see is for the um\nThe about having to file in federal court against in furniture would be to collect information showing that it's been for him to turn it back to my state\nDepartment of justice office they look at it was like yeah this is yours or the other guy looks like he's going to go to the OJ office in the ...\nState they look at it they investigated they go over knock on the door and say hey you're so and so yeah you're doing this yeah\nStyle okay yeah and it was you know just give us your information and proves that it's yours yeah and if not then they just\nSit them with a um a cease and desist than if they violate that then they turn around they can give him for a felony or depending on how much has been sold and the state that they're in such different levels for a felony mhm different dollar level\nAnd at that point once that's done then I can turn around in a lower court and filed for restitution\nSounds like you might be a patent holder I think you wouldn't be right [laughter]\nIt sounds like you may have been screwed along the way somewhere [laughter] twice you know oh wow have you gone to any of your legislators and and talk to them about these things\nI have actually been in

'cause it it's not actually something tangible you're holding your and\nWhen you're talking about patents or copyright that yet the staff distilled there and the damage is still there when somebody steals it from you or becomes rich off of it\nAnd and doesn't pay you the right or the royalty that you know deserves\nWhen I was ah when I was in college and I had a a part time job I won't say where but it was here in town there was a the owner of the establishment what plays radio for gas in in the uh in in the ... mhm and you didn't have a ... just basically the way you pay to use write songs of\nThe ... yeah it's a performance right license yeah correct and\nUh there was a few times where I'm reps would come in and try to discuss the issue with him and he would basically throw them out and eventually one of the um one of the company a reader BMI or ask up one suit him and that's what they had to do to get him to pay to use multiple\nUm artists music in his establishment to entertain has guests so why\nDo I do never I never understood why do you think you should be allowed to use that for free well they think because it's on ... when you have yeah we have to pay for it again are going to sublet that from radio to using your restaurant you should have to pay to use the N\nI don't disagree because that's part of your product and that's part of the the um\nOn beyond ... if you will and you're making money off of that as your guests feel a you know there's a difference\nIn a certain atmosphere because of it the whole nine yards so you're making money I don't disagree boy and go off on that all day long I don't disagree with that beat people think because it's free on the radio and you don't have to pay for it there's there is a fair use concept of course\nWhen you purchase something then there is a fair use that you can then play it in your car play it in your house a loan\nIt even Iranian or if I'm having a one hundred person party I'm right ... yeah 'cause you\nPurchased it that's that's where the fair use comes in but what you can't do is then purchase it and then make twenty copies of it and sell and sell them yeah ... eccentric\nOr even or even give them away now than at that point you're imposing upon the creators ability to monetize their correct correct that's why a\nYear ago years ago Garth Brooks if I remember correctly you ... you had all these secondhand stores selling\nA used records used to sat used what have you\nAnd he wanted to shut that down he thought royalty should be paid on that because you were ... reselling it\nIt was purchased one but your salary selling it again for fight you know five bucks and whatever it might that I disagree with but that's what that was his thinking in that year year monetize things still off as my copyright you're you're still making money off of Mike how you doing\nThat's no different than than um you know BMW coming to me after the fact and going wait a minute you're\nYou're selling
