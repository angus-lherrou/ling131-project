Miller of day I'm much more President Trump says the U.S alliance with Saudi Arabia is important but he devised given the royal family cover for the disappearance and suspected murder of those Saudi

justice we may get answers to the big questions hovering over the Russia investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller sometime shortly after the midterm elections correspondence Carrie ...\nThey do talk about how Nashville attended along with the Anti Defamation league back in twenty a lab and they sent a delegation to Israel to learn it on you know the tactics of counterterrorism\nNow there are paralleling it with if you're cops are being trained by Israeli military or police they're coming they're going to racially profile you kill more members of your community\nAnd then you see it again isn't that the problem with amendment one and the way that it's been written\nIs that it does have a presumption the the the opening salvo really used in the narrative is that there seems to be at least there's a concern from people who have who have read this who have experience in law enforcement\nIs that there is a presumption that the Nashville police department is riddled\nWith racism and there's an an a common thread throughout the entire department of racism so on it's on his very basis at least to me it is attacking the police officers and it's attacking Nashville's police force\nAbsolutely it is and you know what every profession every career at every you know job has some form a person in it that hold biases\nA has races and you know throughout their their life in comes out in whatever they're doing those are the officers that leave the job fairly early they don't make their Twenty years or more than Twenty years um and those are the ones that\nIt's the wait it out but there's a system in place to do that they're you know this oversight is beginning to look like overreach and even further beyond that\nYou know when you have these types of groups that are basically calling for the abolition of police\nUm there is no unbiased fair decision or building bridges between the communities and law enforcement and that's why this particular makeup of this particular coalition is extremely extremely dangerous you got the N. double ACP they serve a purpose they tend\nThey tend to be fair there tend to be open minded um you know they are a good fit for this coalition\nOf but I Would say get in the army the the standing up her racial justice and certainly black lives matter\nHas no place a you know to be on a board that is going to be a working with law enforcement on to recommend policy changes and things like that you can't have that form of hate or you know on the type of board it just isn't going to work\nOr caffeine let me ask you have to run against the daily wrote called dot com Kaur spent Twenty years on the police force in the state of New York and so one of the things that I Would have to ask is as we look at the makeup of amendment one and we look up at the at the makeup of this community oversight board\nAre there other community over same boards across the country they would have a similar makeup where you where you have some of these groups are that are getting ends army like an in black lives matter like where they have a presence on these kinds of community oversight board in other parts of the country\nThey're trying especially in the larger cities where there have been you know a line of\nPolice shootings against members of the community they're trying but to my knowledge there hasn't been a lot of success because really it it isn't about you know instant justice or um you know demanding that they get subpoena power things like that\nOurs was called a community review board it was very fair that were members of the community they were active there\nThey were outspoken but they were able to sit down at the table and discuss and talk about you know the importance of working with the community had to be effective in the community listening there never was this this racial hatred and division and bigotry\nRate it until a few years ago you know I mean we've always had racism or but you know when you talk about ... and I personally know the cheap ... he told me on several occasions through his Thirty years on the police department he never had issues\nWith the communities um you know the people of color or what they call marginalized communities it wasn't until late when I'm you know Eric Holder and it's an outside group started coming in saying that the police were racist that this problem occurred\nSo there's always been a thin read through these communities of a problem but overall we have never had this this type of division this is something that is\nA you know being pushed by certain resistance\nAnd those are the problem is and what you and I both know what the problem is the problem is that first of all we still I and I can't believe\nEven I watch the three four years ago after Michael Brown was shot we still have people that are saying that this was just an innocent teenager was gunned down the street and so the problem is that this narrative is still perpetuated\nIn the media and among these groups as well when as a matter of fact we know that Michael Brown was going for the gun of Darren Wilson and Darren\nWilson officer Wilson was simply trying to save his own life and we know because uh we see in the autopsy report and and we've seen all the the um the research and everything was done on this particular\nSituation that was going on in Ferguson, Missouri but you\nHave these activist groups that they have their own agenda and so that is ultimately what it seems to me that was the real beginning of all of this and then we have to happen here with as your quiz Clemens in some other some other issues between the police in the community but in the ... Clemens that seems to be\nThe case here in Nashville that everybody is pointing to\nBut in that particular case it's the same thing we're Clemens was going for a gun and he was carrying a gun\nAnd so the officer had no choice but to do what he had to do which was a shoot the guy because\nHad he not Clemens would've gotten hold of that gun and shot the officer so it's there's always going to be two sides to his story but as far as amendment one goes in and the community oversight board that may or may not be approved by the people of Nashville and Davidson county do you think that\nIf this ultimately goes into effect what will be effect to be on Nashville police force\nI think you'll see not only the morale be extremely low with those numbers already I think you'll see a complete lack of interest in any one uh joining the police department I mean why would you joined the police department if every action or reaction you have\nA is going to be scrutinized unfairly and so you know you're looking at a good sized police department who their recruitment is down from what I understand because nobody wants a job\nUm it's very difficult job you know there are two sides to every story there are reasons why police are acting the way we've got fifty police officers killed already in the line of duty this year they're second guessing themselves when they go on these calls and this is why they're dying\nWe can't have that but who wants to be on the police department when this sort of board is overreaching into your back pocket and looking at everything you do we can't have that we have plenty of\nOrganization entities that are overlooking the police as it is you know we've got the office of professional accountability which is basically\nUm you know it it the oversight within the police department internal affairs if you will we've got the grand jury system we've got state general ... attorneys district attorneys we've got plenty of people overlooking the police department\nCommunity has a right to have a say but they do not have a right to overreach\nAre telling me ask you this I asked you what the effect would be on the police force what do you think is just community oversight board goes into effect\n... what would the effect to be\nOn the community if the community wants it and the community gets it what are they expecting it is going to change I Can't imagine that they think that suddenly their lives are going to get any better one of the things that I've noticed over Thirty years working in news and talk radio\nIs that there there are some folks in in our community and in these communities\nThey think that the police are the core of all of their problems when we know that no the police are not the core of the problems to the police are in a result\nOf all the problems in those communities in the sense that the police\nHave to really focus on these communities to try and keep the law and order so what do you think the effect will be on these communities okay you have your oversight board and you still have a lot of murders you still have fatherless household you still have\nA high crime rate you still have all the things all the problems that have play these communities for generations\nYeah well you're not going to see a proactive a police\nYou know involvement in ... in everyday activity that's happening in the drug written communities um you know where the police presence does deter this you'll see a more of a laid back approach they'll be probably just answering the call that they are given or not you're not going to necessarily see a lot of pro activity on street\nA lotta people like that but I think a lot of the voices of these communities have been hijacked by the activists\nWho have bigger mouths because people do want the police in their community they do on drug dealers in drug uh you know users being stopped that are there to buy drugs in their community so there's a lot of things that will probably come to an end or you're a lot less\nUm you know police will answer those calls are always do their job but why should they continue to be proactive that every single thing they're doing is going to be scrutinized\nAnd Cassie very very quickly running at a time but one of the things that I I notice and I did talk about it here on a on the radio was this a program that the police have and I forget what it was called but basically what happens is they roam the streets and it's more like a community engagement kind of a situation where\nThis folks they once in a lifetime opportunity to own a piece of beautiful lake property that twin ... village on tips for late schedule your appointment by calling six one five five three five zero eight three seven you can find them on line that twin creeks T.

I'm being hard on the Saudis and not being hard on the king being hard on the crown prince\nNeed to make it look like I Am really going to make them suffer some consequences yet at the same time keeping that relationship alive and also making sure that the oil markets are stable\n\nBecause that can absolutely torpedo our economy so the president this is going to be what I Would say is going to be an incredible and I mean an incredible balancing act\nAnd so if you're President Trump you do have to be very careful and you know this isn't as easy as taking out\nYou know Michael ... and a horse face Stormy Daniels right that this is something that is a a lot more delicate so we're going to keep talking about this or not only today but in the days to come while we figure out exactly what happened with a ... show ... by the way speaking of which\nYou know I thought this was really interesting there was an article by a woman named Leslie Marshall now if you don't know who Leslie Marshall is or she is a liberal talk show host or and she also does a some commentary on Fox News\nAnd so she comes out now with this piece it's a headline here's the headline\nTrump calls Stormy Daniels horse face in a tweet why has this kind of insult become the new norm\nNow\nLet's not forget we have all these people on the left are calling President Trump sexist calling President Trump's ... an abusive and a bully and all these other things can I just remind these folks that Stormy Daniels wrote a book about the size of Donald Trump's\nPrivate parts\nIf I'm not mistaken she has an entire chapter on his quote unquote shortcomings so I Want to make sure that you understand the the lunatic logic of the liberals and the left it's okay for a porn star and they strip her\nTo come out with the book detailing apparently in no pun intended ... intended microscopic detail on the president's\nPersonal business and private parts\nYet he can't call her horse face in a tweet how does that make any sense whatsoever how is it the Kathy Griffin can can hold a decapitated bloodied ahead of Donald Trump and that's OK on the left but he simply call somebody horse face\nAnd he's a sexist NA massaging is among many other things so that doesn't make any sense what so ever\nBut see this is what the left does this is what the media does is they have these these outlandish accusations against the President Trump and frankly conservatives yet for getting all of the important things that they have done\nYou know the other day on CNN if it was it was astonishing to even watch the things that happen over on CNN because you had Stormy Daniels and Michael ... is on there as well and you know that these are these are two that are getting all kinds of media and I'm watching this interview with Stormy Daniels\nAnd she actually has an entire segment where she's expressing remorse that in her book she talked about\nThe president's private parts\nYet at the same time she's talking about the president's private parts\nAgain it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and this is a kind of commentary this happening on CNN\nThen you've got my ... we all know about this guy is the president called him what a three but\nThree ... lawyer shy stir and in all these other things in it to me I think we all know what happened ideas and yesterday I talked about this in great detail where you've got a lot of these folks on the left you got a lot of these Democrats and the liberals who are terrified that Michael have an id\nIs going to be the new face of the party of their party you don't you think about over the past forty eight hours\nHow many times the Democrats have absolutely shop themselves in the foot right you've got Michael ... who has now become the spokesperson for the Democrats and this is perfect for President Trump it really is because Michael ... is\nA three bit lawyer he is a ... and he is one of the most identifiable of critics of President Trump far out shining\nPeople like Cory Booker I'd be willing to bet that if us as the average American uh okay which name do you recognize a Cory Booker\nOr my ... they would say Michael have an id which name do you recognize Elizabeth Warren or Michael ... more people would say that they recognize Michael have an ID because of the fact that he has been everywhere are criticizing President Trump at every turn\nAnd then he comes out and and he has represented this woman sweating that Julie sweat neck and she has the outlandish claims and as I said yesterday really was a jump the shark moment for a lot of people because you started to look at this whole process of\nOf these accusations against a judge Kavanaugh and people said OK enough\nTo the point where on social media it was all about and where can we send a thank you cards care of Michael I have an id\nCourtesy of the Republicans so you look at the mistakes that\nThe Democrats have been making three weeks before the midterm elections you do have Michael ... and the Democrats will be the first one to tell you this guy has become one of the more identifiable figures of their party and that does not make them happy\nBut as I've been saying they are the ones that allowed this to happen they're the ones that gig gave this guy all kinds of credibility\nThen of course we had the absolute backfire of Elizabeth Warren at the at the now infamous\nSaid DNA test and we've got more on that straight ahead I talked about this an awful lot yesterday so I don't necessarily want to go back and revisit it today but\nSuffice to say at least to me\nIt seems like Elizabeth Warren are really took a gamble on\nFifth you got to hurry before they're all gone so what do you need firearms or furniture and appliances you need to hit on now to detain McCall they've

day of early voting and I'm\nWondering well come on and Bob Nash and Bob I've got to tell you you have had an amazing career in law enforcement thirty three year veteran\nOf metro Nashville police your past president of the fraternal order of police and you're also commander of the east precinct and as a and excited to have you on because a lot of folks are talking about ... amendment wind which is of course they're calling for\nThe people at Davidson county Nashville to a vote on this community oversight board one of the first thing that I Want to ask you a Bob you've been doing this and you had been doing this for so long\nHow is how his fighting crime in the city of Nashville changed over the last forty years\nOh gosh yeah well we just become used to be kind of this small big city and now we're big big city\nA traffic is increased so much a takes up a lot more time eating places and then working or crashes in the dumpsters get tied up with it we didn't before\nI I think are also like a everywhere in the country there's a casual and is out there\nUh and maybe a little disrespect or or to greater degree and I don't want to overstate that because we've been very fortunate here in Nashville has a great deal public support but there's a segment was really out there that are kind of shows the same just respect for law enforcement that you hear about the teachers having to pay for it\nYeah it is a quite a journey if you've been and then you have and I have as well I've been to a news and and talk shows and so on for\nOver Thirty years and so when you talk about this disrespect that has been appointed at a law enforcement over the past uh many years I think a lot of this has been fueled by a couple of things one is of course as social media and these activist groups because they really have become\nFar more organized and so when you know in years past when you were president of the fraternal order of police I I I think it's probably gotten even worse because\nOf a couple of things one yeah social media and two of these activist groups and there seems to be this narrative that a lot of these groups are trying to um put out there that the police departments are just riddled\nWith racist in a row cops who are running around shooting black people and of course you and I know that that is simply not true I Know you know you still have a lot of contacts within the police force that's got to have a a Denver dating a effect on the on the morale\nIt does it uh it it it's very frustrating for officers and we make\nThousands\nOf stops annually with absolutely no interest whatsoever of people of all faiths races genders colors um with absolutely no no incidents 'em\nAnd you know unfortunately to the social media things get nationalized I've seen several advertisements from ah the group is proposing this about talking about shootings in Chicago or shootings were burgers and that had nothing to do with the Nashville this is a terrific police department as well disciplined 'em\nAnd and you know the I was in my barber shop to every day [laughter]\nAnd the virus it would just teach people not to run from the police and I said truly running was not the issue\nIn those high profile incidents occurred here it was the fact that both of those young men were armed with a gun that raises the threat level and and causes extra attention or and and certainly influences or the ability of officers to to make decisions\nLike yeah you're right I mean in the case of ... Clemens we know that uh he had a gun he was going for the gun when the officer shot him and so I I think you're right in in a lot of these instances\nIt's not that they're running in that they're running and yet there is a a gun involved and so when we talk about\nThis community oversight board and whether or not the good people are buying Nashville in Davidson county will vote for and this community oversight board\nI Do understand that there there does need to be as some semblance of oversight over police department but we already have a system in place do you feel like this community oversight board will do more or less for the relationship between the metro police department and the communities that they serve\n... I certainly think is it designed it'll be detrimental to building the trust\nAnd respect between community and police that it purports to\nUh the members of this will have had no law enforcement experience they are not going to be representative of the whole community\nUh they're they're going to be nominated by a some community group I'm I'm with and they don't define what it takes to be a community group to eligible to nominate someone or\nWith the community if this community oversight board ultimately I ended up in play than I Am assuming that's going to lead to a lot of very controversial accusations against the police force when these kinds of things come up\nAnd to me it just doesn't seem like it's going to be conducive to a building that trust with the community\nWell I I agree if if if the people's\nElected for the board nukem with political agendas and the like and rosy good probability of that the way this is designed then yes I think they cause more controversy and undermined trust building efforts by the police department um\n[noise] so uh yes I agree with you um and it all depends on who gets picked on this board and again I think they they drew this uh uh it was definitely a committee that must have done this because you just uh unfortunately not really well defined about who serves what qualifications they have what qualifies as\nA community group that could nominate them\nOr what kind of qualifications you care to be self nominated right uh\nAnd you know and maybe maybe they meant to leave it vague so that they could sell this a community oversight board with people that have an anti police agenda and Bob I very much appreciate not only your service to the community but also being on the program you have good afternoon Bob ... thirty three year veteran of metro Nashville police force\nA lot of folks it is the first day of early voting for Nashville if you're heading to the polls you're going to be asked to vote on amendments one and this community oversight board and I'll tell you what as Bob was saying there's a lot of big news to death and so\nTo me I I think that there's runs the risk of being filled with a whole bunch of folks that are anti law enforcement and at least for me that is incredibly worrisome one fifty two on super talk Ninety nine seven WGN getting men to show when it tell you about my buddy Paul Winkler guy I like to say that Paul saved my financial life\nNow it all started with a phone call six one five eight five one Nineteen fifty now my first meeting with Paul Winkler I walked into his office\nAnd am anyone's classic I've got a ... a minute manila folder and it's got all kinds of\nStatements in it and and it was just a mess and so it it in fairness and Paul you know I took um a a couple of days to kind of go through all of this because my finances were a mess and so my first couple of meetings he told me what I needed to know you broke down my finances from a historical into focus on the future perspective\nAnd he really got everything in order and he told me the changes that he recommended that I make any and he told me exactly what he wanted to do and we did those and along the way I learned a lot to the market is always changing keep up with Paul Winkler he is a guy who's going to\nHelp you understand exactly what you need to know when we're talking about your finances and your retirement he's been helping middle Tennessee and like me and you for years\nOn the radio and in person and I've seen firsthand the punk and help you make sure that your investments are\nWhere they need to be but it all begins with a phone call six one side of the five one Nineteen fifty don't forget the radio show Saturday three to six on WGN in online anytime and Paul Winkler dot com\nNow listening to wash on Alexa say Alexa enabled a WPN scale and the play offs say Alexa hoping\nGetting paid a written they apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter\nWe need to bring them into this country back to greatness with aids lists male Macs a patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone promoting greater increases in muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing ...\nThe four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTake your manhood to the max by try your first dirty diaper bottle free not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word quick\nTo Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy not\nJust pay shipping and handling finally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with ageless male ... to it says please decrease you for your free bottle text quick\nSeventy died Seventy nine Seventy nine text Q.
