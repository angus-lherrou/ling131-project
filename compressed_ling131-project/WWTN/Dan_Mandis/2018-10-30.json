burying it to get this morning in the wake of the deadliest anti Semitic attack in American history Caitlin talents with more\nWe know that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are going to join the president as well as the first lady Melania Trump but last night we were talking to officials that what this trip is going to look like they said it was going to be an understated visit\nMeanwhile President Trump says he will terminate birthright citizenship for the children of nuns grants with the stroke of this ten in an interview with reporters with accents on HBO the president said he's been advised he doesn't need a constitutional amendment to make the change\nSo right now we've got the main caravan which has about what seven thousand people or so and he is right by the way I've got to an article here and it does show that the number of people in caravan number one\nIt is beginning to dwindle how many will ultimately make it to the United states I I really don't know what we do know is that they're getting rides here and then when they see a lot of the media they'll say stop the buses stop the trucks and everybody gets off and then they start walking towards the border because everybody loves the camera moment\nThere is now and this is all over the news today in case you haven't heard it as second now there's been a second my grand caravan armed with guns and bombs and it is storming the Mexico\nYeah\nSo you got all these people that are hyperventilating over the fact that we're sending our military to the border to support the border patrol well there is a second Margaret caravan according to a number\nOf different sources and they are believed to be armed with bombs and guns they've crossed into Mexico despite a huge a police presence and and that's one of the questions that I posed a while back is okay so what are we supposed to do with these folks\nAre we really supposed to start shooting them I don't want to shoot anybody I don't want to shoot these folks this caravan of a coming into our country we just need to keep them from coming into America and one of the things that the president said last night\nSome audio on this he's talking about how he wants to build a huge tent cities just outside of a border and that's where they're going to wait while we figure out who gets in here legally and who does not get in here legally and frankly those intensity is probably better than the conditions that they're living in in Honduras\nSo there's that aspect of it as well and I guess the other question I Would ask is okay so if we're going to have this tent city that is going to be in Mexico by the way well then are we going to be responsible for feeding all of these folks in in school the novel of these folks\nLet's not forget I open up the show yesterday talking about how uh Mexico offered all of these are all these caravan folks\nThe opportunity to get educated they offer them food they offer them water the offer them housing they offered them jobs\nThey all said no they said we're going to go to America and that's what they're hell bent on doing is coming to America\nSo talking about the second group the folks that most of them are from Honduras and some of these are from Guatemala as well\nSo what they're saying is they are far more unruly than the first caravan that is on its way to America and so there are far more unruly than the first that crossed a Guatemala's interior ministry said Guatemalan police officers that they were injured\nWhen the migraine group broke through border barriers on Guatemala side of the bridge\nAnd they're attacking the Mexican authorities they're attacking them with rocks they're attacking them with glass bottles they're attacking them with fireworks as a matter of fact\nWhen they broke through the gate on the Mexican and but they were finally pushed back in some allegedly carried guns and fire bombs\nNow one of the things I Would say is OK what they had guns and firebombs then why didn't they use them on the Mexican authorities but it sounds like the reason why they didn't just because the Mexican authorities\nThey didn't necessarily give them as much pushback is perhaps they expected so they're keeping their powder dry for another day and we all know what happened a couple of weeks ago when these are the first a caravan that is making its way towards our southern border they broke through those barriers\nAnd here they calm\nSo for Shepard Smith to sit there and say quote unquote they're not coming for you I again I I truly believe that he's missing the point I'm I truly believe that he is just being as usual as sanctimonious condescending arrogant self\nBut there is just a bit of hostility in the way that he said it\nMexico authorities said migrants attack ads agents with rocks glass bottles again fire works as well Mexican interior secretary of this guy's name alfonzo Prieta\nLimited what he called a second to violent attempt to storm the border accusing people of placing the elderly and pregnant women and children at the front of the caravan putting them at risk of being crushed\nSo I'm just telling the this is what's out there are folks and and so Shepard Smith he can say anything that he wants I don't think that there is a I don't think there is the mentality\nHere in America amongst the people who want our immigration laws enforced I don't necessarily think that this is a situation where we're all going to take our our torches and pitchforks down to the border ourselves and and do all this stuff no I just think that we want our immigration laws enforced and we made\nMade a statement in twenty sixteen\nWe went in legal immigration and a lot of these folks who are coming up with this a caravan they went into our country one way or another let me ask you a question\nSo early on it was it was discussed how these folks they simply don't have any paperwork at all so we supposed to grant asylum to a bunch of folks who we don't even know who they are I realize that's what we've been doing all along well guess what that's the problem\nThey talk about how the second second migrant caravan including members believed to be carrying these bombing bombs and guns across into Mexico on Monday despite this huge police presence in you know my theory on on Mexico they're just kind of letting these folks go\nThat's what they're doing by the way did you see the other or the other big controversy over the last couple of days\nSo I forget who was on Fox News somebody said Brian kill me I think it was by and kill me\nHe talked about the fact that there's a worry because a lot of these migrants and these refugees whatever you want to call them\nThey don't have their inoculations and so this was yet another situation where we know this is what the media does what the media does is they will try to shame you into submission\nAnd so now there is this the discussion there's this talk about how these folks they don't have all of their ... vaccinations they don't have inoculations and we have schools are around America\nWho won't even let the kids into the school if they don't have their proper vaccinations or inoculation but we're not all these people into our country\nThat's also a problem and it's a very legitimate concern it really is\nSo these are all problems that are realistic in nature the these are real world problems that are these caravans bring into the United states\nAnd just to recap some of the things that we've talked about on this show for what last a couple of weeks\nWe also know that a whole bunch of these folks have been deported before\nWe could talk about the drug runners we could talk about the inability of a lot of these folks to assimilate we could talk about the crimes and the gangs and MS Thirteen we could talk about the gun running I mean we could talk about all of these things\nBut first Shepard Smith this is a guy who it's almost like he's reading the news in these digesting the news and he's reporting on the news\nBut he's simply does not understand that these folks they do pose a real threat they most certainly do and so for for him to\nSo condescending lay and sanctimonious leak speak down to the audience of Fox News like we're just a bunch of paranoid paranoid more ...\nIt makes me wonder why he even wants to still work there because it seemed like he has just a lot of hostility towards the audience let me play this for you one more time\nThe migrants according to the Fox news reporting or more than two months away if any of them actually come here [noise] but tomorrow is one week\nBefore the midterm election\nWhich is what all of this is about\nThere is no invasion\nNo one's coming to get you there's nothing at all to worry about\nYou're too old for a member you know this sounds like it sounds like when you have a you know four five six seven year old and they have a bad dream\nAnd so then said child wakes up and you're trying to talk for a child down and say it it's okay there's no boogie monster there's no bogeyman under your bed or in the closet or whatever it is no it it's all going to be okay\nThat's almost the tone that shepherd is ... is using as he speaks to the Fox News' audience now as we all know\nAh there's a lot of folks on Fox News and there's a lot of folks and talk radio and there's a lot of conservatives who are supporters of President Trump and we're not the pitch fork and torch types we're simply not\nBut we also recognize the very real world ramifications of having all of these migrants allowing all of these migrants into what our nation which is supposed to be a a nation of laws\nAnd again we can talk about how they apply for the the asylum and then they are able to come into this country they use it as a key to come into the United states and then they disappear\nThere's a number of different angles that we could talk about there was a number of different ways in which Shepard Smith is wrong along the same lines we of course have a lot of the uh people talking about how ah the president\nInformation view of opinion driven this is ... news talk leader super

know we know that there's a lot of people a lot of folks who are conservative by the way and ah there's a lot of people that are of the thought I'm One of them to the\nRobert Mueller investigation is a witch hunt certainly we know that President Trump himself is no fan of the more investigation there's a lot of people\nWith an R next to their name who are conservatives who think the Robert Mueller

if these accusations are\nIf they if there's any truth to them if there's any credibility to them because certainly we've seen over the past four or five six weeks\nWe've seen a women come forward with baseless allegation that had had no credibility whatsoever so now Mueller apparently last week he heard some uh he got some news that there was going to be a woman is going to come after him with

management\nMy story began with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I hurt a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in debt and you need help coal trinity at one eight hundred seven nine for over four three something\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the number and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nOf what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nCalled trinity a one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something that's one eight hundred seven nine for oh four three seven\nRun like a girl is a nonpartisan hot cat it's a documentary on the unprecedented number of women running for office in the twenty he mid term election\nWant to hear what it's like to run like a girl in such a heated political climate last year we marched this year we run [noise]\nWould want find us on apple ... gas or wherever you listen to your high gas\nHenderson bail Nashville\nYou were talking about I mean I [noise]\nThat afternoon it as one o'clock I'm Pamela fair with your top story a man with thirty two warrants from three middle Tennessee counties has been arrested this morning\nDuring a joint FBI operation this after mount Juliet police officer or an FBI agent and two undercover mount Juliet officers arrived at home towns studios and sleeps on Murfreesboro pike did take Robert Bush into custody ... tried to get away by ranting police patrol cars with his pickup truck\nI mean listen to that so I Believe that when the president talks about how the the media in the press they are the enemies of the people I think what he means is\nThat when you listen to that kind of questioning from Allison camaraderie by the way one of the things I think is it is fascinating and I think I put this link on the damage your Facebook page\nOne of the things I thought was interesting was her leading question the first question out of her mouth\nWas who do you blame besides the gunman that was her first question\nHad nothing to do her first question should have been what did you experience and and these kinds of things I tell us about the people that you've lost you know honor the victims something like that but she went to the ...\nThey didn't respond to vote because you know that's what that question was all about writing you know that what you wanted this rabbi to say this rabbi Jeffrey Maier she wanted him to say oh it's all about the the words into the divisiveness of President Trump that's what it's all about\nAnd he didn't take the bait\nBut when you have the media whether it's a Andrea Mitchell\nOr Allison ... and they're asking these kinds of questions they these questions that are so incredibly leaving where clearly they want this rabbi or the person then went to the synagogue I played that audio a few minutes ago\nClearly they want these people involved in this horrific American tragedy\nTo say things that would support their narrative that this is all about President Trump and how he is responsible\nFor their shooting in Pittsburgh\nSo when the president says the media's oppressed\nThey are the enemy of the people I think that's what he means\nBecause what they're doing is they are the ones that are fanning the flames of hate\nThey're the ones that are fanning the flames of divisiveness you know as wrapping up the the previous hour ... one of the things that I I was talking about was the fact that you just heard Alison come around to talk about this about the rise in a white nationalism the rise in anti Semitism you know these kinds of things\nAnd one of the things that the president said last night on Fox News was yeah I Am absolutely a nationalist I Love my country\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that\nBut the media again true to form their screaming about nationalism versus white nationalism and they're trying to once again I Swear the president does it stop purpose\nAnd and so the media what they're doing is they're hyper focused on the president's embracing of nationalism always doubling down it all these kinds of things\nAnd so when you look back and you look at the fact that\nNinety four Ninety five percent of the media's coverage of the president is not only skewing negative but it's like what I just played for you then my question would have to be this\nWho when you look at\nThe combination of soundbites like the ones that I just played for you either from Andrea Mitchell or from Alice in camera rada when you hear the way that they are they are skewing the facts when you when you hear the way that they are desperately\nTrying to lead the witnesses if you will lead the people that they're interviewing just say negative things about President Trump to do whatever they can to to fanned the flames of divisiveness to fanned the flames of hatred\nMy question would be could you say that the media is the enemy of the American people because they are the ones that are promoting divisiveness they are the ones the media they are the ones that are promoting hatred\nAnd we think are\nYou know they have a white hot hatred for President Trump you know that they absolutely celebrate any thing that will paint President Trump in a negative light I mean good lord we could talk about that or the whole explosives thing from last weekend in that van with all the Trump stickers\nAbsolutely refusing to to even think about the possibility that this is this is something that to some sort of a a leftist operative may have taken part in or plant right before the midterm elections\nSo for me the more that I watch the media and we've certainly seen this over the past couple of years\nAt the more that we see how they are fanning the flames\nOf divisiveness how how they're throwing gasoline on the fire every single day and when her with and things like what we saw over the weekend happened how they will go out of their way to try and blame President Trump or blame deplorable or blame the rise in anti Semitism in all these other things\nOn the president you know the last time I checked I haven't heard the president say anything\nAbout white nationalism he hasn't said anything about any anything like that\nDog whistles or otherwise 'cause that's the thing that that the media keeps trying to say is that oh the president it's a you know when he says he's\nHe's embracing nationalism if the dog was All right we played that for you or that audio forty last week it's a dog whistle and his whole wink wink nod nod as as the president is is they're talking about how he is embracing nationalism is a wink wink nod nod to do to do what\nTo go into a synagogue and started shooting people this guy was a Donald Trump hey there\n[noise] so for the love of Pete man when\nYou say that the president I Want to think about this\nSo you've got the media and what they've been doing for the past week or two is talking about how the president when he says that he is embracing nationalism they are assigning their own definition of nationalism\nTo their definition of white nationalism and saying yeah they look the president is a is embracing white nationalism didn't\nGet a bracing nationalism there was a big difference between the two well not to the media to the media it's all about wink wink nod nod no no no no no when the president came out and he said he embraces nationalism that was a dog whistle to the guy that shot up the synagogue\nThat's what the media is doing so when you say when the president says that the media is the enemy of the people of America I think when you talk it out\nWhen you look at what the media is doing when you look at how the media spins when you look at how the media plays these things out when you look at how the media do whatever they possibly can\nFor their narrative that Donald Trump as an anti Semite they they will present stories in a certain way they will find their own meaning to the things that Donald Trump says\nTo to continue to what I Would say as they continue to try and implement some sort of fear in the American people from what everything that President Trump says he is the one that is\nThat is fanning the flames of divisiveness when it's actually them but we know that that's what the media does we know that what the media likes to do if they like to do certain things but then\nBut then blame the president for doing those things whether it's you know screaming about anti Semitism or any number of things I mean there's there's a whole a conversation regarding\nOr the Caribbean and I don't know if I have enough time to get into this now but just a headline so when he talked about the caravan and when you talked about how the media is portraying President Trump as somebody who is trying to use the caravan to or I Would say fan fear\nThe Trump supporters right so the president has been saying oh we've got this caravan coming over and they're you know these are people who are you know drug a drug dealers and MS Thirteen and all these other things that we know is the fact\nWell the president is stating facts when he talks about the caravan embedded in this caravan or are people that are most certainly could be and our members of MS Thirteen and these are these are people up to no good I I'm Sorry but that is just the fact\nSo the media will say oh the president is trying to he's trying to bring a bunch of theories try to to raise a bunch of fear into his er into his supporters and that'll drive them to the polls on the uh and during for the midterm elections and I do understand that but the media is doing the same thing\nBecause the media in saying that the president is invoking fear what they're doing is they are themselves trying to bring a whole bunch of fear for uh for the American people into President Trump\nSo people are supposed to be afraid of President Trump because he is talking about the the caravan he is talking about the ...\nLet's take us threats that are in that caravan\nAnd so if I both sides but especially on the media\nThe media is trying to one more time what they're trying to do is assigned meaning to what the president is saying while they themselves are doing exactly what they are accusing the president\nAnd it all you see in these center I'm Pamela for with your story I

nine seven WG and very quickly so birthright citizenship thanks So Paul Ryan you just heard um\nBut by the audio of wind a whole bunch of folks on the left and the wife screaming that President Trump says he is going to end birthright citizenship citizenship here's what the Paul Ryan had to say\nYou cannot in birthright citizenship and executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear\nYeah and so here's what the president had to say I guess this was in an interview a last night and this is on or act CEOs\nAnd the president telling a HBO that he has run the idea of ending birthright citizenship by his counsel and plans to proceed with the highly controversial move which will certainly face legal challenges and um he says well\nI originally he said that he was told that it could happen with the constitutional amendment but now he's saying that you don't need a constitutional amendment he could do it by executive order and it goes on and on and so ultimately I think part of what the president\nNeeds to do is I I'm not sure I agree with the president wanting to change the fourteenth amendment this is something that I Would need a lot of work and a lot of discussion here in America but I but I think\nWhen you look at some of the abuses and I think this is why Americans can get they can have a tendency to get so angry with the illegal immigration so\nWhen when we talk about birthright citizenship you do realize and I think the president probably knows that there are instances of outright abuse of birthright citizenship and and for example when I Lived in Los Angeles I heard about this\nAnd it's only continue to proliferate but there are places in Los Angeles where people come in from Asian countries that places like China for example\nAnd they come in here on some sort of a visa and then they have their babies purposely in America\nThere by granting there these are kids than they are able to become a citizen of the United states because they are born in America\nAnd this is something that's been going on for a long time and and so it's it's a whole um it's a whole process that they go through but it but it's a whole industry out there and I'll I'll find the uh the couple of articles and presented to you at a\nAt two o'clock about two or five all find the or the information on it because this is something that has been going on for a long time again in Los Angeles where you have it it's almost like an industry where women will come in from other countries and and they are eight eight and a half months pregnant\nThey all stay at this particular apartment complex or maybe they're renting a home\nAnd they're real close to giving birth and so they come into America and they have their babies and then of course those kids that are as citizens of the United states and it's a whole industry and so I Would say that yeah that is that is abusing\nThey beheaded scores and scores of people they burned scores of people they would tie them to a multiple cars you remember that there was like every single day ISIS was was coming up with new and creative ways to kill people you remember this\n\nThere was one moment one one died that was tied to multiple cars and like his right arm was was tied to one car and the other arm was tied to another car and in both car sped in different directions and then with his arms off\nDo you remember when they when they drowned a bunch of guys in cages that is what the left thinks\nOf Trump supporters is that we are quote unquote I equally is as equally hateful as a radical Islamic terrorism and and and ISIS\nAnd Jake Tapper from CNN doesnt bother to oh I don't know call her out or or push back on that are really\nSo not only do I find obviously the words in the comments of Julia I offer whatever the hell her name is I heard her statement is ludicrous\nIt is hateful but nobody's pushing back on it except for you know people on the right\nI mean I could sit here all day long I think to an entire hour I just that one statement but I Can't it's one fifty two I'll I'll continue that conversation\nAre coming up in the next

citizenship for the children of non citizens and the legal immigrants with the stroke of his pen\nIn an interview with reporters with access on HBO\nThe the narrative of the Caribbean I've been telling you ad nauseam about the care of and I understand that\nA lot of people myself included feel very passionate about the caravan and the folks that are coming are heading towards a our southern border through Mexico and and this is something that for the president has been I Would say at winning narrative\nIt really has just again take out that the human toll\nBecause I could go on and on about the dishonest media and everything else but just\nFrom the from the pictures that we're seeing and from the stories that we're hearing about the caravan and about what our own department of homeland security is saying\nThis is a a caravan that is headed towards America and it is filled with people that have been deported before we know that there are people that are in these caravans\nThat are quite frankly up to no good we know that despite what Shepard Smith and others will say I just wonder why it is that the president is deciding to do this now why is he talking about birthright citizenship now\nBecause if you're going to start talking about illegal immigration\nI Would be willing to bet that if you did and I haven't actually seen a poll on how most people feel about this the the thousands of illegal or while they're not illegal aliens yeah what's it come into our country that'd be illegal aliens but these migrants\nThat are coming from places like Honduras El Salvador Guatemala and the like I'd be willing to bet did it as people look at these photographs and and they hear the stories and they see the video\nOf thousands of people not only yes indeed walking across the desert but we know what's happening we know that as as they're as they're walking across Mexico what is really happening if they're they're grabbing rides and and then once they see cameras then everybody gets off of their rides it do they get out of the back of the pickup truck or whatever it is\nAnd they do what they're doing which is a than walking and getting in front of the cameras and and doing everything they can to push forward their narrative\nThat what they are they're just looking for jobs they're just looking for opportunity they're looking for medical care they're looking for everything that as I told you yesterday Mexico is offering them\nAnd what did they said it mass the president of Mexico I told you about this yesterday he the president Mexico\nMexico came out and said I Am going to offer you a deal I'm going to offer you jobs I did offer you schooling we're going to offer you food shelter medical you\nName it and in mass they all said no it is America or bust\nAnd so for a lot of people including me this was this was even more proof that are for these folks that are trying to make their way into the United states you know what there I Would say they're looking for a couple of things one is\nUh if you're a migrant you're looking for the services that America offers and so there's benefits and everything else that some of these folks will get including\nA free schooling and so forth but the other thing that that is happening is the Democrats they absolutely want these folks to come in and and they absolutely want to be the party that is a allowing them to be assured end because it's all about votes\nSo earlier in the program I played this audio for you this is this a shepherd Smith and and the reason why I'm playing this for you is because I think it it's\nIt's indicative of what even though shepherds on Fox News\nI think that it's indicative of the narrative of the left and how they are trying to portray this caravan coming into America and and how the left they're portraying those of us who have very legitimate concerns about this caravan about how we're just\nWe're paranoid and we're we want to grab our pitchforks and torches and we want to head down to the border ourselves to protect that listen to the tone of shepherd Smith tomorrow\nThe migrants according to Fox News reporting or more than two months away if any of them actually come here [noise]\nBut tomorrow is one week\nBefore the midterm election mhm which is what all of this is about there is no invasion\nNo one's coming to get you\nThere's nothing at all worried about so when they did this to us got us all riled up in April remember the result was fourteen or is\nWhere America we can handle it died so\nLike I said wait till the electorate and Jennifer Griffin is on it\nNow has a shepherd Smith and throwing to Jennifer Griffin but listen to listen to how arrogant he is listening to how sanctimonious he has lifted out condescending Shepard Smith is and and that's on Fox News folks\nAnd so a lot of people understandably including myself when I heard him and his little speech there I was actually insulted\nNow there's a couple of things that I Would I Would point out first of all I shut up our own department of homeland security has said that there are people in this caravan that are indeed up to no good there are people that are coming in\nFrom uh some of these other nations I Guatemala and also Honduras and El Salvador they do have connections to MS Thirteen\nWe can talk about gun running we can talk about drugs we can talk about all of these things but this is quite frankly common sense if you do anything that's been going on on the border you know that there are people that are coming into this country trying to come into this country and they are up to no good up to no good they have all these different um\nThey have all these different things that they're trying to accomplish here in America and I've just named you just a few of them\nSo for Shepard Smith to come out and say they're not coming to get you man that made me mad it ... it really did and so when I heard that I absolutely want to do a play the audio for you but the other thing that I Would point out to ship there\nIs that if you if you do a little bit of research you'll see that there are a lot of folks who come in and they apply for an amnesty\nAnd so then they are in this country as they're applying for an amnesty and ultimately they're not granted amnesty but what it is is it the ticket into the United states of America and they simply disappear we've talked about this ad nauseam folks\nAnd then you never know where they end up you really don't so he talks about how there were what fourteen people arrested that's all good and well but what about all those people that come into our country whether it's in this caravan or the next caravan on by the way you've heard about the the next care of and I hope you have any way\nYou know where it is they have all kinds of weapons and they're they are incredibly unruly soon as the things that I've been saying is that it it's it's not about how we handle this caravan\nIt it's about the next caravan and the caravan after that we've been hearing about how there are numerous caravans are to be that are going to be coming from these nations
