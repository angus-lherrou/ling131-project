credibility has been challenged by intimates people that knew the Kennedy well as a classmate when it's temperament has been revealed in an emotional moment oh stop it [noise] where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of seeking a crime in alternatively [noise]\nNot whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial to fall from Italy had hung up questions being raised that we should not move onto another candidates\nRight now I'm running list put together by the Heritage Foundation and the federal society move on to another candidate because all the movie the Supreme Court is not an entitlement [noise] just because he went to jail or prison in your class doesn't entitle you to the Supreme Court\nOh interesting so so now he's success shaming that's with Cory Booker that's what the Democrats are now resigned to is success shaming Brett Kavanaugh\nThat this is a sacred institution\nAnd the people that should be on it whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy at all the people who should be on the Supreme Court [noise]\nTo preserve the integrity of the court\nSo it's interesting the bookers talking about the integrity of the court when it is the Democrats that have absolutely damaged and destroyed the integrity of this whole process\nBy bringing forth woman after woman after woman with the most outlandish claims and giving them credibility even do they have not [noise]\nAnd be beyond reproach of these before park and ride\nRight so these difficult part is in times what's making these the part of the time so difficult is the fact that we have the Democrats and Cory Booker right there\nSaying regardless as to whether or not Brett Kavanaugh is an innocent or guilty the president should move on from Kavanaugh and move on to another candidate clearly what that would do is that would bring the whole confirmation process past the midterm elections\nI think it really seems to be obvious to anybody who is watching this whole situation is that the Democrats they have nowhere else to go because they put all of their hopes and dreams in blocking Brett Kavanaugh into the hands of Christine Ford\nAnd of course we all know exactly what happened again it's another day and there is a a another slew of stories that are absolutely damaging her credibility\nYet Booker has nothing to say about that not one thing\nIt's all about the temperament of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so one of the things that you have to look at as you watch the Democrats continue to ... about\nIs that they're simply trying to divert your attention from what is truly the importance of the loss of credibility they continued loss of credibility of Christine Ford see now we talked about this yesterday earlier\nWe're talking about how the more that the damage to the credibility of Christine for the the more that we see that\nThe more that the Democrats are screaming about the pointed a confrontation with Brett Kavanaugh as he was defending himself against the worst of allegations\nAnd so the more that the Democrats are screaming about his temperament the more that the Democrats are are talking about some of the things that Kavanaugh said in his defense in his so called aggression\nAs he was denying and trying to refute all of these nasty claims that have been going on against him that's what they're now trying to focus on has nothing to do now with the allegations it's all about his behavior\nThat's what they're trying to say\nAnd the more that I hear them as they again try to sort of ... about in this whole thing the more that not only Christine forward is losing her credibility but also I Would say obviously the credibility of the Democrats are also is a suffering quite a lot\nNow one of the things that the Democrats are screaming about is this quote from Donald Trump last night\nWhen he's going thirty six years this\nI had one beer [noise] right I had one\nWell do you think it was it was what I'll do it how did\nHe get home I Do remember how'd you get there and I remember right where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know\n[laughter] and so now the Democrats are absolutely hyperventilating on President Trump is talking about how she had one beer you know first she herself she says oh I've been drinking and and and I had been\nYou know little bit out of it herself and then she comes out and she says well I only had one beer and so you really don't know it's like\nTo try to juggle jello you ever try and juggle jello I have and it's not easy because it's always shifting well that's what's happening with Christine forward\nAnd and all of these are all of these changing stories and the changing narrative of the Democrats and so now you've got people on Twitter and uh also all sorts of social media who are screaming about how the president was mocking a sexual assault victim\nWell I Would say first of all the fact that Christine Ford says that she is a sexual assault victim doesn't necessarily mean\nThat she is if they've got all these people attacking President Trump on Twitter when the truth of the matter is they're using this this what I Would say ... is President Trump's simply speaking common sense but they're using this comment to say that he is mocking a sexual assault victims\nJust conveniently forgetting about the fact and ignoring the fact that we have more damage to her credibility and she herself came out and others have come out and said as well well this is exactly the reason why sexual assault victims don't come forward\nShe says this is why I was terrified that to the end I didn't want to come forward I was terrified of coming forward because she knew that you would be either mocked are made fun of or whatever it is\nI think that the reason why the president is sewing Bolden is because of the fact that she has so many holes in her story the reason why she was so terrified is because she knew that her story had a whole bunch of holes\nAnd she has no answers and so when President Trump talks about how well how many years that you have how did she get home you know all add to the list that was that one little sound bite with all the twenty seconds long that everybody on the media and on social media is hyperventilating over\nSo I'll go ahead and add to the list of questions that we all know\nHow did you get home that was what President Trump asked them who was that the party well do you have no idea and drone named witnesses can cooperate your story\nHow much did you have to drink a lot or one beer that second door talked about this a lot yesterday was it do to your claustrophobia and Pete TST or was it all about using your home as a rental space for another therapist and circumventing zoning laws where you live\nWhy did you say hello to your suppose that attack or mark judge when he was working at the grocery store after\nHe supposedly attacked you which makes no sense whatsoever or you're really afraid to fly clearly no you weren't you lied why would you not allow the Senate Judiciary committee to come see you in California for story keeps changing\nThat's why she was terrified to come forward because she knew that her story lacks credibility and I don't think that anybody on the left including Christine forward including Dianne Feinstein including Chuck Schumer I'm reasonably certain that no one on the left expected the White House\nAnd the Republicans to say yes please tell us your story\nShe can't even name what year this attack supposedly happened in she never mentioned his name Brett Kavanaugh once in all these years the point I'm making is that she was terrified to come forward because she knew that her story couldn't hold up\nAnd now the latest development today you've been hearing both Michael and Brian talk about this we have this ex boyfriend of her saying that well yes she has actually assisted someone in passing a polygraph test in direct contrast to what she said in front of the Senate Judiciary committee\nPerjury\nHe also by the way she said that he had she had no fear the boyfriend said that she had no fear of cramped spaces while living in a what five hundred square foot apartment and no fear of flying even on a ... years ago\nNow we know that this woman were mirrors the woman from Gail has a bunch of holes in her story we all know that that that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her she's got a bunch of holes and and witnesses said nope never happened\nA few other said yeah they heard about it but no real witnesses and of course what Nick at this one is just laughable she's now got an X. saying that she wanted to have sex with multiple guys\nOr their boyfriends coming out as well saying she threatened to kill his unborn child then wife and family so this is getting to the point of ridiculous\nWhich is why if that Cory Booker at a whole bunch of folks on the left\nAnd they're saying you know maybe we need to change our tactics a little bit maybe we need to to talk about the rather appointed a testimony of a bright Kavanaugh how he was he was defending himself too much against the Senate Judiciary committee that's really the narrative today it's when\nIs definitely cooling down so you need to make sure that your heating unit is ready for the long winter ahead so would you want

[noise] given the White House press corps a little bit of what four so we've got some uh audio on that and she's telling it like it is you know one of the things that\nSarah Sanders is saying to the White House press corps listen what the Democrats are doing and you know she's not saying anything that we haven't been saying I'm On talk radio for oh I don't know the last two years and that is that the resistance and now everything's been happening with Brett Kavanaugh we know that's part of the resistance\nAnd she's saying whether it is a you know the um mainstream media whether it's the Democrats trying to hijack the Supreme Court nomination and confirmation she's speaking the obvious which is the fact that the Democrats are really trying to silence\nVote of the American people from the vote of twenty sixteen and I think that that's pretty obvious now for the mainstream media of course to deny that I I think is\nSomething that the media needs to look at themselves in the mirror collectively and they got to realize that they are part of that high jacking but they know that and they know that they're part of the resistance and it's pretty clear that most if not all of the American people at least the ones that pay attention\nThey're absolutely on to the mainstream media by the way\nHillary has come about now and she has a few things to say and I I did play some Hillary Clinton audio for you yesterday and it she's she's out there and she just continues to talk and and the more that she talks it it's almost like a Christine for\nThe more we hear about Christine

that is Hillary and you know she just it's almost like what you stopped talking that's all you have to do Hillary is is stop talking a but at least for me I appreciate the fact that she keeps gambling on and on because\nIf not for her incessant drawing on about the election of twenty sixteen about how much she hates Donald Trump clearly it's all part of the resistance and so Hillary talking about how President Trump speaks to quote unquote that America\nOr the or the Democrats trying to hijack the Supreme Court nomination\nThis is all fodder for folks like me and you to go out to the polling places in the mid term elections because that's what is ultimately incredibly important so whether it's Hillary whether it's Cory Booker whether it's Chuck Schumer you know what I'm thinking about doing\nOn my show on election day the mid term election day I don't even know what day where it's all supposed to go to the polls and for the midterm elections but whatever it is\nI think by just

I Believe the ruling prior to this is in is is against um you know the the administration and what they want to do as far as illegal immigration is concerned so I think that was\nPart of their goal the other part of their goal is to be these folks down so that nobody worth anything wants to show up and be on the Supreme Court yeah and I think that's a long term goal is to discourage anybody who has any kind of character from putting themselves in their family through this process\nAnd one of the things that I've been saying about this is with Brett Kavanaugh you've got a guy who clearly over the course of his lifetime has led from what I can tell a an exemplary life and all of a sudden now you've got all these folks that come out of the woodwork and say all of these lies about you know wonder he was pissed off and he was defending himself\nHe should have been buddy through I stand [laughter] I mean that's you know I don't know what we're going to do then\nIs all of that I I ended the show yesterday I don't know if you picked up on this may be that he probably to Adam but um you know what they were arguing about when that whole ice throwing thing happened ... was Kavanaugh and his friends were trying to figure out if if this guy in the bar was the lead singer of you'd be forty\nYeah ... yeah and and so they go ahead or read ... I Know right it's a guy comes off his what do you look at it and so that's when I said parents being thrown and then ...\nVery very funny and then we end up being the lead singer view before to look like you know it just turned out to a looked like the guy and the other thing that was funny is now the lead singer of you'd be forty\nIs out there talking about all of this and talking about how you know a cabin I as you know this horrible conservative and all these other things as you can imagine that's what the leasing review before\nAnd that was their last that was red red one was\nYeah I I think that was their only barreling down mentally up their hits and great [laughter] congratulations are irrelevant again just in the way that you didn't want to be relevant I saw the movie guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer what's interesting about this cell\nIs apparently and I don't know if you've heard about that you probably have the Planned Parenthood has been forcing cancellations screenings all across the country you're going to be at the regal Hollywood twenty seven tomorrow night have you heard any rumblings of Planned Parenthood wanting to come out here and and try and\nForce a cancellation I've not heard anything but see the movie doesn't open until a week from this coming friday so this is an early screening and they've done this and other screenings and it wouldn't surprise me if they showed up\nAnd they usually don't telegraph that they're going to show up so it may be fun you know you may have to walk through a line of protesters to get to the movie which will be interesting\nYeah it's interesting first of all it's fun to walk through the line of protesters 'cause it just makes it matter lawyer but they've had you know we're talking about the the crowd funding issues and they tried to market the movie but NPR didn't like the content of the ads if you remember that you had actors dropping out you had facilities refusing to rent their spaces out\nAt the filmmakers even had to deal with a lawsuit said the judge in this particular case\nFiled the lawsuit he didn't even want the movie made so when you speak to the folks from the movie tomorrow night when you're out at their regal Hollywood twenty seven and there's so much to talk about just from the the obstacles that they had to overcome to get this movie made\nWell they know that and John Sullivan who's one of the executive producers is good for a not a good freeze a friend of mine I Know him and and we've talked about other movie projects and he's got something else that I'll be able to talk about a few months that they're getting off the ground to which is really going to be cool\nBut he was also um uh he was instrumental in twenty six teams ... okay I ran into the same kind of stuff there I mean you you run into this all the time I mean I I help the folks with Atlas Shrugged and they they had a hard time getting a\nDistribution of the major distribution channels because people don't want this kind of stuff out there it really is scary because you think you know we live in a free and open society but a lotta times we don't and and they're gatekeepers when we had our moving inconsistent truth which is a pretty standard thing after its run in the theaters and it ran for eight weeks\nI had the Hollywood twenty seven um then we wanted to go to DVD and we wanted to put it on pay per view and one of the things we were trying to do is go to Netflix and go to ... and we got turned down by both of them now they're all these other movies out there that are pro global warming pro climate change\nA there are several they want to I think um I Can't remember the name of the several of them they have on Netflix and our movie grossed more than their movies did and the theatres yet they're on Netflix and we're not right of the really has no excuse other than ideology\nYeah absolutely so people can meet you meet the director tomorrow night what time and

Thirteen this is not some gruesome thing about abortions this is about the arrest than trial love Kermit guys\nNow it's ... it's more about it is I read it yeah it's about the cover up and and also about I'm not a crime movie it is in that in mind of an investigation and all the ... behind it\nDean king plays the lead detective on this yeah and and I think he his character was hesitant to investigate until they got into the abortion clinic and found all this stuff yeah and you know Tom Ridge the governor of the time\nOr was trying to block them from even investigating this thing so all of these are there's our ah our presidential alert or you're going to hit all your everybody's getting the president's Schuler there's a lady who's suing\nSo that we don't get these why because as

name Brett Kavanaugh wants in all these\nYears and now we have this acts\nFriend of hers saying well yeah she actually did assist someone in passing a polygraph test in direct contrast to what she said in front of the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nSo it seems to me like Dr Ford is not a victim it seems to me like Dr Ford is lying\nAnd there is um a lot of folks besides yours truly who will say that at least in my opinion her claiming to be a victim\nActually is somewhat shameful in the sense that there are true victims out there and maybe you're one of them they're true victims out there that have been through hell and back after going through real assaults\nSo the more that we hear about Christine Blasey Ford and the apparent why is that she keeps telling and the holes in her story that are becoming bigger and more frequent the the less deserving she is of that title victim\nSo here's the store and this is the big news today in a written decoration released Tuesday last night in a team by Fox News an ex boyfriend of Christine Blasey Ford oh\nThe California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault directly contradicts her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination to form a boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration\nAlso said Ford neither mentioned cabin out nor mentioned she was a victim of sexual misconduct\nThe time they were dating from about Ninety two to Ninety eight\nHe said that he saw Ford going to great lengths to help a woman he believed was her quote lifelong best friend\nPrepare her for a potential polygraph test he added that the woman Monica McLean had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office so that's a big question mark right there where she line\nWhen she was in front of the Senate Judiciary committee and did she commit perjury seems to me like this guy\nIs putting this on paper in a written a in a written statement\nThat's going to be a big question as far as her credibility goes now if there's anybody who's listening right now who still thinks that Christine Blasey Ford even before this allegation came out if you still have you thought that she had credibility than you know I don't know what to tell you\nBecause every single day and I just laid out all the reasons why she does not have credibility than\nYou know you probably don't think this matters one way or another you believe her no matter what but for people who are truly paying attention and really looking at whether or not this is true or not these accusations against a Ford\nI should say against Kavanaugh well I Would say\nThat I'm a number of what is it sixty Seventy percent of the American people as this story continues to unfold there now realize I'm realizing she is a full of BS and this is just more B. S. it's like there's this big pile of BS just keeps a stacking up by the way you further claims a boyfriend\nThat forward it never voiced any fear of flying even while the board a propeller plane and seemingly had no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment with one door\nApparently contradicting her claims that she could not testify promptly in DC\nBecause she felt uncomfortable traveling on planes as well as her ... suggestion that her memories of cabin I allegedly a cabinet as the legitimate salt prompted her to feel unsafe living in a closed in space or one without a second front door which still does it make any sense to me [noise] I was talking to somebody today\nOr somebody who I haven't spoken with in a in a while and and you know I asked her and she herself for somebody who was attacked or what twenty five or so years ago\nAnd asked her why so have you been keeping up with all this she said no she said and she somebody who's not necessarily political and she said that you\nKnow why in the world is this woman uh coming out with this now over Thirty years or from the legit or assault and so she hasn't been buying this for one minute\nAs I almost use that almost like a a benchmark if you're well are you know sort of an indicator as to where a lot of people in America are with this thing and that is that there was a lot of people\nWho were looking at this story and thinking okay so credibility knock number one is that it took her what over Thirty years is we all know to come forward\nAnd then as the whole continue to mount again at these holes are are getting better bigger and there's also a lot more of them the more holes that we find\nThe less credibility she has\nSo Chuck Grassley I mean he goes nuts last night he is sending a turn eastern sending attorney\nSounding like letters to her attorneys and here's what he had to say and appointed no holds barred letter last night that referenced the ex boyfriends declaration Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley demanded\nThat attorneys for forwarded turned over her therapist notes and other a key materials see last you know this is that with all of these um demands by the left for an investigation Chuck Grassley and the Senate Judiciary committee\nThey've been trying to get all the materials that they can so that they themselves\nCan finish and complete their own further investigation and the attorneys for Dr Ford refused to give them over\nAnd snow Grassley suggesting that she was intentionally less than truthful about her experience with polygraph examinations during Thursday's a Senate hearing\nSo here's what he wrote your continue continued withholding of material evidence despite multiple requests is unacceptable as the Senate exercises it's constitutional responsibility of advice and consent for a judicial nomination\nNow I Wonder if the reason why they're not giving up the evidence is because if they give these things up to the notes and the recordings and so on then it's going to poke even more holes in her testimony\nUnder questioning from experience sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell last week Ford said that she had never had any discussions with anyone on how to take a polygraph we just played you the audio\n\nAnd now we know that there is at least one boy friend who is saying well that's not necessarily true\nSo we'll have to see what happens we'll have to see if Grassley gets the material that day he is demanding\nAnd I think it says a lot that the attorneys for Dr Ford refuse to give up the notes the recordings the correspondence by the way between a supposedly correspondence between forward and the Washington Post as well\nSee the more that we find out about Christine forward the more this whole thing stinks\nAnd so when Sarah Huckabee Sanders says they she is a victim\nI'm getting to the point now where that just seems to be a talking point that's almost cover for the Republicans and with all due respect to President Trump and Sarah Huckabee Sanders I'm not sure if she is deserving of the title victim\nBecause it's becoming clear that she lied it's becoming oh so clear that her story is so full of holes in lax such credibility that continuing to call her a victim\nFrankly is a disservice to the narrative and it's a disservice to\nA judge Kavanaugh now you could say and I'll give Sarah Sanders the benefit of the doubt here I guess but what she says the both of victims of the Democrats well what do you mean what I Would say is that if you want to paint her as uh\nIt can be in the sense that the Democrats are using her as sort of a a political political ... to try and take down ... um judge Kavanaugh and President Trump\nWell I guess\nBut the Democrats wouldn't be able to do this if it wasn't for her own cooperation\nRight anyway let let's listen to the the entire a sound bite of Sarah Huckabee Sanders I think those Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh a here we go again I
