suspicious package discovered in his city this morning in New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was appealing for calm we can't tell you how long this will go exactly\nWe have to be ready for any eventuality it might be hours it might be days it might be weak story spotted Neal mark is in New York says the device was discovered after being sent to actor Robert De Niro\nSo isn't it interesting how if you're somebody who is a a a conservative right then you are constantly and I mean constantly and I know because I'm a conservative\nWe're constantly badgered we're constantly harassed we are the ones that are the ... even though I've clearly Maxine Waters is the one that is throwing a all Trump supporters under this umbrella of this one suppose that person a Trump supporter\nWho sent these explosives now listen to how the hell describes this whole situation\nListen to how this is Frank this is so telling each of those targeted we're talking about Obama we're talking about Hillary Eric Holder John Brennan Maxine Waters I go on and on and we all know these folks each of those targeted\nHas been criticized repeatedly by Trump who could damage the attempted attacks as abhorrent during remarks from the White House East Room on Wednesday afternoon\nSo I Love how when the hill they're talking about this and they don't mention the fact that the people who receive these pipe bombs these explosives they hadn't been going after Trump incessantly\nIt is the constant drip drip drip of Trump painting that we had seen since he was elected president we know this but the way that the hill and and listen the hill at times they'll\nHave to have a very good things to say about the president but at times they'll have a bad things to say about the president is well\nI just thought that it was fascinating how they framed this whole discussion about how these folks who have been targeted had been criticized repeatedly repeatedly by Trump I Would be willing to bet that if you looked up say for example the comments of John Brennan and some of these other folks Eric Holder\nOr they are the ones that have done far more attacking on the president then the other way around\n\nSo when you talk about the mainstream media that is a great way to a that is a great example to pull out of your hat as one of those situations and I talk about this all the time don't I\nI talked about how you can look at these stories and it doesn't matter what story it is there are three different ways that you can cover a story you can cover it from a left perspective a right perspective and a perspective right down the middle just the facts and and nothing but the facts\nThat particular statement\nSaying that each of these targeted had been criticized repeatedly by Trump or tells me that what they're really doing is they're writing this from a perspective that is a really there to ... eight and assess the left in their narrative\nAnyway they go on to say that the president said we are extremely angry upset unhappy about what we witness this morning and we'll get to the bottom of it and it goes on and on so I did think it was interesting now where we are seeing it's almost like a cause the lab and yesterday are amongst the folks on the left\nIf you received one of these pipe bombs I said this earlier today off there and I thought it was um\nI I thought it was actually kind of funny I could just see a Chuck Schumer sitting around somewhere with his feelings kind of hurt feelings slighted because he wasn't I'm able to get his own little explosive device\nI said to him so we know that uh for a lot of people on the left if you received one of these then you have the ability now you have the permission to go out and you could just say whatever God for the GOP per second thing it is that you want to say\nAbout the president and his supporters and again one of the things that you have to realize is that the Democrats are taking this quantum leap again even if I'm going to play the game even if\nI'm going to play the game of the left in the media and say yeah this was somebody who is a Trump supporter you've got people like Maxine Waters and others who are saying that this is something that all Trump supporters agree with sending explosives to those who have been critical of President Trump\nOr listen to John ... now we know that John Case against somebody who has been incredibly\nIncredibly critical of a President Trump and I'll tell you something uh this is a guy who absolutely cannot stand the president his message and he is calling for\nA lot of people and this is something that we know that John Case it does we know that he is somebody\nWho was one of the last people in the Republican primary who was standing against President Trump and the president went after him a pretty pretty handily during the primaries and so he's talking about the fact that the president's message on illegal immigration is what's to blame for all this\nWe're now have a heightened sense of of of of threats and panic and ... they're going to be in your home but all this stuff and you really people are and what happens somebody out there who's\nWho's unstable does something crazy\nOkay so apparently according to John Case it and there's others I'm just using him as an as an example but according to John ... we should not have the conversation\nAbout the caravan the the horde of illegal immigrants or migrants that are coming up towards our southern border which by the way shrinking I got the latest on that but according to John Case it we shouldn't even talk about it\nBecause then what's gonna happen is we're going to get somebody all riled up that's going to lead somebody a Trump supporter to send some sort of a explosive were pipe bomb to a Democrat and so this is this\nIs the dialogue that's out there today\nNow we all know that this is something that both sides are commenting on but one of the things that I I find interesting and I opened up this\nTopic today this conversation here and they're opening moments of my program talking about how yesterday I really had this feeling that that this was a some sort of an operative for the left to the Democrats and what they're trying to do is they're they're trying to gin up sympathy for the Democrats and they're trying to\nI Would say rally up their base now I don't know\nWhat would I Do know is this it does add to their narrative one of the things that I don't know if you've noticed this 'cause we are we are all of folks who look at the news every single day we consume the news at the astonishing race here on WGN and the people that work here and listen to the radio station and we thank you for that\nIf you look at the media coverage and you look at the Democrats this whole thing yes it does allow than them to be victims it does allow them to be angry and sanctimonious I'm going to spare you the audio of Hillary and the ... from yesterday\nBut they've been playing the victim card all over again it is what they do\nWhether it's portraying judge Kavanaugh has a sexual predator so they on earth that Christine Blasey Ford and they talk about Trump terrorizing the media when really as we all know it goes both ways and now this\nNow one of the things that came up yesterday and you recall this was one of those\nUh conversations that really dominated all of a radio and TV yesterday on the news shows\nOne person asked me why I did not use the term false flag yesterday 'cause that's what a lot of people are saying this to be honest because there's a lot of people who have so over used the term false flag with no actual evidence\nThat to me that is a notion and a concept that is lost his credibility with them and so you know I didn't want to use that term necessarily but one of the things that I Do find interesting is that the media is now shaming those\nWho are simply asking questions about where these explosives where these bombs actually came from immediately if your somebody who were saying well wait a minute\nNone of this makes any sense you've got these explosives but they were set to Hillary there was sent to Obama they were sent to John Brennan\nAnd you know that this is something where the bombs never would have made it to those who they were intended to uh be sent to those bombs never would have made it to Hillary or an Obama or John Brennan or any of these folks\nSo all you're doing is you're asking questions how was it you've got what ten eleven of these things out there none of them exploded\nSaid that all of these questions out there and these are these are burning questions and questions that need to be answered\nBut if you're asking those questions then all of a sudden you're just lumped into this whole pile of a conspiracy theorists and the media is shaming those of us who are asking very simple questions because if you're asking these questions about again how none of the bombs the exploded\nAbout how the bombs would clearly not get to the intended targets about how they were sent in a way that nobody would get hurt and the tightening a couple of weeks before the midterm elections and about how it's so painfully obvious that this would help the Democrats that it is suspicious\nThat is what you're being shamed as a conspiracy theorist you're being\nDisregarded as a conspiracy theorists as opposed to just being somebody who is asking questions\nAnd so that's how the media is controlling the narrative here on this October twenty fifth of twenty Eighteen just a fascinating story line or will keep you up to speed on all the very latest Sarah ...\nIt'd be Sanders are coming up next time to play you some audio from her because you want to talk about somebody who is under the gun it is

discovered today to sent the former vice president Joe Biden in Delaware and one cent to actor Robert De Niro in New York correspondent Evan ...\nThey now have ten packages of some of which have already been found to be dangerous if possible bombs so they're trying to figure out how to isolate who might have sent they say the work is going on or trying to examine for example whether or not there's any DNA from a possible bomber\nAnd they're making their way to your country they want to enter into your country illegally even when you're vice president implored those countries\nPlease stop your people from coming into America stop your people from from heading making the dangerous trek across the desert or through Mexico towards our border they're going to be turned away and they do need to be turned away\nBecause we don't know who they are and that is a problem\nAlso said by the way as a result of the governments of Guatemala Honduras and Mexico a failing to stop the migrants the U.S would begin a cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid now listen to this you know how much these three countries got from America\nFive hundred million dollars from the United states in fiscal twenty Seventeen that money by the way funds programs that promote economic development and education you know what I Wonder every time I read this that they do we give hundreds of millions\nDollars this this is where I started getting passed right so every time I read about Guatemala Honduras and el El Salvador\nWe give them physically or twenty Seventy five hundred million dollars\nYou read about these nations and about the the horrific conditions that their educational systems Iran and you wonder where does that money actually do because there's a reason why\nThese folks are fleeing Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador enforced Mexico's well\nThere's a reason why they're fleeing and one of them is a lack of opportunity well if we're giving this five hundred million dollars to these three countries my question would be All right so how is that money being spent\n\nBecause clearly it's not being spent on the uh the educational systems in those country because it is horrible I mean you read about or some of these are programs in in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and it's clear that people are simply not being educated\n\nThat money also funds are programs that supports um economic development in yeah education well we know that the the biggest thing going for places like El Salvador Honduras Guatemala is drugs I mean we know that\nThey say side immediately clear how deep the cuts might go though the administration already has been pushing to a reduced the government's global aid and foreign operations budget by about thirty percent for fiscal twenty Nineteen blah blah blah blah blah you know let me ask you this I just all kinds of questions regarding this\nHow much could say for example a Chicago\nAnd these are districts in Chicago these these um these high school districts and these these uh educational districts and in Chicago and places like this Washington DC school districts how much could they use an extra five hundred million dollars\nNow this and I'm I'm I'm all for spending our money on our nation isn't there sort of what the president has been talking about by the way as he's been talking about uh being a nationalist\nYou know the the president over the last couple of days he's been talking about how he is bracing being a national is not a white nationalist folks for a national is there is a huge difference between the two I just look it up on Wikipedia like I did yesterday\nNo there's no nothing wrong with saying why don't we use that five hundred million dollars where essentially my opinion wasting it\nOn the governments have Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador we're wasting our money giving it to these nations because clearly these are a corrupt the nation's\nBut one of the things that you've got to realize is if we do not stop\nThe current caravan there will be more\nJust like we saw in Europe after the Syrian refugee crisis you had all these people are coming from Syria into Europe and then we started seeing after that first mass migration then the next migration and the migration after that it was millions of people\nMillions of Muslims heading into Europe that absolutely refused to assimilate\nNow my question is is if we allow these are six or seven thousand migrants than if they sneak their way into our country and they come in here illegally than they are indeed illegal aliens\nIf we allow that then what's next will we see yet another group another caravan of by illegal aliens and migrants to come into our country we're going to see even more\nThis particular news outlet is reporting there is fourteen\nThousand Honduran migrants headed to the United states\nSo not only can we not handle the seven thousand or so that are coming to America we certainly can handle another fourteen thousand nor can we handle the thousands that will come after that see what we see in this country and we know this is true\nWhen we exhibit strong\nBorder security when we even talked about enforcing our border laws when we even talk about protecting our border what we found is that the people in these nations like El Salvador like Honduras Guatemala\nThey simply don't want to come to our country they don't want to make that the long dangerous track across the desert because why\nWell the reason why is because they're afraid that they're just going to be sent back\nAnd so if we put the fear of God and the more the fear of trumping them and they simply don't come that's not a bad thing folks it's not a bad thing at all\nSo this particular report is saying that we've got you know six or seven thousand coming to our\nA border in what's going to be ultimately a huge showdown and so then whatever happens there we're going to see another fourteen thousand Honduran migrants heading to the United states according to this news outlet in um Mexico\nNow one of the things that we also know is that and yeah I'm laughing I'm laughing because I'm horrified or we also know that these these caravans they start out small or smallish and then they they grow they snowball as they come closer\nTo our own Porter so this thing is starting out at fourteen thousand migrants\nHow huge is that caravans going to be once it finally gets here we don't have room for all these people not only do we not have room but we also don't have the ability to take care of them we don't have the ability to\nConfirm their identity who they are one of the big storylines out of this whole thing the Honduran migrants they were coming towards our border and they purposely did not have any papers they didn't have any passports nothing I told you this whole thing\nIs paid for by George Soros this whole thing is a big middle finger to the president and to the vice president\nAnd to me and you people who\nWant our immigration laws enforced there's no other way to say it\nSo yeah this is a very big deal\nThe department of homeland security comes out and and says uh yeah a lot of these folks they are coming from places like Bangladesh and a lot of these folks I Do have ties to MS thirteenth they do have significant criminal histories this is the department of homeland security so yeah this is\nA very important now the very latest on the caravan is that it apparently is a growing smaller that is\nA good thing and we've been pointing out to you that this caravan part of this caravan is um ... it's not a hoax\nBut the media and the care of and they're not necessarily being truthful with everything that's going on\nBecause they're making it seem like they're they're walking all this way when in reality they're getting on buses and they're getting on trains or getting in pickup trucks and they're\nThey're grabbing a ride and then when they find the TV cameras in in the media then all of a sudden everybody starts walking because that is far better for the narrative that's far better for the cameras\nNow the Mexican government is now saying that it believed that uh some three thousand six hundred and thirty people are still heading north towards our border now on Thursday morning just this morning the Associated Press is saying that the number is it about four to five thousand\nAnd they are saying that it is shrinking due to\nExhaustion and worry about the dangers of the journey so apparently George shores didn't spend enough money for uh the bus as it is a one twenty on super talk very nine seven WGN\nDad to show by the way did you see that um this is so funny that you see that George Soros his son has now written this a big ol' op ed for I think it's the Washington Post\nSo I'm going to read for you just a couple of uh uh\nOf little passages owned by the way just very quickly homeland security is asking the Pentagon to send a at least eight hundred troops to the border by October thirtieth and so that is and now the very latest the um the invasion is shrinking\nBut then as the strength to it than\nA more and more people are jumping on board so that it's kind of a fluid number but what we do know is the president you know eight eight hundred with all due respect to the president and you know where I Am on a new legal immigration\nHave you been living with the pain of bulging or herniated discs are you in the midst of a world of hurt\nLike I was if you are what you

president has been up against by the way he continued last night to talk about the tone\nAs far to the larger national effort to bridge divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil yep as just stop the endless\nHostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores\nYeah I mean the president is is not saying anything new he's been saying this all\nAlong\nBut then we hear the droning the endless droning\nOf the Hillary Clinton's Maxine Waters of the Chuck Schumer is of the world in Hollywood and it just is constant and what about the mobbed on the left by the way don't forget and we talked about this whole conversation yesterday regarding a the difference between nationalism white nationalism\nYou're also not allowed to talk about the mobs on the left even though we do that that is exactly what the left in ... and that's what they are promoting is go out and harassed Maxine Waters go out and harassed\nWhen you find conservatives and does it turns into this mob mentality whether we're talking about or antifa or social media mobs on Twitter we should not\nMob people\nIn public spaces for destroy public\nThere is a lot of ways subtler disagreements it's called peacefully at the ballot boxes while we were\nYeah there you go and that's what the president is trying to do and that's what I Believe it or not there's actually some people that have criticized President Trump for that comment ended up itself going to the ballot box\nSaying the way that we fight all this is going to the ballot box and some people are saying oh did you hear that he's politicizing this a really horrible situation and so I heard that\nAnd the first thing I thought of of course was a Hillary Clinton and I'm not going to play the audio don't worry but remember Hillary yesterday I talked about how we need to elect leaders that are little more unifying and all that kind of stuff and I again I Can't stand here the woman's voice that I'm not going to play\nAt today because Everytime I Do I get complaints from people and I totally get it\nI really do you know whose voice I Would rather hear the Hillary at least they're Sanders\nWhether president condemned the violence in all forms have done that since day one will continue to do that but certainly I feel that everyone has a role was absolutely\nNow listening to this Maxine Waters this is a this is a woman who I I don't know why she has become such a such a cause a lab or for the left because there are times when she just is absolutely unhinged\nAnd so she is out there now and and she's got some uh some quotes and I'm going to read some of these to you\nAnd this is being reported in the hill and this one is in fact you know [noise] it's a one page not even two or three this one page article out of the health tells you all you need to know about the ... narrative\nHeadline\nMaxine Waters responds to mailed the bombs I ain't scared okay fine\nSo what she says is that the president needs to quote take responsibility for the kind of violence that we are seeing for the first time in different ways in the wake of multiple explosive devices she says the president of the United states has been\nDog whistle into his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by quote unquote those people over there\n\nNow I'm not entirely sure who she means but she says those people over there are we talking about the caravan are we talking about\nI don't know the middle eastern folks I I don't know who she is talking about when she saw what she's saying those people over there but that's a Maxine Waters talk about that dog whistling by the way you don't think that that that dog whistle to the left\n\nThis whole notion of dog whistling I Swear to God it's getting so incredibly tiresome constantly talking about you know with the you know what it is here's what it is\nWith Maxine Waters and these more on on the left when they talked about how the the president is dog whistling whether it's him talking about how he is a nationalist or whatever\nThat gives them the excuse by saying the president is dog whistling\nThat gives them the opportunity and the excuse to say this is what he's really meaning to say this is what he really mean it's just a dog whistle and so now they're they're assigning meaning to the president's words that he never intended\nAnd they're allowed to do so\nSo Maxine Waters continued on and I think they're acting in a way that they think the president wants them to do talking about his constituency talking about a lot of folks like me and perhaps you who supported and voted for the president\nIt's all about dog whistles so what it is\nShow yeah she says that uh people are acting in a way that they think the president wants them to do and the way he wants them to act before adding that Trump in his own way really does promote a lot of violence\n\nI mean this is this is the mentality of the left now even if you are subscribing to the fact that\nThese explosives were sent by somebody who was a Trump supporter but she is trying to do is she's trying to say well all Trump supporters\nAre you know listening to this dog whistle and so this is the problem with Trump supporters is we're all engaged in violence we're all okay with these explosives these bombs being sent to the home of George Soros and block Obama and Hillary Clinton it goes on and on\nI Am a Trump supporter and if this was sent by a fellow Trump supporter I Will say that was absolutely wrong\nBut\nNobody's going to call out Maxine Waters for effectively saying yeah all from some ... isn't that what we're not supposed to do in this country by the way it say all everybody regardless of what we're talking about you can't lump a whole group of people in with the actions of just one\nAnd I believe that's true for Democrats I Believe that's true for liberals and I believe that's true for conservatives and Republicans as well\nBut listen to how this is framed because I I was talking about how this particular story is emblematic of a couple of different a battle going on here in America today so we got Maxine Waters throwing all Trump supporters and with this whole stupid dog whistling business listen to how\nThe hell frames this discussion\nEach of those targeted has been criticized repeatedly by Trump think about that\nEach of those targeted had been criticized repeatedly by Trump Hillary Clinton Brock Obama John Brennan Maxine Waters Robert De Niro\nJoe Biden are these the leaders of the resistance movement\nDidn't Robert Deniro get on stage at what was it the Tonys and say FU Trump\nHas been Hillary Clinton Ben incessantly blasting the president\nAnd his supporters at every turn

investigation coming up in fact if that were they talking right now are you on a Fox News if you could\nTell us today on CNN there on that what's that I'm watching CNN\nAlternative Fox because it looks like there is some sort of an update on the bomb investigation I don't know if this is alive or not though so that's what we're trying to figure out because there's a lot to talk about what we're trying to find out is yeah that's life obviously who sent the bomb that last part that up real quick and see if we can\nUm find out what the latest is\nIf I Can't do it right away your your why not you\nTell me about what what do you mean you can't do it right away it's on TV you pull it up\n\nOkay All right well we'll let you know at the very latest as as soon as or wherever they pick it up on the board one of the things that um the media has been saying is the fact that you have these conservatives are who are simply at one of the things I Would say is they're they're saying that these conservatives are\nOn the fringe the part of the lunatic fringe the ones that are are saying that this is some sort of a a hoax this is some sort of a a liberal hawks and what they were openly doing what they're trying to do\nIs they are dismissing some of the people like myself and others who have been saying listen there are there's plenty of questions here there's plenty of questions that you could you could ask regarding these explosives regarding these ah these bombs that have been sent\nTo all of these various uh politicians and also a members of the media you've got to Robert De Niro as well but if you have the audacity to even ask the question you are a conspiracy theorist so we're going to get into that and a whole lot more straight ahead and want to say hello to Patty in Franklin, Kentucky on WGN petty go ahead\nOh yes it's very interesting that you should mention that about the Democratic operatives because when my boys were growing up\nThe oldest one would wet the bed and he had to change it every morning and the youngest would never did so I found it in one morning and they're standing over the youngest one bad paint on his dad because he wanted him to take responsibility for something like that or to get into trouble as well\nYeah you know it's been an interesting morning a pattern I appreciate the caller's been an interesting morning an interesting couple of days\nBecause you do have both sides and they're pointing at each other and one of the things and I'm going I'm going to play some audio from a John Case it can also Sarah Huckabee Sanders because this really does seem to be a battle between the Democrats and the media\nAnd the Republicans necessarily what's been going on so this is a ... you can mix\nMy audio is up and this is Sarah Huckabee Sanders and she is talking about how listen to the American people ultimately need to know who did this\nThe president's going to continue to lay out the case and the differences between Democrats and Republicans Americans have a choice to make and he's gonna lay that out you're going to see him do that over the next ...\nYeah and and you heard right there at the end and unfortunately our our find news network didn't provide us the rest of that soundbite but one of the things that you heard the reporter saying there and we didn't get the full question what is he going to stop and I'm going to assume\nThat the question from the reporter was is he going to stop calling for tax on the media right 'cause this is what this is all about\nThat is what the narrative on the left is and so here's what a Sarah Sanders said about that about the media and the fact that they just love to play the victim\nLet's continue to focus only on the negative and here there is a hold of like yesterday the very first thing that the president did would come out and condemned the violence [laughter] very first thing you're networked did come out and accused the president of being responsible for them that is not okay the first things that have been condemned the violence\nAnd it is interesting when you when you listen to these questions by the way she could also here at the media just I mean everybody is\nIs asking her questions second onslaught of questions and so this is west a audio piece from a Sarah Sanders and she does bring up a great point which is something a lot of folks are talking about because remember he got Maxine Waters and ah the people on the left who are saying that even if this is a Trump supporter\nIt's indicative of all Trump supporters and their report behavior and Sarah Sanders brings us up\nThe president is certainly not responsible for sending suspicious packages to someone no more than Bernie Sanders was responsible for a supporter of his shooting up or Republican they fulfill practice last year the idea that this is at the hands of the presidents and\nYeah and and she brings up a great point but one of the things you gotta realize too is a lot of this is so I'm based in in political correctness\nAnd that's part of the conversation here as well because of the fact that if you are not just automatically screaming about how this is all about Donald Trump and this is all about his abusive nature against the media and and Democrats and so on\nIt if you're somebody who's not willing to call it Donald Trump than you are on the wrong side of\nPolitical correctness in John Case it can we know all about John tastes like this is a guy who was dispatched in pretty uh like I said pretty quick order because he was one of the last Republican standing in the primary but uh you know the he'll always take advantage of an opportunity to bash the president and here's what he had to say\nWe're now have a heightened sense of of of of threats and panic and ... they're going to be in your home at all this stuff and you know people are and what happens somebody out there who's\nWho's unstable does something crazy\nYeah so one of the things you've got to realize is this is going to be an opportunity for anybody who hates President Trump to get their shot and now the president I play the audio earlier this hour the president is out there saying look I'm trying to be nice and he's been calling for unity as he has been for a long time now\n\nIt's not surprising that now the president's critics are asking are saying that this is a simply a hollow up please from the president to call for unity that the president last night said listen we could do this we can all be unified we seriously can", "show_name": "Dan Mandis", "year":
