about my life\nBut of all the things you know about me\nHere's one you down a\nI'm One of every six Americans and I'm struggling with hunger\nThis isn't an incurable disease or it's not an uncontrollable epidemic\nThere's enough food in this country\nTo feed every hungry person\nThis problem it's closer than you think fortunately so if you\nHad yours in vale Nashville\nSee we were taught I mean I [noise]\nIs through a process called in the mission and basically what that is is when you move your vertebrae your disc as like a sponge and it's like if it's like if you took a sponge and you put it in a bucket of water you pump that sponge a little bit to get the water in the ... your disc for the same way\nIn order for them to get water in them to to re hydrate and get your minerals inside of your disc you have to actually move your bones to pump your desk so the purpose of the desk is to supply um basically flexible shock absorption two year low back to the purpose ever discussed flexible shock absorbed into your low back\nThe problem with your desk 'cause it's not designed to hold you in a shearing force it doesn't and so when you're when you're sort of are sharing next to each other it's not supposed to do that so\nMost disc injuries are a sharing type of an injury so what does that mean specifically for you it's very simple so we've got so you get your five or the bra and above and below the vertebrae have disks well what you have front to back because you actually have seven thick ligaments that hold your spine from front to back\nAnd it's these these front to back ligaments they're like basically like seven pieces that duct tape the duct tape this whole piece together so that when you bend and twist and stretch it it's all move normally the problem is is that when you have an injury\nI'm specifically this can be\nA you know been over to pick something weird I'm your whiplash most people by the way it's a whiplash or you think of whiplash and your neck but but really whiplash is just common in the low back maybe even more common\nI'm used to be a little bit more common when he just had the lap belt you see people with major whiplash lumbar spine because they'd have a car accident with just the last ... not the shorter hardest but now she more with Washington next\nIt was regardless now we're gonna see whip washing low back that's anytime you fall down slip and fall on the ice group that's with last year low back anytime that you are played football tackle boom whiplash too low back any sound that you get a bit over to pick something up super heavier to strain those ligaments\nSo what happens when he restrain ligaments in our back we stretch military him now are ligaments cannot supply the needed\nA reinforcement for the shearing force and guess what takes that brought the disc does the disc does in your lumbar spawn\nWhen you're just doesn't do that ... that cheering force now we start to lose the curve and are low back in every time we walk west you wind up putting a strain on our lumbar disk\nOf course is easier to show you what the picture but we're talking on radio and I we have the radio so I'm trying to explain to you so what is the fix here for for low back issues as well as you can imagine basically what we've done is we've torn ligament for some sort of a lumbar injury\nWe've turned toward the front to back ligaments and now we have instability in our desk\nAnd way of instability of our disc now we're going to have those ... that was called the nucleus and the report that part of the disc tries to rip those inhaler fibers risk rip those disc fibers that can put pressure on your nerves cause all kinds of issues cause you're back to lock up so the big question here the the twenty million dollar question is what do you do to fix it\nBecause here's what doesn't work\nIf you have a torn ligament and all you do is take pain medication right so we take ibuprofen your back hurts take ibuprofen\nWhat's that going to do is going to make you not feel the pain so what you're going to do is going to wind up walking around in read damaging maybe even extra damaging the the the disks in your back because you're not feeling the pain there's nothing in your body to stop you\nFrom abnormally moving your body if that makes sense\nSo that's obviously going to be a just a terrible idea is to take pain medication I sold me ask you about this with surgery what do they do a surgery as well as surgery that goes through and they wind up cleaning up the desk so if you ever heard of ... which by the way we talk about how you're just can heal itself in a second\nUm but if you're just has a hernia operation then the surge is going to go through and tried to trim off those ... well that doesn't fix the problem because again the problem is you have instability of the ligaments of your lumbar spine so what do we do here first and foremost\nIs we have to re approximate the bone so generally speaking when you stretch and tear ligament in your back the bones have basically become separated it stretches ligaments so the first thing we do do do we need to move the bones closer to each other so that way the ligaments glue themselves back together\nWell how do you do that well it's real simple a chiropractic adjustment some people to convert to Dutch so dumb or don't believe in our project this some sort of a witchcraft well actually the opposite of witchcraft\nIs actually a matter of fact the most common sense that you could possibly do if you move a vertebrate out a position in your back though to move back in the right position yes and not only that but don't you need to be able to have an X ray or something to tell you is the boat in the wrong position and if I moved it is it in the right position\nAnd would it be great if you could just shoot an X ray you're back to see if there's a stability issue in the ligaments in your back\nBefore you started so that is what I Do that is why I'm actually a part of a group of ... national they have some of the largest car practical officers in the world because we have specific corrective techniques that specifically deal with making sure to re stabilize ligaments out\nNext I mean I'm Talking about arthritis and talk about a little bit more of the rehab of the muscles cause that's something that we also do but\nIf I'm immediately got your attention maybe got somewhere to be right now you can't listen to the show any more I Want to give you an offer\nHow would you the radio shows every every

Sandy brought her and we shot a set of X rays VIP there's problem right there\nEr which by the way is not to do is to get a vote he has to do with the injuries that you've had\nA a dumb you by the way she was convinced she had to sway back and she didn't she actually just had tore ligaments in her lumbar spawn and which by the what do you think toward leniency walking around a wheel you'll see in a wheelchair crush it that's not how it works when you stretch into her ligaments\nNow your muscles have to come in and re stabilized causes a lot of basically low back pain do ag pain you know at the end of the day you're ... feel tired and worn out and after a while it winds up being that sharp stabbing kind of pain that's where it that's the point that she was asked we shot her X rays ligament stretching torn low back we could see a very ... very clearly in the X rays\nAnd do what we could see the position of the vertebrae which indicates that the ... the the L ligaments have been stretching torn and we did adjustment\nAnd what that does re approximate those vertebrae now Cindy story was one that is kind of typical on you hear me telling me about your stories because if people to get adjusted one time and poof it's all gone well Cindy story was not that story she had to rehab Rebecca took a few weeks before she was able to feel massive relief and the reason is because\nHer her um muscles down there had been doing so much work for so long there's so much\nScar tissue and and ... those muscles that we had to break up and had a short some exercises and they had to just heal up right of course we adjusted her we work through that but she's somebody who had back pain you're kind of stabbing back pain for probably Fifteen or Twenty years and within about thirty days it

slide the number one reason people to have low back pain is because we've had these old injuries where we wind up stretching and tearing the ligaments in her lumbar spine\nAnd by the way this famous trip for your neck\nWas neck painted headaches and and I'm paying down to in your arms shoulders and hands\nBut we wanted stretching turning these ligaments and what that causes instability when you're ... in stable that's going to or unstable it's going to cause your disc to ... to basically the the nucleus to ... to strip through that disk and that causes ... all kinds of bad stuff\nBut what it also causes your muscles to have to fire I'm inspires them to stabilize those forever because the the latest can't do it so that the muscles have to do it and that causes your ... or an ATM

your genetics or what your dad look like your grandpa looked like it only has to do with your specific injuries\nNow and that's what causes arthritis right are you seeing how this all works\nAnd then

designed to heal and if it's made in the image of the above guys listen I Am Dr been it's been an awesome Eris you all this health is out of the radio catch it actually [noise]\nWhen you\nHave your same veil Nashville\nYou were talking about I mean I [noise]\nKevin on the court meeting with North Korea I man came by Kevin begins his first day tomorrow is a U.S Supreme Court justice that's after bruising confirmation fight Ohio governor John K to CNN's State of the union that the country must move on it's\nAnd you have zero these cars your your employers that a good thing it gives you the best plan\nAnd what's assume you both have the same investment options which is not true but let's just assume that okay and you're both averaging six percent return\nOver Thirty years which is a reasonable return we're not seeing twelve or Eighteen or ten percent six will just like there'll be up and down years in the four one K. literally you average six percent yeah so your account with zero fees at the end of Thirty years you started with let's say you had two hundred thousand dollars you started with no roads ... four one K. and your plan you left it alone you never attitude again\nJust pretending you didn't put money in which is not good but let's just pretend\nMr Rogers did a good job of that list tribe Mr Rogers that'd be done\nAt the end of Thirty years you would have one point one for eight million so one one million one hundred forty thousand dollars in your account ... growing it six percent because you had no face now your neighbor who had those three percent feeds coming out each and every year and fees compound because you have the money you don't have is not there anymore to build\nHe started with two hundred thousand just like you to grow at six percent at the end of Thirty years he had four hundred eighty four thousand oh my God\nSo for yes so over the past is not there anymore so where to go for every action is equal opposite reaction All right so just because the money's not there and your accounts and somebody else is the gas missing that money is not there for you who deserves the most important person in your retirement when\nYou eat out all of that individual retirement plan a lot of times when you roll your money from a four one K. into an IRA individual retirement a gal\nYour ... is a group of ... so you're in there with everybody else they're all being feed to death many times and so the the beauty is if you want to have a ... you can roll your money if you're fifty nine and a half into your own individual camp and you can continue to put money into your four one K.\nSo you had the best of both worlds you can get an income plan with your individual camp and you can continue to put money into four one K. now if you're getting feed to death that might not make sense to put any money in their ... wish you could imagine even that is debatable whether\nWhether you break even and other than that right so there's so much confusion out there I'm going to talk more about this four one K. the invention of it in forty years I mean it's a great anniversary now because a lot of people have sexual retirements\nBecause they put money in their four one K. we'll talk about that later on the show\nSo Steve I I Want to do this because I think people need help and ... you're Nineteen Steve you're like you're ... anyone between these ages and even above and different parameters can qualify for this but if you have at least two hundred thousand safe retirement will help you because will fall a three step process for you to create a comprehensive financial plan\nThat alliance with your financial goals and your values that first we're going to understand what money means to you and your family and how it fits into your life not our life but your life you're the most important people out there is your plan\nThen will organize your finances so you have a clear picture of where you currently stand right now that's the biggest mistake I see out there is people don't know where they are\nThey don't know what kind of fees they have been uh what kind of balance they need they don't know if they can retire today tomorrow or a decade later because they they don't have a plan Steve so let's get a plan put together next we're going to talk about your financial goals what are your short medium and long term goals for your retirement for your money what do you want to do the next twenty thirty fifty years of your life\nAnd what are your dreams more importantly what are you really want to do and we work together to clarify your goals who they are crystal clear and tangible in other words there possible we'll make sure that they if you want to do something and you have it on your mind will give you an honest answer if you can do it or not and if not we'll get you on track so you can\nNow find we were created an action will step process to get you on the path towards what's the most important term in this whole world financial independence\nI think it'll be every ... whenever I see I like that [laughter] so what's at liberty retirement right here so the process is not something we do want to set aside on the book shelf it's like a physical fitness in your financial fitness it needs constant attention throughout your career and beyond\nBut don't worry we'll be there every step of the way to guide you and make your money work as hard as you work to build it and our strategies do work best for those people over a million save for retirement but as long as you have two hundred thousand dedicated to retirement we can get you on that plan on the steps that you need one of the next twenty callers let's say\nYou know the first step really is to sit down with the financial coach is something that we are talking about on the show today resonates with you and you feel the need to just get that second opinion\nOr if you want to make sure your plan really is a line with your goals and that very important risk tolerance that we talk about just call in and Tom ... Scott old in the ... associates can translate for you that complex financial world into very clear instructions to take advantage of this true\nPractical retirement review all you have to do with ... at\nEight hundred six six to sixty eight oh eight eight hundred six six to six eight zero eight\nAnd you will receive a comprehensive retirement review that'll show you where you are now but much more importantly a road map to get you where you need to be that number one's\nGetting folks eight hundred six six to sixty eight eight eight hundred six six to six eight\nZero eight and when we come back we're going to talk about each T. S. coach he's got to tell us what they are and how they can help in your retirement and five financial freedoms you can't afford to surrender where we will also revisited\nThe anniversary of the four oh one K. that more when the four oh one K. she'll continue to whatever [noise]\nWe see it on the news every night many financial experts or a dream that the markets are overdue for a quote on quote friction now when we hear the word correction it sounds pretty harmless doesn't it well to be honest it's about it's harmless his when geologists say that an area\nIt's overdue for a while I mean those quote began seismic shift\nNow in plain English that means earthquake and that correction that the markets are overdue for well no one actually knows what that means that until it happens that is why whether you're retired approaching retirement or pushes the real maybe haven't even thought about it now the time to get protection from that market volatility\nCalled Tom ... got older and managing partners that Dina can associates probably serving in Nashville community eight hundred\nSix six to sixty eight eight eight hundred six six to six eight zero eight [noise]\nTwenty fourteen a A R B survey found that those are the majority\nPercent of Americans over fifty hadn't set aside money for their out of pocket medical expenses\nMore than half are worried about their ability to afford healthcare\nBecause health care will very likely being hunted significant part of your expenditures one retired research doesn't Medicare covers only about ... percent and health care costs\nThose over sixty five one study found that it took me five year old ... wouldn't need an average ... hundred twenty thousand you have a total health care spending in retirement\nAnother report put that number is high and three hundred and sixty\nThousand [noise] not your entire early may spend even more on health care because they are eligible for Medicare a couple of retiring and think needs to be adding an additional Nineteen thousand to their annual budget in insurance and other expenses\nEveryone ... needs are different which is why it's important to consider how to act like your age how family medical history in fact you're potentially\nFortunately there are strategies that you can you help pain health care and retirement determine whether you're eligible for any employer sponsored health care benefits one you retire any assistance he received Henry you're out of pocket costs and the amount you need a name for medical expense\nAnd health care plan account like a retiree health meaning plan may be available free your employer and can help provided advantaged away his name for future health care\nFinancial professional can help you determine whether this option is available to you and show you how it may fed into your overall retirement strategies [noise]\n\nAnd we are back out and you say ... of course with the is a coach feet the router and Abby Turner and the tea money Thomas Lipscomb on America's four one K. show and you know coach I was I Do a lot of research to try to put these shows together and work with a lot of other\nPlanets easy as it does it every single week for the gallery rare I mean I must have a ... thing I\nWas in the weather is I Want to do I go to Newsmax finance and what comes up coach beat the yard so that's a whole story or that you would supplied to a news max finance and it's about three retirement landmines to guarantee your four one K. survival that sounds like something we should all take a look\nI'm going to do as a financial minesweeper here to make my head oh well I used to love that yeah we have the sonar we watch the old war movies the guise of being the summary and they would have to listen to the sooner and see the thing back then it would I Want to have things in our financial ...\n...

to hang out with coach\nAnd a seed money Thomas Lipscomb and orange or Abbey Turner now we are going to talk about right now it's something that ah you know we talked about this and I scan a lot of

the article came out it looked like I had written a because every answer I gave him was in there\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThey're like oh that's pretty yeah\nIt's fun it's fun to when I went on sports radio the other day to talk to the listeners on the sports radio slight oh I heard and we talked about financial final four and basically I carry that segment to ask what have you on to talk about the financial world it's also fun did if you are listening to a person who's talking about it that they know what they're talking about ...\nYou know do you ever have ever think everyone had that friend before Google was out that they say something they act like it was the truth and you had no way of\nKilling them on it and find they if they were telling the truth [laughter] and that would actually say something about Google say I beg to differ Thomas's\n[laughter] when I returned to looking at me you are [laughter]\nWell you know when I went on a cruise or a couple of years ago when you're out in that city and I wasn't gonna pay for the plan out there 'cause they want like a dollar a minute or something if you're on the Internet and they talk about I guess yeah they got you out at sea right they're making you want to point on the Internet so I basically phone into and I made my daughter and wife do it to put their phones into the safe in the room\nLock it up and not see it for you of per week yeah problem is\nWhen he would that's what it seemed like it better [laughter] um is whenever anyone out there around the crews are saying something you can't you can't busted my if there was no you're wrong so you basically just don't listen to anybody that whole time but\nI wasn't really born or from busting indicate our our our generation with Simon Says and now it's ... yeah [laughter] that's a good one [laughter] and now let's\nGet to the article I was gonna Sharif there's three things that are killing people's retirement that's the basic theme of their ... and they could blow up your retirement\nBefore you even get there while you're there Steve in his writings that people may they're blind spots in a way and you look up the series yeah some of the book said it's it's a buck said it's called the seven financial blind spots were going to give some of those way later on but let's talk about a number one on the number\nOne on the list is really taxes you're coming up on tax season but taxes or something you need to be concerned about all your wall\nAlways a fun time now but Texas you know we get mad we pay taxes on April fifteenth or food postpone and paid waiter or whatever we're always mad 'cause you're always pay a tax write off and you pay taxes sales tax on so many taxes out their\nAutomobile tax you bike or real estate taxes gas [laughter] so they're all over the place but the biggest tax there were ever going to face the one that's not enough people get mad about or realize is the tax on your retirement account\nRight what do I mean by that well a four O. one K. yeah so if let's say you have let's say you're lucky enough to build up a million dollar value or ballots in four one K. do you really do you really have a million dollars you don't know because I mean you're basically you have to look at the balance\nAnd think about the the the the amount that's going to come out the good Uncle Sam you're never going to see if you have a hundred million that's two million short on most people don't have a million but it was just do a million are these into a whole number if you have a million in your four one K. plant or any kind of tax deferred retirement plan\nWhen you really look at the balance you should be putting down seven hundred thousand or so as far as money you built up not a million okay in order to have a million you probably need one point four million in your accounts they have a million after tax wild and that's when taxes really started to her you know we hear about it when someone wins the lottery\nAnd we laugh about it we say gosh if it was me I Would do this or who cares or they have to pay taxes still have a lot of money a guy wins four hundred million dollars you hear about they had to pay two hundred million attacks\n[laughter] oh my God I wanted to do that that's a good old man would\nGo a silver we see this every day when people come in they're getting close to retirement we see this when I asked him I said well you know how much Jeff save for retirement and they'll say well they'll say they're total balance into four one K. and I'll say well you know that's not really what you have\nAnd they'll say what do you mean that's the number one the money that you have in there you're gonna have to share with local Sam\nAnd number two most where one case I really haven't seen one yet that that has one but most for one case don't have an income plan so they'll say here's your lump sum and lump sum are fun when they're big but they're not funded\nAfter you take the first patrol out of it yeah I mean you don't have a when you don't have any money getting replaced and then let's say you keep it in risk in the market goes down and you're taking money out that's a double whammy you think that could ever happens to of course that could happen and yes I Lived through it several yeah yeah so we're all worried about the market crashing our accounts but we could be the ones to crash or retirement 'cause we start needed money to live on right\nYeah it's true well there's that expression others too much month at the end of the money you've heard that or what if that were there's too much retirement at the end of the money oh my goodness I haven't even imagined do\nMost families have one percent of the two that's very worried about the money the other one spend it all over the place that we're talking with go after them there's a lot of a divorce was because of that there's a lot of emotional and satisfaction and people aren't happy with what's going on retirement supposed to be happy time that's right you're Nineteen what are you there is a retirement being\nI'm traveling every way beyond fun money gonna spoiling grandchildren down yes yes what else um what about you you can spoil yourself to try out getting close\nTo the camera equipment that I Want to say yeah I knew the cash registers downtime asserting that much [laughter] I'm just their money might or might [laughter]\nAnd that's how much do you want to travel around the money it does still costs money and then where you go wherever wherever you go to spend money they're gonna have to access to sail unless you go to Florida but I mean you know that's that's one place to a lot of overseas countries it's even more you know and they don't change where you have to worry about that kind of things\nI think it just how much flights of increased over the last ten Twenty years let alone you know by the time I hit retirement\nSo what can people do about the scene I'm sitting here moaning about it well there's one thing we can do is we can allocate our money correctly not have it all growing tax deferred pay some tax on some of the ... tax free yeah for the future and get some money growing for an income that you never have to worry about living so then you have streams of income coming in and that's what we call\nAt\nNight accounts swan accounts you sleep well at night knowing that you have somebody that's going to show up every single year for the rest of your life\nCall that a financial fill up and Steve we talked about over and over again a lot of people want to hear about this because well I knew that my girlfriend and in college she her mom had a Jay Giedd you are [laughter] jaguar model I Would say that you are that they had to guess taken in her car\nSo if one ran out the other one was there a really a lot of the great up to an income checks come ... already so you have two different income strange where you can build your own income plants where you are I saw some people the other day\nTwelve different income stream said oh no that's a little bit much but hey that whatever floats your boat whatever makes them happy there you guys they didn't have to turn the income streams on until they wanted them to turn them on a different times that's called income planning their Israel or if you have that's yeah and so taxes for them was not the best thing because they're going to have a lot of income coming in but to me\nIf I could have the choice of having a whole lot of income coming in and yeah having to pay a little bit more taxes as opposed to not having much income and not have much taxes between thing I'm going to say well I'll tell you I got to every single time yeah yeah so\nThat's the way we do our plans we try to maximize income and minimize risk\nWhich in effect will minimize worried going forward that's the most important part that is what retirement income planting really is and that's what wealth management is so if you're one of the next Fifteen people who call right now we're going to put together for you an easy to understand funniest review this review indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial planner not\nOf having a currency that's backed by something I'd is it's not backed by a guy so I haven't put any money and I did talk to somebody who bought some and then he couldn't figure how to sell it sort of like those real estate investment try ...\nRid of it yeah I Love that code that getting into the ...\nOr the individual what what are they doing what they're they've created their own currency everyone's gonna have their own currency now\nSpeaker at best is it going [laughter] I have\nSeen a couple of places when you go to order it it says it will like I I bought a silver bar the other day a hundred ounces of going to have it on my desk in my office on a bar\nAnd they would take credit card but for Seventy dollars cheaper they would have taken bitcoin wow I don't know how to win so I don't want to do that so anyway it's it's funny it is being accepted as currency but I'm fifty two Steve you're sixty\nAnd a half you're Nineteen and Thomas you're thirty something years I guess you guys younger maybe understand that but me and Steve what brought up on the gold standard for every dollar their side of it and how they could just create it yet really even\nSomeone my age being having seen the Internet launched almost in my generation and makes me almost a little nervous until it's been out a couple more years or or give it a little bit more time a little bit more aware you know what I mean no don't\n[laughter]\nThere is something that's coming good out of these a bitcoin thanks it's called block chain technology and it's a verification process oh which is very very much better than anything we have out there today so we'll hear a lot going forward and twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nAbout block chain technology you hear that that's a big a buzz word and then in that combine that with artificial intelligence ... which was like me and high school and like I was smart\n[laughter] no\nBut it's it is I mean who knows but see so the choices in your four one K. don't put all your eggs in one basket if you're young you should take higher risk\nThere's all kinds of shorts Russia as we get older though we should we should we should take that risk down but how much should we came down shall we go into target date fund I'm not a big believer in target date funds yeah I'd rather be an ... again ... index account and that's a P index in my four one K.\n'cause I I think I have a lot better chance of learning some money plus\nFive hundred companies have to do bad for me not to do good so do I want to do that it's not going into the war and you do these target funds like twenty twenty or twenty thirty forty\nYou're almost assuring you're not going to much money I don't like insuring I'm not going to ... I Want to ensure I'm not going to lose much money I don't want to ensure I'm not going to make much money you know that's a mistake people make when you get into target date fund and they put way too much of their money in there\nAnd the four oh one K. versus the Roth IRA and not yet and the four o one K Ross\nThomas there's a lot of people out there were four one K. C. if they did and they don't really know where they should put their money if you win in this takes us time to do but we'll sit down to a full analysis for you about your four one K. your your options we should be where you want to be as far as yourself in the future we should be inside those options in percentage wise\nFor the next twenty people will do that at no cost her application that's usually a five hundred dollar consultation 'cause the last three steps\nSo ... and again one of the things that are that we are talking about is a former one case and I and I just touched on a briefly was the the Ross IRA or the raw four one K. yeah both of those are really good options especially you know depending on your situation but it seems the younger you are the more sense of ...\nI agree and by the number three thing on this list that we're talking about is getting help getting help and ... this one thing to do it yourself that's great to be proud of yourself and all that but I've heard the saying for years I think I was in high school when I heard at first but and it was about the attorney down the street my mom would say to my dad\nYou know what they say Joey and I was you know Brazil is if we want to listen to but I still did 'cause I reckon resigned today fifty years later she said and attorneys worth going isn't self [laughter]\nYou know when you look at the landscape or in the neighborhood usually they have the worst yard ... doing we need to make sure we get the proper help on our side and and I want to make sure before we leave for the week that I give

kids are coming to the forest and it's up to us to make a visit a good one sparrow yeah have you practice the most popular bird songs for the year\nRead the label and if the label says vitamin C. and then in parentheses that'll say us or be gas it\nWell you got a ... a gas that you don't have vitamin C. uh now it's called vitamin C. the FDA allows it to be called vitamin C is the active component of vitamin C. but vitamin C in and of itself is a complex\nIt has a different coal factors that has a score but gas it it has copper in there so it's a complex and if you ever look at vitamin C. under a microscope it looks like a rainbow I mean it's full of life real vitamin C. you look at a score but gas it under a microscope and\nDone this uh it's black and white and there's not a lot of life left in their matter of fact if you take a vitamin C a known as a score but gas it for any length of time or it will eventually burn up your adrenal glands now your adrenal gland sit on top of your kidneys their\nTheir what's called the stress glance or that kind of like the carburetor they got to keep everything going\nSo uh the overtime they will burn up your uh adrenal glands so what I recommend and some people like to take their vitamin C. or are there are scored the gas effects should say and I do recommend it but on short term basis not long term basis\nFor instance somebody's going to do some traveling they're going to go maybe out of the United states or they're going from one side of the United states to the other side I'm they could take some vitamin C. they might want to load up on a scored the gas it before they start\nYou can use it as a catalyst to get things moving and moving fast in the body\nAnd they'll take it while they're gone they're gone for a week or three or four days and they can take their vitamin C. and then they might want to take a four day or two when they get home and then you stop you give your body or break on that\nUh we use it as a catalyst to move things a faster in the body so we're always using it as a short term solution not a long term solution\nAnd it will help in certain situations but Ninety nine point nine percent of what I Do is whole food\nSo we don't really have to use that a lot of times\nUh depends on the individual and we do have real vitamin C. and my office it's called ... the ... means complete everything you need to absorb vitamin C is in that a tablet and complete meaning that it's a complete vitamin C just like you'd find in an orange\nUm so uh we deal with whole foods at my office and that's how we get people well\nUh we get 'em well by finding out first of all what is going on with them what what's the weakest area of their body obviously that's a good good place to start\nThere's this whole system I'm finding out what the weakest Glenn Oregon is in your body and then uh then we are going to strengthen it how do we strengthen up while we strengthen with real food whole food and we want to get that good strong now I get many people in that want to\nHandle their thyroid let's say and what will happen is they'll come in they'll beyond thyroid medication and again we want to look at that as a short term solution not a long term solution\nOr and then their bodies happy with the medication so we have to handle the adrenal glands first or maybe the liver first so we'll find out what the body wants to handle there's a whole system on figuring that out\nAnd then we handled that usually takes about four maybe six weeks to get to a good stable point now that doesn't mean everything is perfect but\nWe got a good stable point with nutrition a nutrition working the Glenn in Oregon a is working better it's it's getting stronger and then maybe we would be able to handle the thyroid but if we jump in there and somebody comes in I got direct problem\nAnd we just start jumping in on the thyroid without really knowing what the uh sequences where do we really start a than we can run into problems and we can never ever get that person well\nSo we do everything on gradients at my office that's the way the body heal body wants to heal the weakest area\nBecause if we don't heal that first uh we'll never get that person uh well so when somebody comes to my office uh we're taking a nutritional approach a natural approach or if they're on medication that's perfectly fine I have no problem with medication or my only problem is that it's used as a long term solution not a short term solution\nUh my other problem is that uh with medication is that it's overprescribed everything has everything needs medication well that's not true neither\nThere's many many things that will respond to a nutrition and we're going to be talking one of our subjects here will be a diabetes or high blood sugar and we'll talk about that and how we handle that in my office\nUh but um it can be handled with nutrition now if somebody comes in and they have diabetes or high blood sugar and its uncontrolled I might even refer 'em out to get them on some medication Tobias some time so that we can figure this out\nAnd get it under control so I have nothing against medication\nExcept uh being over utilized for a lot of uh problems that really need nutrition but it does biased time and that's the way we should look at it as a short term solution not a long term solution [noise] All right we're going to take a short break we'll be back uh we'll\nGo to the next step up how do we get you well how do we do that naturally after the break\nRight like a girl is a nonpartisan hot cat it's a

hundred percent whole nutrition uh\nAnd we do several things are first phase is to get that Glenn whatever it is the weakest clan of the body good strong if we don't get that Glenn Gould and strong and guess what the person doesn't get well\nAnd if they don't get well then uh I haven't done my job you got to find the weakest area of the body and you got to handle that first like I was saying earlier the person might come in with a thyroid issue but we might have to handle their adrenal first\nAnd once we get the adrenal handled then we can go to the thyroid or there's a certain gradient that the body wants to handle\nMost Americans are walking around with what we call a congested liver it's filling up with floods is working overtime\nSo we have to go in and we have to clean that up we got to get those pathways open so that we can um actually get rid of what our next step would be which is on a cellular level to start getting rid of toxins\nToxins or could be anything from heavy

in a\nIn elementary school the food pyramid if you look at the bottom of the food pyramid it says nine to eight grams servings of of Ninety eight servings of carbohydrates per day\nWhile I guarantee you if you eat nine to eight servings of carbohydrates which is basically another way of saying sugar per day um you'll be a diabetic\nYes and that's what's happening with a lot of people that are food pyramid was just made up and put together and sold to the government uh there's no science behind it if you've noticed over the past several years\nThat um that they tried to Dyson slice it and do everything to make it work it doesn't work it's not based on true facts\nEight to nine servings of grains per day will definitely turn you in to a diabetic matter of fact there's twenty nine
