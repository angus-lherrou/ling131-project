Democrats including Jeff Flake this whole thing is laughable ... this is clearly a political because there's so many holes in her story\nThat just has to be political or you're just certified was stupid\nThat that's the other thing you could say because of the fact that this is something that happened supposedly over Thirty years ago she doesn't mentioned it to anybody suddenly comes up in therapy but she doesn't mention him by name again all of the holes in the story\nYou are either certified stupid in the sense that you're not able to\nTo comprehend that her ... her story is so full of holes or you're incredibly political it's got to be one of those two\nWas this or a criminal case I'm telling you I Would definitely have to go and get a subpoena to check her bank records to see friday there's many any kind of pay off not only hers but her husband's\nYeah at I mean this is all I Would think anyway fairly obvious one of the things that a lot of people are talking about is oh so what you're saying is that there's some sort of a some sort of a conspiracy to argue with somebody in the hallway today\nHighly inappropriate conversation for ... for a hallway conversation at work and sadly I got dragged into it and that will never happen again\nBut you know you've got some of these folks on the left that are talking about how oh so this is some sort of conspiracy to know\nA conspiracy is some sort of a a theory this is not a conspiracy this is the fact\nThis is the fact that the left is using Ford and they're using\nWhatever hashtags me to wave that they can to bludgeon as I've been calling it but they they use this bludgeon of political correctness and this this culture of of men are evil and men are bad and men are trash to absolutely destroyed this guy and we know that this is true\nSo yeah again either you're just simply not willing or able to comprehend this woman story\nOr you are extraordinarily political now ability to grab some of these phone calls it got a whole bunch of calls coming in but ah one of the things that happened over the weekend was a Jeff Flake he appeared on TV I think it was sixty minutes\nAnd Scott Kelly was the host and uh he appeared with Coontz says Senator Cruz the Democrats\nAnd so they had this big long conversation\nAbout how difficult of a process this process this was a to get this one week delay now one of the things that you have to realize\nIs that Jeff Flake and I and I said this on Twitter I if it has to have weak minded for because clearly what's happening\nIs that he is being portrayed as a hero Jeff Flake is\nAnd the reason why he's being portrayed as a hero is because just like Christine forward flake is being used by the left so he's being put up on some sort of a a hero hash tag me to you know whatever\nA supporter because of what he did which is ultimately force the Republicans in the FBI to postpone this the confirmation vote for another week so that they can have the FBI specification\nAnd so the more the he's treated a hero by the media and also by the Democrats and by the liberals\nThen there's absolutely no way that he is going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh because he is now flake after you know a couple of years of being beaten up by Republicans and Donald Trump and that's what this is all about by the way we all know that this is what it's all about is this is one final middle finger to Donald Trump\nSo flaky never really had a home\nWithin the Republican Party because of the fact that he was so anti Trump especially lately with the economy doing so well so what does he do he jumps in bed with the Democrats and and so in this story\nIn this big long interview with Coontz he talks about how quote unquote our country is at being ripped apart and so here's part of that conversation but one of the things that you got to realize is during this whole entire\nThirteen fourteen minutes piece not one time did they call into question the credibility of Christine forward only the credibility of Brett Kavanaugh listen\nI don't think anybody expected him to um\nYou know what happened on friday to happen and ah [noise] I Can't tell you that I could either or just knew that\nWe couldn't move forward that I couldn't move forward without hitting the pause button [noise] um because of what to say experiencing than elevator and watching it in committee and just thinking this is rep in our country as far as well of\nCourse it's ripping this country apart the reason why it's ripping this country part is because of the fact that the Democrats are are making a a political assassination out of this Supreme Court nomination there they're destroying this man's character again\nWe're talking about um accusations that have zero credibility and by the way he also says it well all of this is going on and he's getting input from outside the committee listen to this\nI'm hearing I'm a a very smart I'm anguished person who did not want to be testifying in front of us and meanwhile my phone is just blowing up it is stunning the number of people I heard from during the herring\nOr that that it was it was almost hard to know which to listen to more because the things coming in were so striking and they were saying what\nAre you telling me very long time and I was raped as a child and I've never told anyone before right now and I'm sharing it with you\nSo I Want to make sure you heard that so what he includes are saying is that they didn't know what they should listen to the hearing the testimony in front of them or the input coming in on their cell phones\nOf people they've known for a long time talking about how they were sexually assaulted and they were raped and by the way you know where again in this big long piece was there any conversation about this this hallway of verbal attack\nThat in the elevator that Jeff Flake went through and Ava played a piece of the audio of this woman screaming at Jeff Flake about how she herself was assaulted again they even used the audio by where she says to flake\nYou are actually putting someone on the Supreme Court who actually did this\nAnd this news program that has a a very long and rich history of journalism failed to mention that these are clearly allegations\nAnd not calling into question the fact that this woman and and this audio that went viral and this video that went viral of flake or in this elevator cowering eye to this woman who by the way more on her but she has ties to George Soros big surprise I called that on a Thursday and friday\nBucks says that on the next trip North Carolina you get this car stolen\nYou know into what drives me under oath I yeah I I I put money on that\nNow nine to twelve thirty I'm super talking to nine seven WGN didn't

continues in Montgomery County the FBI TV I and local law enforcement all looking for Kirby Wallace who's been on the run since last week in the gallery county sheriff a short time ago tells one happened this morning we\nReceived the call or nine one one dispatchers received a call at about nine twenty four that come from residents Wilker road which is in Montgomery County community would long community or the caller was a a juvenile\nAnd\nThey were concerned because they see someone walking around the residents in camouflage pants and the camouflage shirt a and had a pistol\nI'm at about nine\nTwenty five a gun shots were heard it was communicated to the dispatchers\nSo yeah there's a little bit of a credibility issue there's\nClearly a sixty minutes decided not to cover she also is confused as to how old she was at the time 'cause during one interview she was apparently in her late teens but in another interview she was a Fifteen Years old\nSo again we're talking about years off\nWe also know that Dr Ford has struggled to identify cabin out by a name as her assailant\nSo there is just hold after whole after a hole in her story that are Rachel Michel talked about now we know is that I was going through my show prep over the last ah forty eight hours\nThat the woman who cornered a Jeff Flake and its elevator which by the way I'm starting to wonder if that whole thing was set set up\nBecause you get all these protesters that are just roaming around the ... the hallways and so somehow these these Soros backed women who who who swear that they've been assaulted in the past\nThey swear that this happened to them\nA couple of things on this one of them is okay so I Would say to the women who are screaming at Jeff Flake and and who are backed by George Soros if that happened to you well then that's that's horrible and and I'm Sorry for that but why don't you take that up with your accuser\nAs opposed to taking it up with say for example Jeff Flake or Brett Kavanaugh\nSee I I feel like part of what's happening with all of this is that we have a situation in America\nWhere we have a lot of these women who may very well have been either raped or assaulted in the past and they're trying to they're trying to blame men today\nAnd specifically Brett Kavanaugh they're taking out all their pent up anger and resentment against judge Kavanaugh and by extension Republicans as well\nSo clearly that's at least in my opinion that's obvious as to what's happening\nAnd so flick it's been sitting here talking about how this was a ripping America apart and well yeah I Would agree this is absolutely ripping America part but what's ripping America part is the fact that this this judge who is led far as I can tell a in a very good well ah well led life\nTheir centrally saying that he's a drunken rapist\nAnd said I got all these all these Democrats were running around on all the all the Saturday Sunday talk shows and everything what we'd enough he has the temperament to be a Supreme Court judge I'd like to see how you act if you're called the drunken rapist on national television in all the media\nI'm hearing I'm a a very smart I'm anguished person who did not want to be testifying in front of us and meanwhile my phone is just blowing up it was stunning the number of people I heard from during the hearing\nUh that that it was there was almost hard to know which to listen to more because the things coming in were so striking and they were saying what they were like knocked you've known me a very long time and I was raped as a child and I've never told anyone before right now and I'm sharing it with you\nThan what you need to do is you need to go to the authorities if this is something that that happened to you you know we have and I played the audio fighter earlier of Ana Marie are killer and also another woman by the name of Maria Gallagher and so these are two women who have been dubbed heroes\nBy many on the left in one of the things that I Wonder is what is this all is set up and I want you to think about this 'cause 'cause let's not forget this is all about optics right this is all about the narrative of the people on the left\nAnd so we know that they are constantly trying to uh absolutely batter Republicans and conservatives and Donald Trump\nAnd so I just kind of wonder so you've got Jeff Flake trying to get to the Senate Judiciary committee meeting where he's supposed to vote he has already announced that he is going to and this is all on friday\nHe's already announced that he's going to a confirmed vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh so somehow magically these women find him in the elevator\nWith a whole bunch of cameras into and he got flake cowering in an elevator\nAnd you remember my comments on friday\nWhen I just wanted to see flake said something to the extent of well she has no proof\nHer story forwards has no credibility\nThere's holes all the way through her story how can you sit here and scream about\nHow I'm putting someone who is actually done this on the Supreme Court when clearly there is no proof that he's actually done this\nBut flake decided for whatever reason I think because this is all I Would say some sort of a some sort of a movement on the left to recruit him and give him a reason\nNot to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so it wouldn't surprise me if this was something that was all well orchestrated on the left\nWhere they sent these women after flake all the TV cameras were into okay I'm going to be in the ... the elevator at this time come get me will make sure that the cameras are there will make sure that we don't close the elevator doors and so you have four and a half minutes\nOf screaming and that way I can walk in all the shamed into the Senate Judiciary committee and I can work with senator Coons and we can then come up with a way to delay the confirmation vote and ... in the way the the vote to send it to the the full Senate floor\nAnd so to me anyway that this whole thing seems to be seems to be a set up\nNow one of the things also that you have to think about as you had Maria Gallagher and Anna Maria are chill up but both of these women\nIs there is no proof that anything untoward happened to these women either you you just don't know and that is unfortunately where we are in America today by the way we know that both of these women are again\nHave connections to George Soros so this whole movement from hash tag me to to the blue wave to the the blood of sexism that the Democrats are planning to use in the mid term elections we all know that this is part of a a far bigger movement of the resistance and that's what\nObama and Hillary Clinton and all these other folks are are all about you can talk about the Dianne Feinstein and about how\nShe decided that it would be a good idea to go ahead and and and Lindsey Graham is saying he's going to go after a Feinstein and get to the bottom as to who exactly it was that leaked the letter that Christine Ford wrote ultimately to\nDianne Feinstein Lindsey Graham says we're going to find out who did this\nWhat am I my my absolute favorite moments in the uh in the Senate Judiciary committee meeting and all the hearings was when and the testimony was when Feinstein had to look behind her and said or we're the ones that lead to this no that wasn't it wasn't us\nUnless Graham saying I'm gonna find out who did do this and and as I said on friday\nKeeping Christine forward anonymous\nDid absolutely nothing for the Democrats and for the liberals for their narrative and for what they were hoping to do because let's face it what the Democrats wanted to do is they wanted this hearing they wanted this testimony they wanted all of this ugliness to come out\nAnd so the letter was leaked to I think it was either the Washington Post and the New York times doesn't even matter and so that led to the the testimony to hearing the testimony and ultimately the delay and they're trying to move it all the way down past the mid term elections as we all know also\nNow let's not forget the narrative from this morning and the news cycle this morning\nWhich is you got Jane's call me out there and\nBy the way I'm I'm not even mentioning the fact that we may or may not be able to or even trust the FBI to carry out a an unbiased investigation\nBut that's going to also be part of the discussion and that is you've got James calmly pending an op ed or whatever it is and the New York times saying well you can't put a timetable on the FBI so all ready even though there was a negotiation\nWith the FBI and even though there was a negotiation between Jeff Flake and the Republicans and the Democrats that this particular FBI investigation would be something that was narrow scope and time now you have the people on the left saying well this is simply not good enough\nBecause you can't put a timetable on the FBI so I guarantee you there's a lot more to come the other thing I Wonder and I don't know family if you know or they'll you know when did the timetable start so in other words they came out and they said that the FBI had a week\nWhen when did that start and you know they started\nI Know they started friday and I'm pretty sure they did after the president said okay let's go ahead and did as I Believe they started like friday afternoon\nPro unless you're a Democrat than the timetable starts the day after the election\n[laughter] and why are they yeah they've been investigating yeah they they spend\nBy the way the man who was shot this

Know you know they could never do\nNo go ahead [laughter]\nActually is the president you said that it's incorrect to say you're limiting the ... of the FBI investigation\nWhat is it has to do is read I don't mind answer that question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the days which is the candidate and I know how old are talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think that anybody ever trade or trade deal with hats or Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think\nSo I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it a industry loves it our country loves it or if it's fair\nIt will pass I think it'll

we'll\nGet back to your question that's exactly right at it a couple a times\nYes he did do an ...\nSee I think I think one of the things that people are missing is that they're well conveniently missing but there really is no decorum anymore and the president is absolutely right he's signing a big deal for between Mexico Canada and United States this is something that\nHe has been working on for a long time and this is a huge\n... a huge story at least it is for the president because he is paying off on one of his big campaign promises so for the president makes a lot of sense to want to talk about this and unfortunately the media they really only one to talk about one thing by the way a new poll is just come out apparently\nA forty eight percent of Americans versus forty two percent of Americans\nForty percent of Americans are apparently against a confirming a judge Brett Kavanaugh forty to forty two percent you know it's interesting though I Would have thought that it would have been a ... a lot more because of the fact that there's been so much meat and that's a Quinnipiac poll by the way\nI as those women were a little irrational he say something like that man I mean they're liable to bring out the clause and I don't mean that in their in a sex is way behind I mean they were that they were very emotional right to the point I mean I could just see them lunging

where I'm going is it just feels like the Republicans are they are so incredibly spineless and\nYou know look at look at all the ... for example that the graph we did now Grassley didn't have a choice because if you've got if you've got enough Jeff Flake out there if you've got flaking that Lisa Murkowski came out and and she also supported flick well then all of a sudden if you're Chuck Grassley you don't have a choice\nIs either allow the FBI to do whatever it is that they need to do in their investigation or have a thumbs down vote on a judge a cabinet also that's going to be the bottom line is okay so once the FBI has their investigation\nIf there is nothing that you just squalor disqualifying for judge Kavanaugh then the Republicans are going to have to make that vote now once the
