{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Well it reminds me how we really do have to take that initiative on our own ... and really search out and find folks who are you mentioned fiduciary in the past how important is to find someone who is a fiduciary and it's not just claiming to be working in your best interests 'cause that's really the heart of the conversation isn't it\nGo to the advisor who specializes in risk and ask them how to have a safe income plan and here's what you hear [noise] and that's unfortunate because if we are fifty two older then I started before I was there because I'm In this financial arena and I want to make sure to build myself retirement plans I was called back of the day when they the ... channel did a\nBiography about me his appeared on about our show when everything oh well they called me the Mike either financial world because I Try\nEverything before I recommended anybody okay and so maybe the life zero commercial enough and so if I'm like a human guinea pig here vote in tests rapid and Peter Rabbit right so what are what I'll do though is I'm not talking about something on the air unless I really believe in it and we unfortunately in this financial world when we're talking about retirement planning\nMany people are ignoring that and they're hoping that everything will just work out fine they've got a lump sum again lump sum great sure but until you can translate what that lump sum really means for not income for next year or ten years but for a lifetime but I don't want you but for your spouse\nAnd if he passed away two which anytime you passed away sue sue\nWe wanted we call it taken the limousine they haven't right that's right but when that happens you want to make sure that whatever money you have put aside doesn't disappear it goes onto the next to Ken doesn't disappear and go into someone else's pocket and that's called planning\nAnd it's not just financial sales putting in the best investments for today that's crazy by the way it is it is putting you into a plan and once we have that plan built then we can take the leftover money money that you don't need for income and you can you can basically take risk with it if you want yeah\nWhat you know what people usually tell me after we build the perfect plan for retirement was that 'cause I Want to put more in it [laughter]\nI don't want to put this money exposed right yeah but I Do have a lot of people I recommend keep maybe fifty thousand ... Scott trade account or something like that okay and buy and sell some stocks on their own or whatever it just keeps your mind sharp yeah yeah yeah and it keeps them you know happy and researching and all that but it's even if they lost all that money\nThey still have okay they still have the more they're they're all important there the rock as they are ... rock is there it's going to be there it's going to give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd this is very important to me it really is and that's the way too many people have seen in my years in twenty five years\nI see people who thought they were fine until the market rip the carpet out from under him and then they had to rebuild all over again sort of like taking an ant hill over there you know in advance come back and rebuild but all that time that could have been building a palace precisely it however that you're having to start over again and that's what happens\nStarting over again is not any fun now and especially if you're already we're to the point where you don't need to take any risk because you already have the income you need for retirement or you already have the money that could get you the income you need a retirement but your current winner hadn't told you about it and so if you're one of the next twenty call was as we leave for the week here keeping my folks if you get a busy signal keep trying Thomas is going to give you the number out in a minute\nBut if you're one of the next twenty people who go we're going to do for you a one page financial review\nAnd this review will indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial a retirement plan and this is a very important review and it's about a nine hundred dollar value when you when you factor in all the time\nWe're going to give us away you get into the next twenty people no obligation or fees\nAnd it's complimentary if you win the next twenty people who have at least two hundred thousand dollar save for retirement\nNow what this will consist of is taking the mystery out of the retirement planning process by mapping out for you where you are right now we're also going to run a fee report folks and this was in lightning if not it does make you happy sometimes but will help you on tangle with working with your current plan or advisor is truly costing you\nAnd to see if I simply protecting your retirement investment you could experience what we call dramatic growth potential\nYou know who hates us the analysis who's at your current advisor many time home though 'cause we expose things that have been financial termites in show you why you have financial evaporation and your portfolio that doesn't need to be happening we're also going to perform attacks analysis that also could reveal how you could possibly reduce your tax is very important because the more money we can save you the more money you have for retirement for yourself\nWe're going to also run the most important part as a customizing complained that utilizes the proven bucket strategy and strength other strategies intact\nTakes which could turbo charged retirement income if you do that folks you take the ... out of living in retirement it's short will help you take a guess work out of the financial and retirement planning process for the next twenty call was that's a comprehensive plan to review going to give away it's a nine hundred no you don't do that you know ... ... for the next twenty dollars\nJust like we've been tackling problems on the show today we can help you assessed your plan and your outlook for retirement to make sure that you are on a secure path\nJust limited but complementary review will help you determine how prepared your investments are to handle all the retirement pitfalls we talked about on the show does include inflation Social Security healthcare emergencies so many things to stock market volatility\nRisk taxation but here's the thing folks most important we want to show you how to produce a lifetime retirement income planned a strike folks an income plan\nTo last your entire lifetime not just the lifespan of a bank account\nNow the number to call in and meet with Evan Gallo or who are coach Pete's local trusted financial coaches in your area is eight hundred nine nine one seven zero six zero\nWhen you call and you will receive a comprehensive retirement

Republican Senator Marco Rubio towns NBC's Meet the press at the impact of the storm on the Florida Panhandle has been disaster\nMost disc injuries are a sharing type of an injury so what does that mean specifically for you it's very simple so we've got so you get your five or ... and above and below the vertebrae have disks well what you have front to back because you actually have seven sick ligaments that hold your spine from front to back\nAnd it's these ... these front to back ligaments they're like basically like seven pieces of duct tape the duct tape this whole piece together so that when you bend and twist and stretch it it's it all move normally the problem is is that when you have an injury specifically this can be\nA you know been over to pick something weird I'm your whiplash most people by the way it's a whiplash or you think of whiplash and your neck but but really whiplash has just come into the low back maybe even more common\nI'm used to be a little bit more common when he just had the last belt you see people with major whiplash lumbar spine because they'd have a car accident with just the last ... not the shoulder hardest but now see more with Washington next\nAnyways regardless I work at a sea whip washing low back and that's anytime you fall down slip and fall on the ice scoop with last year low back anytime that you are playing football and he tackled boom whiplash Slovak any sound that you get a better way to pick something up super heavy you're straying those ligaments\nSo what happens when you restrain ligaments in our back we stretch military him now are ligaments cannot supply\nI needed a reinforcement for the shearing force and guess what takes that brought the disc does the disc does in your lumbar spawn\nWhen you're just doesn't do that ... that shearing force now we start to lose the curve and are low back in every time we walk quest you wind up putting a strain on our lumbar disk\nOf course is easier to show you with a picture but we're talking on radio no we have the radio so I'm trying to explain to you so what is the fix here for ... for low back issues as well as you can imagine basically what we've done is we've torn ligament for some sort of a lumbar injury\nWith tons of torn the front to back ligaments and now we have instability in our desk\nAnd way of instability of our disc now we're going to have those ... that was called the nucleus in the report that part of the disc starts to rip those any other fibers risk rip those disc fibers that can put pressure on your nerves cause all kinds of issues cause you're back to lock up\nSo the big question here the the twenty million dollar question is what do you do to fix it because here's what doesn't work\nIf you have a torn ligament and all you do is take pain medication right so you take ibuprofen your back hurts take ibuprofen\nWhat's that going to do is going to make you not feel the pain so what you're going to do to gonna wind up walking around in read damaging maybe even extra damaging the the the disks and you're back because you're not feeling the pain there's nothing in your body to stop you\nFrom abnormally moving your body if that makes it\nSo that's obviously going to be just a terrible idea is to take pain medication I let me ask you about this with surgery what do they do a surgery as well as surgery they go through and they wind up cleaning up the desk so if you've ever heard of ... which by the way to talk about how you're just can heal itself in a second\nUm but if you're just has a hernia operation\nThen the surge is going to go through and tried to trim off those ... well that doesn't fix the problem because again the problem is you have instability of the ligaments of your lumbar spine so what do we do here first and foremost\nIs we have to re approximate the bone so generally speaking when you stretch in terrible ligament in your back to the bones have basically become separated stretches ligaments\nSo the first thing we do do do we need to move the bones closer to each other so that way the ligaments can include themselves back together well how do you do that well it's real simple eight chiropractic adjustment some people to come to that so dumb I don't believe in our project this some sort of a witchcraft well actually the opposite of witchcraft\nIs actually a matter of fact the most common sense that you could possibly do if you move over at a position in her back to you need to move back in the right position yes and not only that but don't you need to be able to have an X ray or something to tell you is the boat in the wrong position and if I moved it is it in the right position\nAnd would it be great if you could just shoot an X ray of your back to see if there's a stability issue in the ligaments in her back\nBefore you started so that is what I Do that is why I'm actually a part of a group of holistic our project Nashville they have some of the largest carpet officers in the world\nBecause we have specific corrective techniques that specifically deal with making sure to re stabilize ligaments out next I mean I'm Talking about arthritis and talk about a little bit more the rehab of the muscles cause that's something that we also do but\nIf I have a media only got your attention maybe got somewhere to be right now you can't listen to

I got to do this now you got to run to the next thing you don't have time to sit in a car listen to this\nUm guys that's why we do that offer that's why we we do this show is for people just like you maybe you're dealing with headaches or migrant issues maybe got blood pressure she says thyroid issues\nThe vets you by the way you know stay tuned to this radio show 'cause we're always talking about you know a siren issues blood pressure issues\nOn the obviously cancers going off and it sounds ridiculous but it's not ridiculous we see people who used to get sick all the time they used to get the flu shot\nAnd now they don't do that junk anymore because they keep their body healthy um of course you know later in the show we'll talk about nutrition and detox you know this stuff that's just what we do it all day long and if you were to come to the office will teach you all about that for free on because it's such a big deal more so passionate\nA show I don't know there were a lot of seats on radio but we're going to come here\nSo Cindy is one of these big moody ladies you know what I'm saying\nUm [noise] we might refer to this is again a ... it is what it is if you got it flaunted no big deal\nBut because of that she had a lot of low back pain um she heard it on the radio host came and again just for the record her name is not Cindy because she can't say that on the radio well guess what I'm saying on the radio her name is not Cindy I'm a man living on the other side is laughing at me\nUm but ah she did have a big moody she came to the office because she has some low back pain turns out that these are all these people um that was a I Believe she was an ex gymnast or cheerleaders something and uh she had a lot of um just a lot of ... years sharp pain or low back\nAnd and I think that what happened is is when she was a kid she wound up stretching Chinese ligaments in her back from her gymnastics in sports that you won't have having kids later in life which puts a lot of pressure\nAnd um where she got the ghetto booty and what that does that caused all that low back pain so what are we going to do from Mississippi um and and uh the reality is that we need to reach stabilize the limits are back for Andrew was caused from an instability of the ligaments in our lumbar spawn\nThen the fix is to re stabilize Les Mis ... rather than we shot a set of X rays ... there's a problem right there er which by the way not to do with the ghetto but he has to do with the injuries that you've had\nA a dumb you by the way she was convinced she had to sway back and she didn't um she actually just had tore ligaments in her ... and ... what do you think toward leaving the walking around a wheel you know she's in a wheelchair crush it that's not how it works when you stretch into ligaments\nNow your muscles have to come in and re stabilized causes a lot of basically low back pain do ag pain you know at the end of the day you're ... feel tired and worn out and after a while it winds up being that sharp stabbing kind of pain that's where that's the point that she was out\nWe shot her X rays ligament stretching torn low back what gets you ever sit very clearly in the X rays and do what we could see the position of the vertebrae which indicates that the ... the the L ligaments have been stretching torn and um we did adjustment\nAnd what that does re approximate those ... Cindy story was one that is kind a typical on you hear me telling me about these stories of people to get adjusted one time and poof it's all gone well Cindy story was not that story she had to rehab for Baca took a few weeks before she was able to feel massive relief and the reason is because\nHer her um muscles down there had been doing so much work for so long there's so much\nScar tissue in and spasm and those muscles that we had to break up and had a short some exercises and editors heal up right course we adjusted her we work through that but she's somebody who had back pain you're kinda stabbing back pain for probably Fifteen or Twenty years and within about thirty days it was completely gone\nFeeling completely better she moves great life is good she's able to go back to exercise and work and sit in a car no stabbing pain\nDespite the ghetto booty by the way it's all good yeah I Love it um and it's all better listen if you watched any\nAnd and you've had some of these

wanted stretching attorneys ligaments and what that causes instability when you're ... in stable that's going to or unstable it's going to cause your desk to ... basically the the nucleus to ... to strip through that disk and that causes ... all kinds of bad stuff\nBut what it also does cause your muscles to have to fire I'm inspires them to stabilize those forever because the the ligaments can't do it so that the muscles have to do it and that causes your back to the soaring ATF particularly the end of the day it just feels really tired well if you don't do anything about this for long

above listen I of Dr been it's been an awesome Eris you all this health is out of the radio catch it actually [noise]\nHenderson veil Nashville\nYou were on I mean I [noise]\nMissing reporter hurricane Michael I'm Anne Kane Saudi Arabia says that rejects any threat to the economic sanctions over the case of a missing journalist Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida tells CNN state of the union and if the Saudis are behind the presumed murder and the Gulf kingdom deserves to be punished if\nThey lower this man into that caught so let's say one medieval on him and he was killed and it was chopped up and they sent us that the crew down there to kill them and do all this that'd be an outrage and just because they're an ally and an important mission which is containing Iranian expansion in the region and not allow us to overlook a walk away from that\nAnd if they really wanted to get something done they do it and not tell us about until afterwards instead of talking about what they want to do well yeah playing with each other [laughter] comedy simple I think Don Knotts in a movie when somebody came up to the apple dumpling gang who they are looking for the the bad guys and he said they went that way\nAnd actually what Congress the other one isn't\nIt yeah absolutely so do you think that there's any sort of economic impact that if we if we rushed to find everything is not going to impact the economy as a whole\nI think it'd be a great advantage for people to at least start putting some money into Iraq sure yeah I mean so you don't want to do it all I always recommend as I wrote the book on baby steps so bright baby steps into it\nAnd gradually shift the thinking away from the immediate tax write off that we do when we put money in an area for gay rights to a long term tax benefit when you're not paying tax on money to build and and also I go into a farmer and the farmer has a has an offer them the IRS as we can either not tax you on that little bag\nSeats but they come back every single year in tax you on the harvest until you die and then we'll be out of your family then sure or we'll tax you one time and this little bag of seeds and you're never see it's again what would you do\nWell you know it's like I said okay yeah they got out what the other thing is we're talking about anything [laughter] I got up and do that by the Congress [laughter] yeah so I mean we\nPaint with such big brushes these days and big paint row where we should get out the little fine paint brushes and look at what's very important and so a little amount put into a raw the very small paintbrush can turn into a masterpiece for retirement down the road if done right because you won't have Uncle Sam on your behind every single year want money from that again\nAbsolutely well I think that really based on what you're telling me we just have to keep an eye on Congress keep all people handle on all of that and a given\nI Congress huh [laughter] when I got that trying\nTo solve that [laughter] I don't care as a news guy [laughter] I'm going to have an object [laughter]\nWell I'm a jeopardy too I I really have admitted the fact that they don't get much done there though I well I don't recognize one kind of an odd that they can talk a war with\nWith five fat guys on each side double the rope is moving [laughter] that look like they're working hard well well you know that's it that's kind of metaphor that well I really think\nThat everyone guessing though the first step is to stop worried about everybody else and that includes Congress and start warned about yourself\nAnd so if you're one of the next ten cars we want to do this we will custom designed your very own retirement savings plan including looking at raw what the Ross could do

amoral cultural issues through your goals for retirement a legacy Wyoming and implemented total retirement income flam taking into account all\nWell guys I thought we'd start this segment off with a trivia question how's that going to have yeah and it's about what is your retirement savings IQ when again sometimes has no right or wrong answer but this was thought provoking\nAll right so the question is how much do I need to save for retirement [laughter] well we don't have to give you this number ... five hundred thousand but he is a million or more or see is enough for a comfortable paycheck in retirement what's the answer would you think is most of ethical for people listening see\nYeah right correct correct I didn't start digging name\n[laughter] I might add on board is that the shock getting picked up where I Would have pressed a button or give me that just on board ever hear\nThe answer is either numbers different for everyone and has influenced by many factors your goal is to save enough to guarantee yourself comfortable income\nWhen you're no longer working that's important because I mean when you don't have a paycheck coming in the money put aside has to turn into the paycheck and to calculate your retirement savings needs\nYou really need to sit down with someone who is qualified to look at inflation taxation and make sure you're in the right place and not take too much risk and not be eaten alive with financial termites too many fees and your plan\nWe can do that for anyone who calls right now Thomas will make sure to sit down with them and make sure they get the plan that is most more comfortable for them as well as looking at where you are right now when you're four one K. uh-huh they sure you're not taking too much risk or not taking

'cause that's the only option to make sense and a four one K. you take a lot of risk you don't even know you're taking 'cause you just say you look at what the performance was last year this put my money and that's where we K option well a lot of times if it did it will last year what's going to happen this year\nThe opposite then you know so but what does Murphy's law say whatever you do is going to be world or so but the most underfunded of the three categories and it's very alarming to me because it's the only reason we put money and the other two\nIs into and unless we have lifetime income that is gonna increase force in the future it's durable predictable and we'll never go away we don't have a true retirement plan\nAnd so in order to take a financial planner converted to a retirement plan which is the only reason why we even have a financial planning to begin with less we're not going to retire in the diet sixty five whatever but nobody wants to do that I don't know of course not a good option\nWe need income so we need to do income conversion strategy is looking at where you have your money now and how much income could you get for the rest of your wife based on the amount of money you have\nNot putting it all in one place but saying hey if I have let's say I have five hundred thousand in my retirement account how about taking three hundred thousand of getting an income playing with that now you've got your core we call it that's money you're never going to lose and is always going to be there and could increase your income in the future but never go way every single year give you a check\nAnd then once you have your core it's a lot easier to take the other two hundred thousand if none of them to court and use what we call explore it's easier to take risk and more risk because we know we already have received money put aside\nAgain turning Murphy's law upside down because now you canceled out the fact that if everything went wrong and you also that whole two hundred dollars and you still have that three hundred thousand for income and the incomes ever going away\nSo that's what most people overlooks the is the government's grip absolutely and again if my ... wasn't in the shop right now I Would hit the big big button was super today by the way\nI literally yeah let me ask you coach I I Know I'm In my early thirties right now so I'm very much in that accumulation phase do you find that when folks are\nFinancial red zone do you find that they struggle making that mentality transition\nWell especially if they haven't thought about it beforehand okay do mistakes are made when we rushed into any decision and especially if we're with the wrong planner who doesn't have access to everything out there were trying to push to one place where you shouldn't be ... you think about if you have a plan or who is try to design an income plan that will give you an income for the rest of the life\nOf you do you think they're really taking care of you and I'm really I mean without a doubt\nOr you're good at Weiner says oh you do need to worry about income now let's keep the money or the and that's been expanding the wheel and see what happens yeah and what I'm going to happen well you could make a lot more money but what's the opposite side you could lose a lot of ... so again risk safety income if you have too much money at risk and none in safety\nAnd you're planning on getting it didn't come play in the future and you didn't want to put in income now you should convert some of the money from the risk account at least to save a cow that you couldn't lose in the stock market tumbled if it ever happened huh okay\nKeep in mind we're in one of the longest bull markets in history right now and also what keeps coming to my mind as what goes up\nCan come down exactly so we don't know if you keep going up too but we're\nThe cat did I just mentioned we are in one of the longest bull market it's not the longest bull markets in history\nSooner or later things come in in\nMy New England patriots were Eighteen or one year [laughter] uh they didn't finish undefeated right so you never know right there with the team that nobody can beat until they get laws they got to be so that same thing in the market so the market mentality needs to we need to tame down risk and we need to increase income\nWell let's talk about you you talk about that financial red zone strike and the four oh one K. and rolling it over tell me the advantage of rolling their four O. one K. over even if you're still working and even if your if your employer allows\nYeah we call it a sweeping the money out so you get you you keep your four one K. it doesn't affect your four one K. you don't have to take all your money out of four one K. you sweep out what you want into an income plan so now you keep the money into four one K. do you want to leave there and you keep putting new money and keep getting the tax write off or whatever but you sweep proportion over to income plan\nAnd it goes tax free by the way you sweep it over tax rates you don't pay taxes on that\nAnd the advantages now you've got diversification\nSo because most for one case don't offer income they offer growth which they do a good job of that they also growth ... many of them do don't give you all the choices that you really should get so maybe the growth they're offering isn't like the growth you want but the growth you want is right outside all you have to do a sweep it into your own IRA and now you can have the growth accounts do you want\nThey don't avail when you're four one K. usually for one case I have like thirty options right well there's about ten thousand a more options available demand right now and you have thirty often so which which account would be better for you for more choice vote tomorrow ten thousand options and the government's enabled if you're fifty nine and a half you can roll the money\nSweep it out of your four one K. into your own account or if you leave your current employer\nDon't leave an orphan four one K. behind rolling into your own individual irate very important\nAnd that's a good time to consult with you yeah you know what the heck's going\nOn and so the the hardest part of the financial world is saving money to begin with so if you're in that position\nThe worst thing you could do is not get a plan put together and just keep assuming that everything you've been doing is going to be fine going forward we need to income plan so let's do this if you're one of the next ... years ago and right now have at least two hundred thousand dedicated for retirement\nWe'll ... we'll sit down with you and go through a total plan if their strategic development process number one we'll review your tax returns to uncover any long term tax issues like our existing now in your for one case you're IRAs or capital gains and Social Security taxes going forward also established a retirement income go how much money do you want and need\nAnd we went to the videotape we ran the numbers we have Peter program so there was no playing with the ... right and so after Thirty years the account with no these again you started with two hundred thousand you gained six percent a year you want to take a guess what the what the amount would be in that a lot\nYeah but I think it was on fire today [laughter] I Need to take [laughter]\nOne million one hundred forty eight thousand in that ... or ... or they put in two hundred thousand and one time left it alone let it grow set it and forget it Thirty years later that's what it's worth because nobody's were coming out right\nAll right they count with one percent fees Thirty years later again started with two hundred thousand same everything at the end a Thirty Years' worth eight hundred and sixty three thousand so again why point one million versus eight sixty three which would you rather have while the other one on but now the bad one three percent\nFees which unfortunately some have been identified some four one K. plans or plants in general have been identified with three percent or more fees financial termites like all that praise them yeah\nStart with two hundred thousand six percent interest Thirty years later it's worth four hundred and eighty four thousand gosh now again with a cat with no fees one million one hundred forty eight thousand the account with three percent fees eating alive like you're talking about the example yes which is just on cue if your example really\nFour hundred and eighty four thousand of who's going to have a better retirement the guy with no these are the guy with three percent face well clearly the guy with no now who's brokers going to have a better retired\nAt the guy would [laughter] [laughter] yeah so that retirement\nOf your funding yours or your brokers\nSo it's one more thing just another hidden way that they're taking fees from us on our for one case you really become a sitting duck for estate taxes yeah sets up I'm really heard about your\nAccount turns into a financial zombie and then it gets ... home that I always have to be very\nCareful on that so there are ways to set up what we call ... plans do you set and forget it where where you could spend money and then when you pass away you make sure that your your spouse or your children\nGet whatever you started with her more we called the pension maximus Asian strategies to so you can spend what you have here and then when the state taxes get hit you can have some money designed to bypass the state taxes go tax returns next again these are all planting techniques that are available\nBut if we wait to the last minute or never get to it\nIt's never going to happen right you know Tom Petty just passed away he was only sixty something years old I've been waiting to do as a state plan a couple of years from now when he when he hit Seventy sure cause Seventy is like the magic age when people start thinking about it but he did he passed away before Seventy sure so when is the best time to plan for the future today today yesterday yeah not tomorrow or next week\nYeah well it's something that you brought up coaches one is the best time to plant a tree and it was Twenty years ago and in and start you know talking to a state planning right now I think of myself even at thirty three I Want to get started today because you don't know where life is going to take you really don't well the number one time to plant a tree was too especially apple tree was Twenty years ago when offered to tie\nIs today that's right so don't put off to tomorrow what can be done today and and one of the things people can do Thomas and give a call right now and if they do\nWill designed for them will go through everything we talked about today on the show which we covered a lot we have to worry about your pension plan if you're with a defined benefit plan where you where you're working for us the state government or local government or even a company that has defined benefit plan that means they are defining what your benefit is we're in the end of the state they're taking money out of your paycheck\nOr if you would a defined contribution plan which is a four one K. plan your defining how much you're putting in each pay period that's why they call it a defined contribution plan\nThese acronyms are thrown around all the time to be in the DC and no one even knows what it means I Know when I hear DC it\nWas sausage factory or something but\nWashington DC right yep so I think that people just need to sit down and take a time out and get everything adjusted we don't want to to live our financial world like Roy Williams does with basketball coach and get keeps all his time outside yet\nLet's take a financial time out right now with sit down let's get organized and wife is a whole lot simpler once we get everything organized and we know what's happening and were educated and then you can turn into the resource for other employees that there aren't too sure about what's going on their plan but there's three key elements in a retirement plan\nAnd one is risk one is safety and one is income and we've already talked about how important income is so if you have a lump sum that's great but let's see what the lump sum could be\nFor lifetime income you can never elsewhere but if you're over fifty nine and a half or if you left the company and yet for what case scattered all over the place\nWas consolidate them let's build a true plan was to take the philosophy of advance to protect let's make sure your money moves forward but go backwards especially the money you need for retirement and what's used the core and explore philosophy what type of corporate income but to have that income increase we knew the most\nAnd then what's explore put money in the market after we've got our safe money put aside it makes a lot of sense I mean we're true

address that issue it's quite an epidemic people are just not sleeping so they're not getting well they're not healing out they're not getting that good quality sleep like they're supposed to [noise]\nSo we will have to handle the adrenal glands now once we got the adrenal glands good and strong we want to make sure that all the other glands in Oregon's nutrition wise are good and strong and we may at that point see the blood pressure start to stabilize and may start to see us start to go down\nNow I don't take anybody off of medications I make recommendations are that they come off the medication and a recommend that to go see their doctor and their doctor will usually adjust the medication\nOr I had a gentleman in this weekend we were talking he's been on the program for a while now and uh I'd say about eight or nine months he was on he had high cholesterol high blood pressure\nOr several other things we talked about his blood pressure and his cholesterol is Dr has already taken him off as a cholesterol medicine his blood pressure medicine is down to a quarter a of the uh of what he was taking\nAnd he said next time is it seizes doctor the doctors already made the statement taken him off of the rest of the high blood pressure medicine\nAnd what we did is exactly what I just told you we went in we handled the glands in Oregon Scott I'm good and strong then we went in and we cleaned up the systems now we always have to clean up the systems and what I mean by systems is your liver\nYour liver is a system it's a detoxification system we've got to make sure that that's the tax fine and eliminating things out of the body nuts storing them in the body\nA well also have to uh handled the intestinal tract make sure that that uh things are moving out if they don't move out your body will re absorb them in and they'll be re absorb back into the body\nAnd then the Clinton kidneys so we want to go in and we want to clean those systems out the kidney intestinal tract deliver make sure that those systems that excrete things out of the body or working really really well\nUh now this all takes time it's not going to happen overnight a so we want to make sure that the person is actually committed to doing this\nAnd then once we got the a glance good and strong we got the systems cleaned up and what I mean by cleaning them up we're going to be doing a detox we're gonna detoxify and pull things out that\nShouldn't be there and get these glands in Oregon's working better then we can get down on that sell your level and start cleaning up the toxins and that's the true problem is getting down on that so your level now you hear a lot of doctors talking about a ... year this ... year that\nUh and then I go in and I find out what they're doing and they're not really using true binders or they're using\n'em herbs and stuff like that which is fine they used it for many many many years but in my office we use what they call a true binders they actually bind to the heavy metals or the toxins and they pull them out of the body a lotta times you go in you do a detox\n'em and sell your detox and they're using herbs now that mainly what I found as it moves around from one area to another doesn't really bind to it and next greeted out\nNow when I'm working on a cellular level we use a formula for a company called systemic formula and uh they make true binders are there is a system on how to uh pull that out\nAnd we got to get the person healthy enough to be able to get down on that sell your level and start removing toxins now once we put that all together that's what happens to the blood pressure\nIt all starts to come down back to normal again\nSo these problems that we have um most people are just managing these problems are not fixing the problem when you come to my office that is what we're looking to do we're looking to fix the problem\nWe don't want to manage it uh keep you on high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life we got to find out and dig down deep and find out what's going on and why did that blood pressure go up\nNot using blood pressure is just an example we do the same thing with a high blood sugar there's a reason for that too as long as you're diabetic type to uh we got a great chance of raw reversing a the blood sugar if you follow my advice and\nUh also um high blood sugar high

question about either ... or anything you can do for that other than taking the medicine that the doctor is\nYes and now it's just an adult or is it a child\nAnd I doubt out right now actually\nOK yeah usually what I find ah in Ninety eight percent of the adults in almost a hundred percent of the children it's a pituitary problem you're pituitary gland is a little tiny gland it sits right in the middle of the brain and uh as its ... developing a people can't uh\nThey can't focus like young people can focus their jittery they want to go out and do things are so to just support that there's a couple of things one is called um but to a trophy and ... is a a product that has all the nutrition for the uh\nFor the pituitary gland has a little bit of thyroid or support in there to ... pm gee is what that's called and then the other one that works well is called um\n... and ... and is is more of a a blend of herbs that helps to stimulate the pathways and the transmitters the brains are transmitters um\nTo get the the pathways open so that uh there's better communication in there it also works on the mitochondria is the energy factories that are actually in the pituitary gland itself\nBut those two should make a a quite a difference now the person's gonna have to watch out what their sugar they're gonna have to cut their sugar down if they're big sugar eater\nAnd it that makes it worse or\nYeah that that'll ... that'll make it worse or overtime or ... or\n... let's put it this way the sugar will overcome the nutrition you just cannot get good nutrition in if somebody is eating a lot of sugar like I was saying earlier that the rules should be about Seventy five ... ... per day or twenty five per meal if they're eating up three uh three meals\nBut anything over that the um the body will overwhelm the nutrition and you're not going to get a lot of results so and sometimes they they just got they have to kinda just work on that like when somebody comes to my office\nWe may I help them fill out a food diary and we might work on breakfast for two or three weeks and just kind of cleaned breakfast up so you take it on a gradient\nAs we're getting the nutrition in there but as are cutting back on the the sugars and the carbohydrates I'm the nutrition starts to work in and do you have to kind of build a foundation there but why not\nThe man didn't try him on that because that would help\nWell ... is good and I that would be another thing that could be helpful but ... is mainly a calming minerals is what ... is still kind of calm things down rather than like addressing the pituitary gland\nNow if this pituitary gland is a very stressed out and and ah over compensating men trend would help to to come that down a little bit if there's any anxious ... or ... or nervousness involved", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dan Mandis", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "14"}
