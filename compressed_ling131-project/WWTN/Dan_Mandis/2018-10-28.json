... your welcome Joshua producer here he says yes that's right you got it so what causes inflation I'm going to a clear up this thing that we've talked about is called the omega\n... the omega fats if you've ever heard of a mega three\nOmega six and omega nine most people haven't heard too Americanized called recognize Ghassan but omega three omega six on making those or or um or omega facts and the thing about your these um essential fatty acids as they are either pro inflammatory or anti inflammatory so\nYour body actually is in inflammation is actually in natural process um if you didn't have any information\nThan you'd actually if you fell down to scrape up your knees would bleed out from your in the um there would be no clotting factor there would be no healing of your organs so information it's very important as soon as they very natural normal process\nBut to many inflammatory\nUm properties inside of your body is what causes you to have tons of pain\n... tons of back pain this is the kind of thing that causes back pain and headaches and\nIn the shoulder pain and finger paying I Can't say how many patients come in the office we start cleaning up there in their information in their diet and their their old arthritic shoulder pain and guess what proof goes away I'm there need pain on and on the edge or my niece Thirty years playing basketball only remove the inflation then they're needed her anymore they Dr man I thought\nYou need a knee surgery well guess what I'm you're probably not because we've removed the inflammation so omega three six and nine omega three is anti inflammatory\nVery very important to understand the omega three is at times laboratory omega six is pro inflammatory so threes anti inflammatory or making six is pro inflammatory\nSo what a here's an interesting fact is you actually need a ratio of one two three or one to four omega threes to make us sick so actually you need to have more pro inflammatory\nFatty acids then you need anti inflammatory fatty acids I Know it sounds crazy but it gives we talked about inflation is a natural process so we get you need ... for every omega for one omega three you need\nThree omega six or wonder is reassuring moral making six but you would never want a supplemental may get sick it's pro inflammatory the problem is the United states we are so full of omega ...\nFatty acids 'cause guess where you get omega ... fatty acids ready for this but bump bum grain you get it from grain wheat right so that's going to be um so if you eat doughnuts and bread and pasta gluten your average to get this big gluten free pay ... a craze right now\nBut it's really it's too much weight um and we have too much wheat in our bodies and then also I'm a by the way this is going to be a good news Josh you appreciate this red meat is actually good for you if it's from a grass fed cow he just said well poop\nUm is is that exactly what she said well we'll just like that was a high high tone of voice that's what I said so actually grass\nFed beef is very anti inflammatory can reverse heart disease and cancer however grain fed beef is very pro inflammatory and causes heart disease and cancer and that's because that cow that each grain is a cow this going to get a lot of omega six\nPro inflammatory fats if that couch each grass it's going to get a lot of omega three anti inflammatory fat so here's a cool thing cows that are grass\nFed have a one disk three omega three to six ratio so they're anti inflammatory cows that eat grain right this is our typical beef in our fast food top grain of beef\nI'm stuff most of what you get a grocery store I'm I'm going to give you some resources for ... beef right here in the grocery store I'm but those are going to have a one two one two you ratio of omega three do make a six which means he's\nGrain fed beef are very pro inflammatory\nCauses heart disease causes cancer I'm just from eating\nThat pro temperature beef it's real simple because those those cows that eat grain or ... how did you eat doughnuts all day long and then when you eat that cows like you're eating the doughnuts so it's going to give you that pro inflammatory fat a side note I'm the average woman with multiple sclerosis has a one to twenty two\nOmega three to make six ratio one to twenty two so that tells you to think about how valuable and foreigners make sure that you're making stories are full so am I going to get into this but I'm also going to give it to of course we're chiropractors um the reason I Do the show there's

whole lifestyle by far in America can yell guess what do you think number one source of information\nOr not grade Joshua Greene he's wrong\nUm and it actually soda but you know that soda is the number one source of sugar in the United states but the worst part about so does not even saying the sugar itself fructose of sorts high fructose corn syrup it's in our sodas\nAnd it'll kill you man it is so deadly for a cause information you're arterial wall um it causes cancer cells as a matter of fact there's eight times as many receptor sites for\nUm sugar on a cancer cell is a regular cell that's why when you go to get a cancer stand on a PET scan what they do is actually inject you with radioactive sugar and that radioactive sugar finds its way to guess what your cancer cells\nAnd then gives off that radiation so they can tell you where the cancer is because cancer loves sugar so obviously you're not only does it cause inflammation it spurs on cancer is not good things that causes information

I Believe\nSo Jim you've got a real big Lafayette accent and I'm just an amazing guy just a great guy hurt us on the radio and Jimmy just he was on blood pressure medication um he wasn't feeling

the whole hour so if you're just tuning in your welcome you're going to get the condensed version\nOf what caused information was what basically the white kills you what causes it how to avoid it and how to remove number one white kills you get heart disease cancer arthritis decrease your immune system you don't want information trust me too much of it what causes it real simple it's and omega three versus omega ... a six shift\nWhich basically means too much omega six so maybe six again is grain and sugar was the big thing at Speicher makes six spike your information grain and sugar I'm also going to put stress in that category um but it's tough to a limited stress it's actually easier to eliminate the ... of the sugar\nI'm so that way when you have stress um it doesn't affect your body so reactive we how do we avoid it real simple\nFish oils coconut ... know veggie oil no peanut oil and no grain fed beef or the grain fed beef or cause heart disease now because of the fat\nNow like the saturated fat causes heart disease because of the inflammatory effect so cows that grain how'd they won two twenty omega six omega three to make a sex ratio is supposed to be one to through your wonder for cows that eat grass how did they wander through your one before\nSo great a grass fed beef is extremely healthy for you\nOn the same omega six ratio\nYou don't have to worry about the saturated fat as a matter of fact that saturated fat your brain needs that saturated fat your hormones you that saturated fat as a matter of fact the old adage that saturated fat is bad for you ... stupid because all of your neurons are made up saturated fat\nI mean God did you see I traded fat because he needs you to eat it and it's in you know a lot of very very healthy food or not grain fed beef will cause heart disease not because of the saturated fat but because of the inflammatory fat of grain fed beef\nSo how do we remove information if you have against fish oil we recommend ...

the other end of the sky box I heard this voice and I said I recognize that voice I walked over it all came up to this guy so that you're talking like as if he doesn't know\nAnd we try we missed the bus to all of the Gulf War the way the quiet signs that are like oh well I Wonder why two guys are probably in trouble for talking all the time a glass back in the day I Know I was on about you just you know I never went to class\nNothing better than self deprecating style that's right\nYeah that's it you're literally you get very large [noise] it's ours are like All right Steve let's talk about brokers behaving badly on every week we have plenty to choose from I mean this isn't your broker right now yeah [noise]\nFinancial news networks present\nIn today's episode we make millions rumor junior and find out why he's now serving ... years in prison in order to pay for a million dollars in two\nYears of issues in Boston help state look to his investors and then started trading options futures and continually lost money during the life is a scam\nAnd in a statement released by Sherry like us attorney to South Carolina she says sadly many positions in this case are elderly and lost all their retirement savings [noise]\nThe U.S attorney's office says rather than report the losses liver is said to his emailed his investors mostly account statement that's also listen to the games of eight to ten percent on an annual ... who is also had manufacturers\nAnd distributors false account statements from the start which you continue to do until the plot twenty ... twenty Seventeen to twenty five people invested ... million with liver and of that he lost his ought to leave\nThe bulk of which came from your clients retirement said [noise]\nJust one more reason to make sure you're dealing with a bunch of sharing\nDon't be afraid to ask them to prove\nWow that sounds like it's a minute he made off because they're already did the phony accounts they oh yeah he was promised any more than that kind of return wasn't it wasn't Fifteen sixteen Seventeen percent returns understatement oh yeah you know I think these guys and I'm not going to a surely not taken up for it but I think they start with a plan saying hey I can do better than anything that's out there right\nBut I Can't tell it to my clients they would say go so let me just help them out and say yes or no effect but and then they start to get them then they lose money and then there goes the cycle\nOh gosh I mean we've got some some brokers bathing battle coming up there's there's one it's a couple yeah they actually met at one place and then they got married and then they scammed everybody else and ... there's a whole nother one to that'll just\nActually I'm an average made in heaven right now they're in jail water ... on the other yeah\nOh they're not to have you know it it is it's it's I don't know it's baffling that people keep doing it they're all over the place it happens every single week we are as you know we have a production meeting every Monday when we're talking about what we're going to talk about the falling weekend Frank and we basically we've had some heated arguments 'cause we're trying to decide which one to ... so many of\nTheir hours [laughter] yeah I Know we've got a bad luck there like a few minutes like O'Hare Airport over the writing was all lined up to go up\nThere so I don't know if it's not going to stop the folks here's one of the takeaways though if you if you have a broker or she goes you're getting statements that email to you know now that said you do is be tougher these days to\nTo see if only statement because he used to be if they if you'd send you something to mail it looked like it was taped on your logo or ... or the crooked print and all that kind of stuff for white out but now when they email stuff I mean how do you know\nHow do you write you know or you know ... with gosh have you tried to log into your account you can't get into Brazil I change your password for you [laughter]\nWhat's that about yeah that's good I Know so be careful who you share your passwords with all that but gosh I mean that that's not going to it's not gonna stop no well\nIt keeps me employed just writing brokers behaving badly [laughter] and there's always a white guy there you go [noise]\n[noise]\nYou're yeah you're right\nThere where Mr Rudy is no today\nMember that there'll be who cannot forget the Rudy chant though all my guy right now so we went to Notre Dame film the documentary because the twenty five year anniversary of the movie Rudy is this year right now and Chuck you remember the movie\nRudy guy who got a little bit of inspiration movie that was save you remember when I was going to show that I I mean if someone came up twenty five years ago I saw it in the theater yeah I mean I mean that was that was how big a deal it was some a lot of women are not familiar with the movie Rudy Mandy so don't feel bad and I am now and I hung up okay Indiana when you know what\nThis and that was amazing to go to games I've never been in ... they had a luckily they had a small airport that except the big plane so we're able to fly right in there almost in order to get ahead of bounce one airport and then\nI think I would've Detroit in a down how badly you want to be an idea and so it was amazing campus so you've never been out of the state of college campuses or that they make you feel like studying for a minute\nFor him [laughter] but it's a movie it was fun to do\nAnd we found that documented Rudy went to all the different places he went in the movie and filmed it and that's coming out were up for three Emmys with this movie now ... which I mean that's pretty remarkable yeah and so it was a fun movie and it's available to see what's going to be talking about I mean if you if you've seen the regular wrote a you want to see this one yeah it's on Amazon Prime just put Rudy the walk on\nAnd it's free on Amazon Prime right now right by the time I Do because they're going to take it back out they're gonna release both of his movies are going to have a twenty five year release coming up for the Rudy moving they're gonna fall with this one and it's gonna cost you money but now when it's free to go to Amazon Prime right now\nWell and again it was so cool to see him you know really in self luck around the Capitol said hey if if it was your favorite what's your favorite sports building and they say Rudy and they don't know that it's\nFunny it is really funny because he's not Sean Ashton the actor obviously the ragweed everybody see Sean asked and they think of what the ... they take the word of the rings\nGetting the the game back but if you have a big game and you haven't liquidated it then you don't really have the game and the ... the money could go back down again right of course it's walking some things in it and making sure that you have what we the the the three most important aspects\nOf a true retirement plan not the financial plan that has like four one K. and\nYou're raising all your stocks bonds mutual funds that go up and down all around what we need to have growth that that is that is sure we need to have growth every year\nThe worst thing that happened is zero it's what we need some day\nYou don't lose money it's a whole lot easier to recover when the market recovers 'cause you didn't lose any way but if everyone else is recovering you're adding to the games\nBut we also need protection we need to protect our money from these taxes and expenses and financial termites we call it\nAnd markets ups and downs all that kinda stuff and it is you're not going to get a protection inside the stock market oh bless you do some very fancy straddling strategies that have a lot of financial termites in their rights when guys recommend that they're making money on that\nAnd you're not going to make a lot about it you're not going to keep yourself out of trouble by going to these classes that I hear on the radio all the time where they're going to try to show you how to invest and you're going to become you quit your job now because they're going to make money market of more down the shore yeah it's a lot easier the day after to say hey the market's going down yesterday [laughter]\nWell it's already today and you're talking about yesterday so you can't there's no magic fix right there in the way things are being sold and these guys are not investment advisors and not even financially license and they're telling you how you can make\nA lot of money play in the market you better be very careful with those guys because they're not going to be around when he was funny and you can't sue somebody who's not licensed\nThe eagle advice when the next door neighbor who's a landscaper and then you say well uh you know I'm In jail because we we live I said well I'm not aware here's what I did say the holiday inn was but I did trigger Hedges yesterday you know but but that's another story it'd be very careful I'm I'm Serious about this because I hear it I listen to the radio by the way you listen to now to me I was in other people\nMyself and I can't believe some of the stuff that you're on the radio is no get rich QUICK scheme out there what does no one is going to work and we hear him\nThey use all the same tactics that the multi level marketing people do do you can leave your job you can get this fancy sports car you'll only worked three hours a week and you make when you're making now see if you've heard him offered I'm sure other jobs do my gosh there's no quick fix like that you may get lucky hey every now and then somebody buys the right lottery ticket\nWhat about all the people who aren't buying the right water you know and so and you know who wins the lottery is they do because they talk to you end up paying ten twenty thirty thousand dollars or more for their software classes right so they're guaranteed return and you're not here to eat anything but losing money okay and that if you're if you're paying money you're losing money if there's fees expenses commissions\nIf someone's not license you should never take advice to them\nHow many times have we done that we'd gone on a on the Internet search engine like Google when we look up advice and we've we start to where we start bleeding some of the things we read but then we don't realize who wrote it right and so I've interviewed with a whole lot of reporters back in the day and even now TV print radio\nAnd what I've come to the ... of his most of them basically just taking what they want a one or two soundbites and they want to make it twist into what the story the right of course it is yeah so when I conceived what I Do now is when I Do any interview I start my tape recorder because I don't want to be misquoted because they can ... by ... by cutting in choosing what they want to be very careful what you believe\nThey should be very careful what you hear a coach me well you're you're on the radio what are you going to do when we back everything up with writing I'm fully license to give the advice I Do but we don't give individual advice on air and she can never take anything here on air as a factor should verify it troubled Ronald Reagan used to say it trust but verify it and\nMake sure that you get on the right path through the financial world and it's not as far as you think I Know we get confused all the information out there gosh those guys who should be talking about just protecting my money these other guys are so you're not going to leave my job but I can make millions just by investing\nStock market and been trading and pressing buttons that's not true\nSteve it's not it's not true I don't know people that have gone there to their to their little that they give a little free stuff was like oh sure way\nBut what they're trying to do is just call it it's almost like a Bates which we give you this little piece of candy get my car and then we'll see what you're still you're thirty thousand dollars worth of stuff Mm no I'm just taking two stories together 'cause mom and dad said never to get it from strangers and then they heard about people that wouldn't end up in a band that they wouldn't come back so that that could happen in your wallet if you're not careful\nThat commercial with the guy just those as well in the in the water he says I don't think I should have done that well you're right probably not the best for your worst enemy many times as yourself because you oversee things or you think things are just too easy whether or not but one of the things that is easy\nIs getting the right way in a place if you are honest with yourself and know that you've built up a gigantic lump sum we call it a financial time bomb because it's a financial plan\nBut we don't have a retirement plan so the main thing that people ask me over and over again is how to turn my will\nInto an income stream coach beat up this lump sum at which seem to Steve in the office of course people with three four five million dollars to the lump sum and they're not happy and they should because

announcement probably I'd ride the national ...\nPlay some video games and they ...\nYou live in a man dreams\nThem and then then then somehow oh how you can\nGo I just don't understand this crazy

sitting up on mascara makes his first court appearance tomorrow I think that's the gators learned more about the ambush authorities\nSay that accused gunman Robert Bowers made anti Semitic comments and was armed with a number of weapons during the attack that killed eleven people inside the tree of life synagogue dishes us attorney Scott Brady\nBowers was armed with multiple weapons he had three block three fifty seven handguns and then they are Fifteen assault rifle\nA well we do is we make sure that uh the clients and organs are using the nutrition that I'm recommending the other thing uh with nutritional response testing is that you're able to find out down to the dosage how much of that nutrition that person needs\nSo when you come to my office we're going to find are exactly what you need we're going to find out exactly what the weakest Glenn Oregon is and they were going to start working on that I call that a phase one once we get to Glen in Oregon to a good a stable point and that will be um probably about four to six weeks\nThen what would do is we will\nBe able to go in and start cleaning systems up now what I mean by systems is systems that excrete things out of the body\nLike your liver the purpose of your liver the main purposes or detoxification there's phase one face to of detoxification that occurs and deliver\nBut most Americans are walking around with a congested liver meaning it's filling up with sludge our liver is working overtime it's never had to handle these many this many uh chemicals\nAre that are on our food and that are in the environment ... you might have heard of life has said glyphosate is found in round up round up is used worldwide and it's a herbicide it kills the metabolism of the plant so it works really really good\nAnd what happens is the uh uh ... said gets onto the food and then we eat it and it gets into us\nAnd if you'd be eat every eating eating any um commercial foods meaning that they're not organic you've got life has said in you and it sticks into the fat each issue of the body\nSo what happens is uh we get filled up with these toxins your liver has to handle that to some degree it has to store it has to get rid of it\nUh and that's just one a chemical that people are taking in on a daily basis and what they found out what life has said is that it stops the absorption of vitamin D and we got a big problem with the people not getting enough item indie they're not absorbing it anymore and in my opinion is due to life uh say too much life has said in there\nSo uh what we'll do is we'll clean up those systems we got to clean up the liberal we got to clean up the intestinal tract we've got to clean up the kidneys the gall bladder\nThose are systems that excrete things out of the body\nNow I can see a lot of people right now they're saying oh I've done the taxes and I felt good for a while and then um I felt bad again well that's true ah what the problem is that you didn't go deep enough to clean up those systems we don't just stop at cleaning up deliver the gall bladder Tesla tracking kidneys\nAnd we can do all kinds of things in those areas we could do to liberate flushes we could do\nA intestinal track cleaning up the intestinal track we can clean up the kidneys we can do kidney detox is what I recommend and again this is through standard process it's a twenty eight day whole body detox that we use that just kind of clean everything up for us\nBut the purpose of the de taxes to open up pathways that is not\nTo necessarily he'll things up we want those pathways open so that we can get to our next level which is actually working on a cellular level and when we work on a cellular level what we're looking for are all these toxins that have built up over your whole lifetime\nAnd believe me ah there's lots of them they estimate that there's two hundred and thirty six different toxins in the average American uh right now\nUh if you went and it had a a tissue checked\nNow you can't check for these toxins by just doing a standard blood test uh the only time that you're gonna find toxins in your bloodstream a on a standard blood test is if you're going to um if you'd be poisoned by it or if you're being poisoned it'll be in the bloodstream otherwise the body's going to handle it to some degree\nAnd the way it handles it is that it embedded in fatty issue like yourselves yourself have a fat each issue they have a double layer a membrane that's what makes up the cell and you've got something like a to point three trillion cells in your body\nBut the all these self have a double layered fatty membrane well what happens is these toxins get embedded into that fat layer\nThat's the way the body handles it is trying to Stuart is trying to get it out of circulation or doesn't want to be in circulation it'd make you sick if all of a sudden all the toxins in your body were released at one time you'd be very very sick if not dead\nUm so what happens is the body will store those an embedded into the fatty tissue around the cell membranes\nWell what else is fat and you're a body is your brain your brain is about sixty to eighty percent fat so as what heavy metals and toxins loved to go into the brain area and uh the the attacks that I used for this is the only one that's been Scientifically Proven to pull heavy metals and chemicals out of the brain\nSo we start cleaning up the systems and now we're down on the cellular level and we want to pull those toxins heavy metals and toxins out of the body\nAnd we start working on that and we start cleaning things up then or if you want to do a call it the force face now we've got to get the body to work even faster and clean a lot of things up\nSo uh what we want to do is we want to um\nLook at your diet obviously now we look at your diet all the way along along the a a time that we are treating you hear a and my office and what we're doing is we're making sure that that diet is in there's one thing that will stop the body from\nHealing and that is sugar sugar and toxins no sugar can be classified as a toxin\nNow there's a rule of thumb that you shouldn't eat more than Seventy five net
