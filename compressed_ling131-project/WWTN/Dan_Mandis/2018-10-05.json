[noise]\nIf you're a woman having a heart attack\nThere's something you need to know about your son to give to CNN chief medical correspondent first of all here in the United states or disease remains the biggest killer of men and women\nHeart attack symptoms of men and women can be very different with symptoms for women sometimes a bit more difficult to recognize\nAccording to the American Heart Association\nWomen's you pay particular attention to shortness of breath\nDropping and nausea\nAnd according to a new study out of the University of Minnesota\nThey should also maybe pay attention to their doctors gender get this women are more likely to survive a heart attack\nWhen they are cared for by a woman doctor\nWho knows it could be that women feel more comfortable speaking up with the woman doctor or it could be that women doctors are more likely to recognize heart attacks symptoms more often experienced by women\nI'm Dr Sanjay Gupta helping you live a better life\nHey this is interesting what you might have on them to tell you about my pod wrap sheet impress each week I'm joined by special that from around the with\nMy careful stopped by pop football and get you inside scoop on the biggest and maybe even a little bit about that if you have a tag in your closet that says structure that things got [laughter]\n... apple pie stitches or your favorite pie kept that from the west would one podcast network\nHenderson bail Nashville\nStudio audience I mean I\nWork for capital more protests today in Washington on the eve of the vote that could confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court problems on\nCan you on the one hand say that\nI support judge Kavanaugh\nBut at the same time called Dr Ford a hero because if you feel like Dr Ford is a hero well then obviously you believe that uh her story regarding judge Kavanaugh and what he did to her\nSo fill you can't have it both ways you simply cannot have this both ways you can see that she's a hero but then support judge Kavanaugh at least in my opinion\nBecause she is far from credible you can't have somebody who you deem as a hero when she has such huge credibility issues now for the record\nDidn't feel like she had to any credibility from the start but then the longer time went on and the more her story fell apart and we absolutely knew\nThat she had no credibility because you know I don't want to go down and regurgitate everything that we've been talking about for the past two weeks but let's just say we all know about the credibility gaps from not even knowing what year was not knowing how she got home that people she said this party were not I mean it goes on and on and we we all know\nOh\nHe says Dr Ford is a hero and has brought forcefully into the national conversation than many barriers women face in reporting and dealing with sexual harassment and assault okay\nApparently is going to be one of these days today where I can read a sentence without commenting on it but I guess is what I Do for a living so whatever [noise]\nSo when he says that she is a hero and has brought forcefully end of the national conversation the many barriers women face in reporting in dealing with sexual harassment and assault\nThose two are are mutually exclusive so for example Dr Ford issue hero no when you talked about her story\nHas she brought into the national conversation to many barriers women face in reporting in dealing with sexual harassment and assault I Would say yes and no because what this truly has done at least for me and maybe you disagree\nBut at least for me what she has really done is bringing into the national conversation men who were falsely accused\nOf sexual assault men who were falsely accused of sexual harassment to me that is what has been thrust into the national conversation because it is because it is clear that Dr Ford has been lying\nEither that or she thinks that she's telling the truth but she's horrifically mistaken\n\nBredesen goes on to say I was disgusted by the treatment she received at the hands of the Senate okay who fell when you talk about how you were disgusted by the treatment that Christine Ford received at the hands of the Senate are you talking about Dianne Feinstein\nWho supposedly leaked that letter to or Ford's attorney or themselves but um you know the the Democrats essentially a leaking her letter to the media\nSo that they could essentially smoker out so that they could continue along with this a narrative about judge Kavanaugh it when you say that you're disgusted fill up by the treatment that she received at the hands of the Senate well I Would ask you a with all due respect to be more specific\nBecause as far as I Know\nThe Republicans treated her like kid gloves I mean they really did was it that wasn't that one of the big issues that are a lot of folks had\nI Know I was a little frustrated with the fact that they're Republicans didn't roll up their sleeves and really ask her some tough questions\nSo when Phil Bredesen running to be your senator when he says that he was disgusted by the treatment she received at the hands of the Senate I think it's awfully convenient that he doesn't specify or name any names\nThe Chuck Grassley Phil who allowed her to come to the Senate Judiciary committee and nationally televised hours and hours of of baseless allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nAre you talking about Chuck Grassley who offered to fly to California so that they could meet with her in private\nSo they shouldn't have to get on an airplane because remember she was terrified to fly right uh so when you say that you're disgusted filled by the treatment that she received at the hands of the Senate it seems to me like the Republicans again handled serve a kid was\nIt also seems to me like it was the Republicans who said okay you know what let's give this an extra week thank you Jeff Flake God I hate saying that\nAnyway breast and goes on to say and uh he says I Am determined to help bring about a fair and far more respectful treatment\nOf these issues so obviously Phil Bredesen is a playing both sides and I I understand that this is a guy who is trying to do whatever he can to play a both sides he's trying to\nMake sure that the Democrats vote for him he's also trying to shave off a bunch of Republicans to vote for him as well if\nThis if this statement by Phil Bredesen does not convince you as a Republican and as a conservative clearly the brightest and is coordinating with Chuck Schumer than I don't know what else\nTo tell you I almost feel like but with all due respect you folks I I feel like you're a lost cause\nIf you're still thinking of voting for a field brightest and this is the party a Chuck Schumer\nThis is the party of the resistance until friday as we all know brightest in had frequently avoided answering the question instead focusing on how Democrats and Republicans have handled the nomination process that remember what I told you a while back member I I said well that's that's what Bredesen is doing\nThis is what his strategy is what brought us and strategy is and we saw this in the first debate with Marsha Blackburn is he is his shtick is I'm going to blame both parties\nIt it's okay to blast the Democrats if I'm also blasting the Republicans but you would think\nThat the threat is in considers a doctor for some sort of a hero that he would call out the Democrats for thrusting her into the spotlight anyway I Love to have this read by the way in the tendency and listen to this\nPractice as decision as a political gamble as he hopes to shore up support from Republican and independent voters in a race that is expected to be close\nWell I I I Do understand that I I don't see how it's a political gamble in the sense that again he's trying to play both sides here but I'm just\nI kind of have to ask the question here again can you can you really say that Dr Ford is a hero while at the same time\nAs saying that you are someone who would support a judge Kavanaugh said to me\nIt doesn't make any sense also happening right now on Capitol Hill\nWe have a whole bunch of protesters and demonstrators we had what some are three hundred or so\nThat people arrested here in the last couple of days and one of the things that that is happening is Hollywood and George Soros and a lot of these other folks are heading out to Washington DC and by the way or elsewhere across America and and yeah they're protesting [laughter]\nYeah so so that's just some of the demonstrators that we've been hearing and by the way there there's pro Kavanaugh and the anti a cabinet demonstrators out there but I I think it's safe to say that there are a lot more a lot more anti a cabin out demonstrators than pro\nSix on five seven three seven W W T and let's say hello to Bob in Henderson villain WGN Bob how are you\nA ... a\nAnybody's paying attention or there's got to know that a doctor forward is nothing but a larger or she made a last I heard over a million dollar but making false accusations and if the if the Republicans don't prosecute people for\nEssentially was conspiracy who I'm a ...\nCourt and they are they broke lots of loans\nAnd so if they don't start putting these people in jail they're going to get a lot more\nA radical and ... and a lot more doing a lot more than just going to baseball building and kill him

see a Sharon but I'm asking how much\nI might go see Ed Sheeran I'm very interested in seeing a chair and but not a fame they're saying while their face value so if you want to go see Ed Sheeran somebody's trying to sell tickets on a on Twitter I I guess they can't make it so\nIf I had that kind of money actually I Do see brutal Mars but uh for me it's a great weekend in Nashville 'cause man I just I don't know about you and you're more of a music driven guy than I Am yes but\nMan you've got Bruno\nMars this weekend you've got a sheer and you've got all kinds of great movies that are coming out there's all kinds of stuff I don't know I knew it\nSure was big but I didn't know he was stadium big yeah oh yeah I had no idea well\nYou need to get with it is what you need to do 'cause I knew that when Ed Sheeran was spotted\nHiking with Taylor Swift here in Nashville awhile ago that's how I knew that I'd Sharon was indeed a stadium big by the way let's get back into the headlines now we do have\nA Chris Coons add a whole bunch of Democrats who are complaining very much about what has been going on in the U.S Senate they are not happy at all that a judge Kavanaugh is going to get his full vote tomorrow here is of course Chris Coons\nI have reached out to all three to senator Collins and Murkowski into Senator Flake I'm\nOK and apparently one of the things that he's saying as my computer just took a crash or if he's trying to convince them to vote no\nI have reached out fan all three to senator Collins and Murkowski senator Senator Flake um and I will make an appeal today for them to consider um my sort of closing arguments but I also know that they are getting um input from absolutely everywhere\nYeah you think [laughter] so he hears this story 'cause I Know that people are constantly tuning in and out the vote for culture and so basically the Senate has now voted to vote tomorrow to make it official and we know that everybody was looking at it just a handful of senators Jeff Flake he he voted yes\nThe question is do we trust Jeff Flake because we know that it took just a couple of screaming George Soros employees in an elevator to get him to change his mind what about a week or so ago and so that's the guy that is obviously a wild card so we'll have to see what happens with Jeff Flake he is coming\nAnd it said that he will indeed a vote yes but we all have to wait and see Lisa Murkowski actually believe it or not voted no I she and the Republicans are trying to save or her seat there in Alaska so this is almost like some political cover some political maneuverings will have to wait and see what happens there\nAs Susan Collins Republican out of Maine she voted yes to send it to the full of Center for tomorrow to uh have the big vote and she will announce at two o'clock hour time\nHow she's going to vote I I find that interesting thing just tell us how you're going to vote\nSo she's getting all kinds of and I think there's probably a lot of drama I think that if she was going to vote no than she would have already gate given a fat indication unless you truly has not decided\nHow she's going to vote and will have to wait and see by the way just because\nThe uh the senators voted to vote tomorrow just because they voted yes to cloture doesn't necessarily mean that they are obligated to vote to confirm a judge Kavanaugh so\nMost people who are far smarter than me and these things are are saying that more than likely the Republicans have the votes by the way Joe mansion Democrat or who is a very much\nI've been in the spotlight and all this he is saying now that I'm\nActually has not come out and said anything regarding how he's going to vote tomorrow but he did vote yes\nAt that the full vote should be held tomorrow so the Republicans essentially loss to Lisa Murkowski as they try to save her seat in Alaska Joe Manchin who was trying to save his seat in West Virginia where President Trump has been very popular a lot of this of course is that political maneuvering\nThe mines can change minds could very much change and so apparently the vote will be quote unquote no sooner than three fifty two pm on Saturday our time when it gets to some of these calls very quickly and let's say hello to Daniel in greenbrier on WGN uh Darryl go ahead Darryl\nYeah my question is is do we know exactly who put this lady up to making these spoke false accusations I mean somebody had to go to her and go hey we need you to say this about ...\n... and and but that I don't think I've heard anybody say anything about that right in\nIn ... I really don't know who initially would have put her up to it we know that uh you know they've had these\nThese stories on Kavanaugh if I remember correctly and this is going back many days now but they've kind of had this and they're back pocket with the cabinet for quite some time now I'm not talking about from the original letter to Dianne Feinstein I'm Talking about this goes back years if I remember correctly and I'm gonna have to\nI'd have to shut my eyes and I'm going to have to remember a story that I covered I mean it was weeks ago where a Mitt Romney was Mitt Romney was running yeah it was Mitt Romney against Obama\nSee this has that the Democrats than in the Clinton a dirty little fingerprints all over the Pfizer warns\nYou know it seems to me that James Khomeini and the FBI the Clintons to Democrats they all conspired to gather\nTo try and hamstring and spy on a candidate Trump and his inner circle testifying before junk they a joint session of the house judiciary and oversight committees Baker said Mr ... against us is the attorney with the Clinton the DNC ties approached him\nAnd again this guy at the time was the top lawyer at the FBI so you've got Clinton approaching the FBI the FBI didn't approach them the Clintons approached the FBI about this and said hey a take a look at all this stuff\nTestifying before a joint session of the house judiciary and oversight committee or Mr Baker said Mr assessment approached him the contact was initiated before the FBI and the Justice Department applied for a foreign intelligence Surveillance Act defies a warrant\nFor the Trump campaign figure Carter Page according to the Daily Caller\nWe also know by the way the James Baker was instrumental in obtaining the warrants for page so obviously this is more evidence that the Clintons and the DNC really were behind the Pfizer warrants going after Carter Page and the Trump campaign\nReportedly Mr Baker told lawmakers it was unusual that he was contacted by Mr assessment and it only happened once after the Daily Caller report surfaced one House Judiciary committee member representative Mark Meadows we all know Mr meadows or North Carolina Republican said Mr Baker's testimony was\nExplosive he says some of the things\nAnd we don't buy what'd you say no you know we don't exactly know what a entail was passed along to the FBI we've spoken often enough about this a collusion with the FBI I mean to me I I put it all together you got collusion\nYou got the FBI you've got a the DNC you've got Hillary you cut the media you've got Hollywood you've got a

whole process\nWell was poisoned from the outset when President Trump's selected judge Kavanaugh from a list of names Korea prove\nBy hard right special interest groups all my lord and the national issue shot up tracking concert compared to repealing roadway cutting people's health care right right and the cheating apart as a majority on the Supreme Court\nI said so that is Chuck Schumer I don't know why it is that he always just sounds like the voice of death but he really does so first of all he would you say they're talking about heart whatever was hard heard right wing activist group to\nGet to the narrative is so phoney and and false first of all we know that uh George Soros and ah and all of his\nAnd all all all of his contractors are out there all across America and certainly in Washington DC is talking about um\nI have it on and getting ready to protests we know that those two women\nWere or employees of of George Soros and they were affiliated with groups that Soros was very heavily funding you know the the two women\nWho were and are considered heroes on the left because they were costing Jeff Flake an elevator we know that those were affiliated with George Soros aligned groups\nSo for ... Schumer to come out and start talking about these you know hard right Republican whatever the hell or was it he's talking about you know it is so transparent here's more of um actually I'm going I'm going to spare you some Chuck Schumer audio let's actually here with us Susan Collins has to say\nThat I Will announce may in pensions son to how to vote later today said\nYeah that that's what I'm I Am curious about why it is that she is deciding now there she is going to\nAnnounce at two o'clock hour time by the way uh let's see if we can figure out I don't know how she's going to going to announce it two o'clock if this is going to be something where she's going to find a microphone into you know in a podium and just start talking\nBy we will try to carry her and now I Know this ...\nThis plan this is all about the publicity yeah he's doing this just simply for the homeless\nGuy so let me ask you your political watcher like I Am so do you do you think um the way that she's going about this which is of announce it at two o'clock you know our time\nAnd in the meantime you'll talk about me all over the\nWorld out here that really right so so my question is based on her actions do you think she's going to vote to support or not support a judge Kavanaugh based on how she's handling this whole situation\nI I think she's going to vote for it and then chastised him in the same breath okay I think she's going to say she's going to vote for it but you know we should have had this that the other blah blah blah\nSo in other words she's going to do like to try to do it filled brightest and you know we talked about this the first hour Phil Bredesen saying that he would support a judge Kavanaugh but then he he purported that Christine Ford was some sort of a a hero for sexual assault victims all across America\nAnd I I Love his entire context because he he has the luxury of being able to say absolutely I Would vote for him a but it's a hypothetical so I can lie and get away with it\nWell yeah 'cause you'll notice in and I talked about this and the first hour for folks who are just joining us um you know he he put in a little little hedging there because he said well I haven't seen all the information but based on what I Do know so\nUh you're absolutely right and let's see what else uh what else we have here as far as a reaction from folks on the left because right now this is what the left is trying to do and and I just um read you the\nThe soundbite from Bob Bob Menendez out there in with a New Mexico riding and he's talking about how this whole thing was just a BS investigation or by the FBI and by the way I think the Chuck Grassley I I think he nails this I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule so I voting\nTo some term judge Kevin or are you all the floor\nNight so Chuck Grassley you know it's interesting I'm I'm getting to know I'm a lot of these names are a lot better than I did before all of this and then I got obviously knew who all of these folks were but you know say for example Lindsey Graham right so there's a lot of conservatives myself included\nWho we didn't necessarily have the highest of opinion of Lindsey Graham a Republican obviously we all know what he did during the\nConfirmation hearing to during the testimony when he had that that very passionate ... view of everything that was going on and so from from Lindsey Graham to some of these other folks were really getting to learn a lot more about\nAh these folks I'm Bobby betray is on the phone it bother you always go first on the list as far as we call the radio station and I'm always glad to a happy along on the radio program Bobby how are ya\nWell I'm doing fine except I'm about my hair out or I had ever elliptical world for forty five years or lower and I've never seen anything like that it it just incredible\nBut what I wanted to comment about what it would not have mattered if President Trump has nominated licking now\nWhen we were in that same thing as much about Trump they did is about ... and the other interesting thing I've found is what you mentioned a what ... and I always say he called it like a cheap seat or [laughter] like\nHe you know when\nJustice Thomas and his well didn't Judge Thomas going back and forth between now one set it off in your mind eagle forum line hallway with\nWhat they do for members to wish

we're so horrifying and eat and where it was all that security\nWhen flake what they call it like he was the I mean where I was just horrified\nBy the ... one of the things that I that I was kind of amusing at this whole thing was going on um\nWas it almost seemed like a set up to me it almost seemed like the whole was staged\nAnd I don't disagree with that and and we can look back and see how that is and successful they had they had it at doing that kind of thing and um I you know ... [noise] I I'm just\nSo much that award my daddy used to use and I'm just like I don't know what the world we got to get an expect now\nWill probably let let me ask you a question 'cause you're you're somebody who is a very famous uh here in Tennessee your well your well I don't know like you know well known for your political activism and these kinds of things and so a very good very good conservative\nAnd and\nSome of these very active so let me ask you because I I was playing around with a sort of asking this question of the audience I'll go and ask interview so we know that at some point in the future we are going to have a president who was a Democrat once again\nThat President will have Supreme Court picks right how do you think are Republicans should treat the process when the tables are turned net given everything we've seen now\nWell I Will tell you that that is an excellent question and I suspect that the Democrats are kicking down now that they ever changing the culture\n[laughter] I Know lots of ads\nFor it but that could very good question and I think people are going to have damaged that I Will tell you someone that uh was it at the ticket in our favorite at not at all in ... when he went off like a rocket candle\nAnd he was talking about the people that he had that it won't be felt they were qualified but after what they've got to get pet or not I don't know I think that's got to be a very interesting question to see how that plays\nOut you know it it's interesting too because you know I'm a conservative your conservative\nAnd there was a part of me and this is my own internal struggle I'll be honest with your body as a as somebody who's a talk show host in a conservative I struggle with a with a lot of things and and how I Want to\nDiscuss the topics that I Do on the radio and so there's a part of me that is I was asking that question of myself I thought do do I want to advocate the Republicans\n... when the tables are reverse it at some point they will do reverse it it may be in in twenty twenty or it may be well beyond that but I Do I Do I Want\nThe Republicans to take the high road and be the better party or do I want the Republicans to be\nAs we easily and low down and dirty as the Democrats have been and that's my own internal struggle\nNow and I and I get that I certainly get that a ... then you sound tired seems like it would take very sweet but I think what people would have to take a step back and understand that they dined at our country and its background and\n\n\nI think mainly because whoever the nominee going to be we've got to remember that that person's going to have a family and reputation right and and to see them to be treated the way they treated us that would be terrible and I and I would hate for anybody to go through that\nAnd actually you have a great point and thank you for the call and thank you for the perspective because you know two wrongs do not make a right\nAnd so for me and I know there's a lot of Republicans are out there who are politicians who are saying\nYou know all their their perspective on this are all over the board but you know some are saying boy you're going to be sorry you treated our guy like this where are our nominee like this because wait till uh you bring a I'm bringing up a person to the Supreme Court and you are your party wants to nominate somebody to the Supreme Court\nBut yeah you know there there is something to be said for being the party that are quite frankly has the the higher standard of character and I said a number of different times I Can't believe\nThat there are ...
