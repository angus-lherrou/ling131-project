going\n\nWhat's interesting is what Rand Paul said yesterday he was just trying to be sensible reminds me a lot of what Donald Trump junior was trying to say in terms of our porous open borders oh yeah a lot of people come in through our borders\nThinking that like ... somebody had to get a bowl of ... and you knew that seven out of ten of those that are fine but three of them were poisoned and you would die instantly what'd you grab a handful and he was a great analogy oh everybody took that as a deplorable thing to say\n\nHe was actually statistically kind when you take into account drug cartels and murderers and taken out human traffickers rapists\nPeople to not only break the law with their first step on soil but with plans to break the law there after not to mention terrorists in the midst of a war that come to score again on enemy soil\nAnd this is very similar to that\nRand Paul is saying listen there's a lot of people out there listening this stuff most people who are not mentally ill most people who are right are able to distinguish between politics and life and death\nDifferences in world views are differences in political views and the sacred is of human life but for every thousand out there that are capable of that there are one or two listening that are not\n\nAnd this game of incitement is getting dangerous and it's going to lead to another act of violence that you and I could debate for an entire show and I've debated with friends texting is it the Rand Paul's is it the Ted Cruz's is it the Lindsey Graham's under the most vulnerable I mean their walk up and just shoot them\n\nI still worry most for the president the United states because I'm a firm believer if you're willing to give your life or another it's hard to stop\n\nThe unfairly put a target right on this president\n\nI also see coming a shock to a lot of these leftist delusional people they think everybody believes like them and they think they have to an art history or violently take their country back\nThere that desperate it's an apocalyptic religion to them\nAnd the twenty sixteen they were told Hillary was going to win in a landslide and because they more honestly just took the world view of the Tennessee enter the world view of MSNBC or CNN they believed it would be so then they were shocked when it was it\nThey didn't know what to do is they blamed it they ...\nThey kicked the screen blamed it on Russia a conspiracy I mean something to happen everybody I Know voted for Hillary\nThey're gonna feel the same way in the mid term when it doesn't happen well they weren't conspiratorial and defiantly obstructive in twenty sixteen might they go violent and twenty Eighteen and one thing is for sure\nWith Eric Holder Eric Holder encouraging them to kick in Hillary encourage them to get even less civil\nLiberties are exactly what they appear to be\nVery dangerous that's our final say or the upkeep video it's I Can't call it a game changer 'cause I think the game was already over but it is a final nail from Phil Bredesen and James O'Keefe will join Dan ... and less than ten minutes from right now at twelve oh six and I'll see in the morning at

videos whether it's the abortion clinics acorn and and trust me this is a this is an audience that his savvy and smart and so I've I've talked about you before and it's a it's great to have you on the program and so uh yeah one of the things that I've noticed about your videos\nIs that in specially with just one as you infiltrate the British and campaign\nThey're just sinking like songbirds when you send somebody in or are they up front and honest about the fact that they're journalist or are they posing as interns how do you gain the trust of the people within these particular within these particular campaigns\nUm that's a good question and I and we get some flak from using covert ailment divide that let me say this\nFor ... and Jean I'm James for the record I actually don't have a problem with what you're doing it's it's undercover journalism so just so we're clear\nThough I really ... but but we always feel ... and and because of your audience is pretty good record breaking therapy ethics rationality\nWe we all got one party ... spoke at ... ... we're in the campaign and they were inside and they don't know they're being recorded but it only got ... and ... and the competition will never\nThe world will never leave a recording device with coming alone I think that crosses an ethical line but they're always speaking with people that they've met recently thirty like you and I was talking to a stranger about what we really believe I'm ... but the truth that\nWe're not we're not in trapping these people were not ... them they're telling us that the damn truth [laughter] so ...\nIf you say well how are you get them to open up well because it's so it's not like they're sharing a deep dark secrets they're sharing the troops that are self evident that they're sharing their hearing things that are that are very apparent they're hearing things that are very true and they're almost obvious\nBut not be enough to break through to her near accent at caltech\nAnd that's why the system is broken because in this case the Democrat to lie to get elected and what we want\nWe want the candidate to be honest we want the candidate to say the same thing happened I think so in this case and only in this case it was actually quite easy for us to play the video it's not like we had to use them ... espionage we had to go into the office for\nA few days and just have conversations that could that be what we did\nOne of those conversations with a guy a field organizer named will Stewart and here's part of that conversation very close\nYou know there's a straight a [noise]\nI mean are the people of Tennessee that ignorance I mean man did that stand out to me and I think that\nThat in at least for me when I heard that I Wish I James O'Keefe that I could say that I was surprised was there anything when you decided to you wanted to infiltrate the campaign that job reticence\nAnd and you came back with a reporter came back with the tape was there anything that surprised you about what you heard and saw\nYeah I think we'll have to work and we had a deal coming up momentarily I I actually confronted will Stewart ah yesterday in Nashville I'm In I'm In Knoxville right now but I I've been a travel up state here and I ... and what surprised me was\nAlways the most can slanted towards comment in this case I think will with being very honest I think he you know you get that people are kind of the er are ignorant\nAnd I'm ... and there was this woman Maria who's a field organizer political game I think that shocked at the journal a that they would they would characterize that it's a it's all just a game\nUm everyone in the office with very far left and and and the heart and soul of the party is a ... you know far left policy agenda\nAnd they all resented the fact that Phil Bredesen how to use this out of life that they all knew that it was already fighting and they all knew that and there's this one moment when will Stewart and got to watch the video if you have in this campaign person for\n'em go rather than actually said weren't what cricket fans will be good could look at it will be a good way to raise his eyes it's almost like you're going to go along with Chuck Schumer don't you worry that that was the debt that really struck\nIt ... it was like you had a bit of a gleaming his I did ... and what can I have watched the video dishes\nAre talking about Joe will stored and by the way you said that he is not actually been been terminated by the British and campaign but I'm going to play in jeans a very quick a use of audio again this is a will stewards are talking about how brightest in secretly hates Donald Trump\nI in my\n\nYou'll see that I was so funny the message you don't talk about the way we're not running in Trump's this or this or even though the whole wide world here in ... I'm\n\nJust as one of those situations that James where are you really exposed the brightest in campaign and so one of the things that I thought was interesting about this was a huge and catch up with this guy will Stewart's outside of the offices of ... and he's got nothing to say right\nYeah he didn't he didn't have anything to say he was actually a nice guy um but he just said I cannot talk to you guys I cannot talk like there's nothing I can say well you've already spoken to the American people you've already you've already told everyone in your office and been quite public about it\nAmongst the campaign and I consider this could be you know I'm an undercover journalist people say well why do you do that because I Believe that trend parents he particularly in\nIn in our congressional elections is essential I don't think this is the left or right issue I Would say that I'm a right wing activist I don't I don't think that videotape has an ideological agenda it can an animate object it just showed people talking I don't think at\nThat I don't I don't advocate the lobby I I had an express my opinion about this race on this phone call you right now the one I conducted will to do it yesterday that he is and I go up momentarily\nAnd he said I Can't talk to you about that and I said well we'll you've already talked about it give us give us some understanding and how the system work now you said that they haven't fired we'll see where we don't know what they've done with welfare word I can tell you that some local airport I'm sure thing at my Twitter feed right now\nUh are starting to ask the campaign for comment his starting to happen yes so it'll be very interesting to see what\nThe campaign does and what Phil Bredesen does in reaction to these videos\nAnd James will keep joining us from project very tough talking about he is I Would say blockbuster video certainly sort of people here in Tennessee\nUh confirming what a lot of people a suspected which was that\nStill brightest and when he threw his support behind a Brett Kavanaugh he he's not necessarily being a very truthful and and now so brightest in himself has not been caught on tape but I certainly the people who worked for his campaign have all been caught on tape saying the yeah centrally or we do have a situation where Bredesen\nOr secretly would admit that he hates President Trump and that he would not support jak Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court however I have to lie to the people in Tennessee in order to get elected so I Would say the least in this particular case I most certainly you have uncovered the truth\nWould you say that most of your videos and again I'm I'm familiar with with a good number of your videos and and so I Would say this\nIs that your videos they really do I wouldn't say that they're part isn't by any stretch of imagination you weren't just somebody you seem to be at least for me on the side of wanting to find out the truth some people don't James haves and have accused you of selectively editing in these kinds of things\nI looked at just this video on ... and I don't see where that accusation could be made a year\nOr there's no there's no collective editing that that'd be a first of all I'll tell you what what is it for like ... and you think secondhand on uncorroborated unsubstantiated threats quote relaying information from other sorts quote like in Bob Woodward's book\nWhen I was going to get your in laws I mean like ... like most of the media does today\nYeah with most of the media does it or why you know\nI picked such a sense that people are packing me I I don't report anything you can get physically coming out of their mouth I mean we that isn't closer to journalism to what the media does that leave their the older in it in your window\nIn uncorroborated allegations and even the stuff that they put it in the newspapers\nAnd the tennis fan or or the Washington Post or anywhere they could quote or not um it's worth it you can't even people who do you nominate authorities are you don't know what their motivations are\nYou don't know if their political offered you don't know if the quote accurately reflect what they said\nIn Bob Woodward a case that's the guy who wrote the you know obviously the Watergate journalist and he wrote the recent book and Donald Trump quote poetic license

guy the male voices a person by the name of James Miller\nWho works for the brightest in campaign and he's talking about the the shock that a lot of folks on the left have about brightest and support for supposedly support for Brett Kavanaugh and the conversation is all about how it's too bad the brightest and has to lie to get that vote listen\nI think it's important to the semi ... call us at ...\n[laughter] I hate the why\n[laughter]\nReality yeah he's talking about how to listen to this is the reality this is what this is what Democrats have to do\nTo get elected is they're lying they're lying to you Tennessee\nAnd here that seem reporter by the way it is talking to a field organizer ... organizer a with a British and campaign and it's the same thing why did reticent say that he would vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh\nWhat if any of his [noise]\nHis religious thing [noise] [noise]\nYeah and so you just heard that and I know it's tough to here particularly probably on the radio but I Do want to make sure that I'm I'm playing for your the audio clip so that you can hear it for yourself\nBecause it's one thing for me to say it but it's a whole nother thing for you to hear it a straight from the tape and again you can see it on the getting men to show Facebook page and if you couldn't pick up all of the audio\nBasically what was happening is the reporter was saying that OK well the the polling apparently was down at the time and by about a point to half a point to a point and so you have the field organizer and saying yeah with those polls are showing that we're down\nThan reticent had to come out and said that he would support a judge Kavanaugh to appeal to the moderate Republicans\nIt's not about the truth friends it's about winning elections and I know that a lot of people like to talk about how good of a guy Phil Bredesen is and and he's just a a good old boy tendency a guy and all this kinda stuff of folks he has a politician through and through\nAnd you know we know\nWe know the kind of guy that Chuck Schumer is\nWe know the kind of person then Maxine Waters is we know the kind of person that Eric Holder is we know the kind of person that Nancy Pelosi is\nWe're now getting to know the real Phil Bredesen at least from the words of his ... campaign folks that doesn't work on his campaign now one of my big questions is has Phil Bredesen a commented on this project ... tape I hadn't ... go ahead no\nSo brightest and has no comment as of yet\nThere's been no comment there's been no statement there's been no tweet there's been nothing like that and here's the other thing that I find interesting Dan ... and and Ken and I talked about this and I just in the hallways here the newsroom\nAlthough we're all over this project fair toss information right can't find any other media organization at\nLike your TV stations right the Tennessee in right in Nashville Scene that Knoxville paper than men Memphis paper the Chattanooga paper so even though we're looking at this and saying oh well see this is exactly what we had known all along the question is how many moderate Republicans\nIn other parts of the state no this is even out\nThey aren't they I think one of the problems is and I'd be interested to know your opinion on his family or they would have problems is that the media doesn't know what to do with a guy like James O'Keefe ah website like project very tossed in other words do you do source\nProject very toss do do you have to ... ... what I'm saying is that would mean that the media would have to admit that they themselves have not been doing the investigative work that genes will kill me doing well you can also tell me if I could maybe they have they feel like he has no credibility\nWell well I Know you say that that ... most unless you're doing an investigative report your Phil Williams of the world and Nancy Amundsen Jeremy family they all do fantastic undercover\nWork and I don't know that they would have thought to have gone\nUndercover you know for the British and campaign you know what I mean I don't know that that would have been on their investigative radar and here's what I don't know that they have to admit that it's just that's not that's not exactly what they do\nBut when it is out there and and as far as credibility goes I don't know that there's anything that's not very credible about\nJames O'Keefe I think that they probably\nAt the the news organization that relief to sort of Breitbart and so I think they may look at Breitbart and I was probably being not as credible or very biased and so maybe they don't want to go there but you don't have to eat and just go straight to project ... and their website there YouTube page and find the audio yourself\nYeah one of the things that I also would find interesting you say to you don't know if they would even know to try to infiltrate the brightest in campaign it's interesting because one of the questions that I asked a James O'Keefe when he was on in the first hour and I'm gonna replay it and the third our\nWas okay so what made you want to infiltrate the brightest in campaign and I can't remember his exact answer but\nYou know he it seems like he kind of he knew what we all news talk show host\nThat it is inconceivable that uh brightest in was so openly my opinion are lying about whether or not he would ... a judge Kavanaugh and\nWe also know that the Democrats from top to bottom they have been willing to and will say anything yet that get it yeah ... yeah so I Would say that for a guy like James O'Keefe or for\nLet's say for example a talk radio there is just this underlying conversation and this underlying narrative\nThat is happening online and on TALK radio that the rest of the media just don't cover and I don't know if it's because they feel like it's competition or they just don't believe in talking about the truth or opinions that are contrary to some of theirs I really don't know\n... that's a very good question but what what is a dangerous I guess if if you're looking at the balance of power in Washington\nThan the moderate Democrats or the moderate Republicans just your moderates yeah may not be hearing misinformation and this will be information that they need to know is Marsha Blackburn is not taking this audio right now and putting it in her campaign ads\nShe is crazy that may be the only way you're moderates your middle of the people are even going to hear it\nYeah that's absolutely right uh let's see let's play another sound sound bite from this I Want to get through all this before the break so then this investigative reporter for a James O'Keefe\nAh project ... talk to a field organizer this guy's name is a will steward also by the way of hamlet O'Keefe it also mentioned that they had another video that was expected out featuring apparently this guy will Stewart\nBecause there was a confrontation\nAt the at the at the debate last night in Knoxville and so ... between James O'Keefe and the people from the brightest in campaign so that video\nIs coming out it momentarily if not to could already be so if you would uh keep an eye out for that but this is this is um will Stewart and he is talking about are the brightest and campaign\n\nSo there's a street [noise]\nAre the people of Tennessee that ignorance that is what the Phil

executing Edmunds Gore ski by lethal injection that means that the execution goes\nForward is scheduled this evening he would die by electric chair which is what is attorney said he wanted to do in the first place it is unclear at this point at the execution ... if the execution will take place a temporary stay has been issued\nFor other reasons but every county can breathe a little easier now that the sheriff's office confirms Wayne had Baker and Jonathan Baxter the two that escaped from jail are now in custody\nWith project Vera toss was the fact that Phil ... has not been honest with Tennessee and he's essentially saying whatever he needs to say to get elected than when he goes to Washington DC guess what's going to happen\nIs going to vote lock step with Chuck Schumer\nAnd so why James O'Keefe wanted to know is was Phil Bredesen was he really being genuine when he said that he would support judge Brett Kavanaugh\nWill it turns out in the conversations with people that work on his campaign is no he was actually lying to Tennessee and when he said that he would support judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court the reason why he's lying is because he needs to find more moderate Republicans to come to his ...\nAnd painted support his his quest to replace Bob Corker so that is the backdrop and this is my conversation earlier with James O'Keefe\n[laughter]\nAnd uh what after all that do you joined us to see\nThe kid that The Revenge is Tania how did you did this was this was a campaign that you wanted to infiltrate\nWell good question for those who are not familiar with that and I hope that you're all familiar with the video by now showing president staffer thing but they're they're basically lying to get elected here we how do we choose it sometime in the campaigns truth ah you know we go with ...\nAnd when it comes to you know fraud and politicians lying\nThe swing state these these these read red state Democrats if you will like Tennessee is one of them I'm going to lie to get elected it's it's it is the truth is probably something that you all for expected that haven't been able to confirm\nSo we go with this story as we go we this is not the only state that we have this where the current ... on tape saying\nYou know I I have to ... or ... staffers are things are so ... in the swing states there is a political dynamic where\nThey have to mislead conservative voter but in their part they're not actually going to do those things once elected that with all the staff because they're on tape saying I just completed they'll president in the city by all your Stafford dial the truth\nBecause they are telling the truth and that's what's so extraordinary about the undercover videos properties people or villain it's that that they're sort of on waiting with ...\nYeah and it is interesting too because I've seen a lot of your videos whether it's the abortion clinics acorn and and trust me this is a this is an audience to shabby and smart and so I've I've talked about you before and it's it's great to have you on the program and so and yeah one of the things that I've noticed about your videos\nIs adding specially with just one as you infiltrate the British and campaigns and they're just singing like songbirds when you send somebody in\nOr are they up front and honest about the fact that you're a journalist or are they posing as interns how do you gain the trust of the people within these particular within these particular campaigns\n[noise] um you get the good question and I and we get some flak from using covert filming devices but let me say this\nFor ... and ... and James for the record I actually don't have a problem with what you're doing it it's undercover journalism so just so we're clear\nThough I asked the lowly but but but we always feel ... and and because your audience is is pretty sophisticated let me break the break this down the ethics of this and the and the rationality [noise]\nWe we always got one party president the conversation for these folks at a ... we're in the campaign and they were inside and they don't know they're being recorded but if there was always at least one person present on the conversation will never buckle room or Beverly recording device with coming alone I think that Crawford unethical line but they're always\nSpeaking with people that they've met recently so it'd be like you and I was talking to a stranger about what we really\nBelieve I'm ... but the trigger we're not we're not in trapping these people were not manipulating them they're telling us yeah the the damn truth [laughter] so\n... you you say well how are you get them to open up well because it's so it's not like they're they're sharing a deep dark secrets they're sharing the troops that are self evident that they're sharing their hearing things that are that are very apparent they're hearing things that are very true and they're almost obvious\nBut not be enough to break through to her near accent it politics and that's why the system is broken because in this case the Democrat lie to get elected and what we want\nWe want the candidate to be honest we want the candidate to say the same thing as perfect so in this case and only in this case it was actually quite easy for us to play in the video it's not like we had to use some sophisticated espionage we have to go into the office for\nA few days and just have conversations ... exactly what we did\nOne of those conversations with a guy a field organizer named will stewards and here's part of that conversation very close\nKnow there's a straight a [noise]\nI mean are the people of Tennessee that ignorance I mean man did that stand out to me and I think that that in at least for me when I heard that I Wish uh James O'Keefe that I Would say that I was surprised was there any saying when you decided to you wanted to infiltrate the campaign so brightest in\n... and you came back with your reporter came back with the tape was there anything that surprised you about what you heard and saw\nYeah I think we'll Stewart and we ... coming up momentarily I I actually confronted will Stewart ah yesterday in Nashville I'm In I'm In Knoxville right now but I I Would travel throughout the state here and I ... and what surprised me was\nAlways the most inflammatory comments in this case I think will is being very honest I think he you know you get that people of Tennessee are are ignorant\nAnd I'm ... and there was this woman Maria who's the field organizer said at the political game I think that shocked that for her in a way that they would they would characterize that we could all just a game\nUm everyone in the office with very far left and and and the heart and soul of the parties erupted her father in law you know far less policy agenda\nAnd they all resented the fact that still better than how to use the author of life that they all knew that it was already size and they all knew that and there's this one moment when will Stewart and got to watch the video if you have in this this campaign person for\nUm reticent actually said well what cricket said he'll be good ... he'll be a good Democrat yeah and it's the way the fact that he's I almost like you're going to go along with Chuck Schumer don't you worry that that was the debt that really struck\nIt ... it was made you had a bit of a gleaming his I didn't eat and what can I have watched the video this is talking about will stored and by the way you said that he is not actually been been terminated by the British and campaign but I'm going to play the genes are very quick a piece of audio again this is a will stewards are talking about how bright isn't secretly hates Donald Trump\nI model [noise]\n[laughter]\nYou'll see that I also hear the messages like don't talk about the way we're not running from St Louis or this or even the whole wide world here you can sell some of my um yeah\nSo\nThis is one of those situations I James where are you really exposed the brightest in campaign and so one of the things that I saw was interesting\nAbout this was the use and catch up with
