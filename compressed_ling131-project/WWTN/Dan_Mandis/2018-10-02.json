Camry county about an hour west of Nashville, Tennessee highway patrol lieutenant Bill Miller morning anyone in the area who may come in contact with Kirby while as you know\nThen it seems like the answer to that question as to whether or not this will affect the mid term elections also changes because as the stories of the Democrats continue to fall apart it makes the Republicans look I Would say a lot better\n[noise] we took this very question into the studio at the public square is a team this weekend and we were checking on key states that we're all in with voters and and and basically trying to get ... or ... street\nAnd everyone agreed that it is a strange eerie feeling that feels like a repeat of two thousand sixteen whether we're talking Tennessee or Florida or Ohio Pennsylvania North Carolina\nThere's a sense that people aren't talking about who they're going to vote for Oh yes\nYou've got the fringe ... up by partisans on both sides with their yard signs up but most people aren't saying anything in fact one of our guys said the biggest sign I see in this swing county the sign I see the most of the swing county in Ohio\nIsn't for any candidate a sign of the more than everything else has help wanted\n... that's exactly right and one of the things to since we're talking about twenty sixteen do you remember David none of the you and I spoke about this uh quite a bit way back then was all the outrage regarding the pie tape we remember all of that well there seems to be equal outrage over all of this with Brett Kavanaugh\nThen of course we all know what happened to President Trump ultimately won the election\nYou think all of this this what I Would say would be manufactured political outrage on the side of the left or do you think that this is really affecting the electorate\nWell it is the message gets out the answer is yes the longer this goes on the worst I think it's getting for Democrats\nDan because there's evidence that yet to come out can I just give you a piece of evidence that it\nLet me tell you something we did some research on this let me read you a direct quote and then I'll tell you where it came from the affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court didn't happen the way I said it pure and simple I lied\nSarah Weddington and Linda Coffee needed an extreme case to make their client look pity of all\nRapes seemed to be the ticket what made rape even worse a gang rape it all started out as a little lie but my little white grew and became more horrible with each telling and quote now who said that everyone in currently thinks the Kevin I'm hearing you know\nThat's the words of the late ...\nThat gene row of the roe versus Wade decision she lied to the court about her case and the circumstances of her case with the help of lawyers and people associated with Planned Parenthood and the ACLU\nThis is not the first time someone's going to the Senate or to the Supreme Court and told her truth but her truth was ally\nSo and I guess now the question is is we know that the uh the Senate is going to vote on Brett Kavanaugh if you listen to and you believe what's going to happen that the words of Mitch McConnell here and the next several days\nOne of the things that's been bandied about over the past week or so you and I may or may not have spoken about this I'm not sure but we we've got to the Democrats in the house now are saying also that they will I started to carry out some sort of an impeachment hearing if Kavanaugh is able to be confirmed later this week\nThat's going to be my next question is and I said this a number of different times\nIf you are not concerned about a Democrat or the Democrats controlling the Senate and controlling the house of representatives\nThis should be your inspiration be Andrew motivation to get out in the mid term election because of the fact that they are looking to do whatever they can to undo what President Trump does and that is certainly the case with Brett Kavanaugh and also of course we know that they'll probably when they're trying to impeach President Trump is well we'll have to wait and see what happens but\nThat's going to be the next question is OK so\nHave we ever seen a case of David ... and you're much more of a pseudonym history than I Am where there have been impeachment proceedings against somebody who is on the Supreme Court\n[noise] uh no uh well actually we did have a one a case of impeachment with Shen will chase and I can't remember the year of that but none other since there have been other members of the federal bench that happened to teach\nAnd removed from office you remember the house to the impeachment than the Senate does the actual trial which is why by the way the end when they said last week but this is a job interview not a trial that was really lying\nBecause the constitution gives the Senate and only the Senate the ability to try and fire every article three judge or justice in the federal system and Kevin ... is already a lifetime appointee in that system obligated to hold that job only on based on good behavior so he was standing before\nThe judges of his career\nAnd if that's not a trial I don't know what is everything that was said could be used against him in an impeachment proceeding\nSo um but so it's very very rare uh but I I wouldn't understand and I we were the first people that said if you're going to hold the standard in and then let's impeach Kevin because he's already a federal judge if he's lying and you have judges lying but I'll tell you what if we're going to do that the cabinet let's do it\nSo that every one of the three thousand plus article three judges has to face the same standard if we have the same standard for everybody\nWe get rid of every person on the court who's ever told a lie well okay I don't know who's going to be left I guess we got a lot of home schoolers are going to be left to be federal judges\nYou know one of the interesting things uh David we talked about this yesterday here on the show senator Coons in like a bolt for asked okay so if Kavanaugh lied to the Senate Judiciary committee then should that\nBe disqualifying is he is making his way trying to be confirmed onto the Supreme Court both of them are you a job interview I'm Sorry I'm On the line\nBut think about that so it it seems to me like they're going through any possible scenario to disqualify him so if it has nothing to do with these past allegations then if they can somehow make up a way that they can accuse him of lying to the Senate Judiciary committee that also\nIs a disqualifying factor so it just seems like the more that their story falls apart the more they're looking at new and creative ways to try and disqualify him is he just me or do you see that too\nYou're exactly right then and that's where the boomerang comes you know we looked at that Senate panel at the end of friday afternoon and it dawned on me that the French Revolution finally reached America\nYou have no concept of objective truth all that matters is opinions in power and if if the cool kids and the powerful people don't like it off with your head yeah I mean we we've seen this in history before is this where we're going back when we throw out the principals rule of law corroborating and it's a a a evidence\nThe presumption of innocence and they get issue goes on in our constitutional procedures to this is much bigger\nThan Kavanaugh as your as your questions clearly indicate it's much bigger than capital it's much bigger than the court it's even bigger than the elections it's about how are we going to governor cells and as the new mop going to take control and that's what the election's going to be about the new mop\nWhat does things also I find you ride a mob mentality absolutely one of the things I find interesting is the fact that you've got people like Cory Booker and eighty so you know Spartacus he he's so sanctimonious and he talks about how you know cabin all lying to the court and all these other things\nAre lying to the committee and all these other things but you know Booker himself lied when he had that Spartacus moment talking about how he was going to release these emails and he's going to break Senate protocol in the rules and all these other things and it turns out he was lying to not only the ... the American people but also the other folks on the committee I guess\nBecause he said that he was going to break protocol and release these old emails when he actually already had permission to release those emails and so if we're going to start you know talking about these various politicians and lying will good lord did not aligned them all up because they're all on the line\nAnd we can go to the question of sexual misconduct\nAlways worry Booker sure you you could he\nHe's already on the record and and and of course he claims that it's okay not because he's changed his thinking about all of this yeah I got to tell you the and the\nUnequal standard this is really the selection was going to be a test on how well people got this message saw this for what it was and whether they want to continue to empower people that are taking us back toward the French Revolution as opposed to back to constitutional government\nAnd I think if the case has made in the electorate in that basis I think you'll see that what the Democrats have done my surprise them to be quite a boomerang\nYeah it may be backfiring last question here David new can answer quickly I if there is a way to answer this quickly talking yesterday about how these two women who are confronted Jeff Flake in the elevator Maria Gallagher and Ana Marie are chilling\nHurley both of these women are affiliated with a group so very much funded by George Soros\nSo I guess my question to you as you were talking when we first started this conversation about how somebody seems to be pulling the strings from behind\nA possible to you know I think that's obviously George Soros\nSources very much in play we've been tracking his millions of dollars going into a ballot issue of all things in Ohio on on drug sentencing reforms and this was before this whole thing with Kevin to blow up sources and play in many places as ... as well\nAnd Facebook yes there are definitely people who wants to revise our form of government who are in play in this election and they're sending their systems in empowered to try to disrupt that doesn't\nMiddle All right David that you're going to be there tonight and I'm I'm actually right\nInformation

Wilson censure\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nHi dad thanks for taking my call yeah I just wanted to comment about the whole congresses and has to do that happened and you know the truth is that many many women have the Syrian credit card of sexual assault in our lifetime I have many women have\nThat doesn't make it any less traumatic but our women who are coming out and supporting critical accord with Ruben during her jak their own negative experience on the judge have now and what that really does it just perpetuate the cycle of victimization\nThey're just looking for a sacrificial lamb and it's not going to an end of their own that experience at all it's you're going to make another that I'm Out of judge Kavanaugh on it's just really really sad\nAnd what's really sad to Julie ... think about it this way is you're right if these women have been sexually assaulted if they've been sexually abused or whatever\nI happen to them ultimately if they haven't come forward and named their own accuser is the the their own assault or their own attacker will then they're projecting that against judge Kavanaugh and in a way against President Trump as well you could argue you could say\nBy not naming their accuser assuming they have proof and assuming they have witnesses and all these other things when they are allowing their accuser to get away with whatever happened to them many years ago so\nI agree with um Kellyanne Conway who over the weekend one she said that she herself was a victim of a sexual assault if I'm not mistaken but she also said\n... if you've got to a situation that happened to you well then please go deal with your accuser go go speak to your accuser go to the police do whatever it is that you need to do\nBut don't project against judge Kavanaugh because he is not the person that did this to you even the woman who was screaming into Jeff Flake the other day and that elevator she was she was screaming about this attack that supposedly happened to her by the way when she was five years old\nAnd so that that whole story I think is really interesting one maybe I'll get into it at some point\nHere today but you know you got all these women that as you said a lot of other folks who said ... yeah you are you're you're projecting your anger towards judge Kavanaugh and that is misplaced direct your anger towards the person that attacked you now teenagers in Nashville and is on WGN ... go ahead\n[noise] [noise] I don't think either taking my call a couple of points out wanting to hopefully create a Kate is looking at the last caller oil and in Texas I'm In regard to her experience than\nWhat she went through or within her out or right I think we're at a time where women it ...\nIt out people need to take responsibility for their act it take to people like it takes two people to make choices and every choice that they had the courage to quit until you choose to go out and drink and yet\nIntoxicated we know that are ... are you know um\nDifferent when we're in the ... we may not make it if we hadn't had been drinking and I ... I Know me I Want to say I don't support\nOr go to Haiti or men or women ... anybody that has been it as a victim I I ... it never happened never take place right I'm In a central city or the workplace or or so forth\nBut I think it's kind of women take responsibility for their at\nI mean I Would never ever get in a car with someone that I did not know\nAnd expect them to take a whole or allow them in our home and what I get into that I think those are that's crossing the line and she\nVery well aware of what happened because she was able to communicate what happened though I'm not sure where the line is where you know make the decision to say\nThat they need to bring in the home and close the door and make sure that they're out of the house I didn't get pregnant women what they are doing and it's a way that they are allowing I think ... is\nI'm going to affect women in the workplace of what's going on with the story yet or ... or you're going to be\nYou know concerned about hiring limit in the workplace um\nWhat kind of things are going to go on and or late in corporate America and the situation because of what's happening in believing people that they're ... the story\nThat where you are ... and can you bring up a great point couple of things uh first of all in case you're just joining us we had a caller liberal Tracy out their ... who\nI talked about how ... years ago she got a blistering Lee drunk guy also apparently got drunk and they made their way back to her house she let her in God or in bed and then before she knew what he re entered the house and he was on top of her\nAnd so one of the things that I said was well that is horrible and he shouldn't have done that but you also got to think about your own behavior and about how you\nYourself admitted that you've got blistering we drunk and I've said this to my kids I tried to live my life in this way and that is that\nWe can behave in in certain ways where we're in a position to succeed we're in a position to be safe we're in a position to make the right decisions rent a position to make the right choices and so if you are somebody who gets just blistering Lee drunk\nThen you're putting yourself\nIn a position of danger you are putting yourself as Tina said you're putting yourself in a position where you are not going to be able to make the right choices and do you are putting yourself in a situation where you are\nIn danger of being assaulted of being kidnapped of not being able to make the right decisions and so while you can say well I was really drunk at the time yeah but you made the choice\nYou made the choice to get really drunk knowing that what that does is that that lowers your inhibitions and affects your ability to make the right decision\nTo Gina has to say a double agent ... go ahead\n[noise] hey I was just court guard called about being attached to her home\nYou know about the difference between heard Dr Ford is that she remembered exactly how she got there she remembered harming people were there she remembered her home in every detail about what happened you know during that time were breath don't like\nIt could be a very different between her story a doctor for it because she couldn't remember your life and then on another subject a Dr Ford has two boys Scottish she can stand on it and later in life somebody accuses her\nIs just because his or her son silken right I mean liberal maybe think about fat you know they all had her some girl just walk away from it there is he automatically guilty\nAnd I appreciate the call Janet very much and that is the that is the situation where and find ourselves in today\nIs one we are all now at risk of these kinds of accusations and allegations and if the Democrats and this is this the tie a societal thing this is a culture thing\nSo in other words if\nThe Democrats are able to keep a Brent Kavanaugh off of the Supreme Court\nWill then where does it end because clearly now this is a way for you know I'm not seeing is just going to be a woman accusing him ... men can do the same thing to women too\nBut this is a situation where these kinds of allegations can be brought up against you and can absolutely do well not only your career but your entire life\nAnd that's the problem is again Trump was talking about how it's a scary time for a young men I Would say that's true but you know the more than I think about what the president and also Donald Trump junior said I Want you to think about this because both\nA senior and junior Trump's both talked about the dangers of being a young man these days\nI understand that but I Would also say that for a lot of men my age which is fifty an up a lot of men my age a lot of the\nLot of the crazy times that we had were in our twenties worth thirty plus years ago for a lot of young men these days frankly you know what they're getting a pretty good education\nIf you think about a young man right now are getting a really good education on what can happen to you based on your behavior now even Thirty years down the road\nBut even that doesn't matter because yes judge Kavanaugh denied a position on the Supreme Court based on a ledge behavior did frankly it doesn't matter how you behave over this space\nHave your lifetime because if somebody can come up and for political reasons just level these kinds of accusations and accusations that are not corroborated and are full of holes and it doesn't really matter how you behave through the course of your lifetime because your life can be and your career\nCan be derailed simply because of an accusation and political correctness and that's the problem we face here in America today\nIf you need bedroom furniture living room furniture you name it they've got it for any

and\nMost certainly noticed the hypocrisy of the Democrats especially when it comes to Minnesota representative Keith Ellison now we know\nThat an ex girlfriend of his there's all these allegations that have been swirling about regarding some apparent alleged abuse at the hands of Keith Ellison towards this particular woman so the question is\nHow the Democrats really responded to this woman\nWho is making all of these accusations so\nThere is a her name is Karen Monaghan and Shia legend back in August a legend in August that the Democratic congressmen dragged her off of a bad by her feed while screaming obscenities at her and twenty sixteen now Alison also lead deputy chairman of the DNC\nHas denied the accusation so Monaghan has been saying all along that she has a video of this whole thing but for whatever reason she refuses to a relief said video so all of that being said the Democrats have done a some investigation and\nUltimately I I Believe they are going to walk away from her accusations because she won't release the video but that's beside the point\nListen to the attorney for\nThe Democrats and then you can apply it to what we're seeing in the whole judge Brett Kavanaugh situation the important part of this story isn't Keith Ellison we we all know about that and we all know about the hypocrisy from the Democrats but this just punctuate that whole narratives\nHere's what the attorney says the lawyer for the DNC\nAn allegation Standing Alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that conduct occurred\nEarly\nSo that's what they're saying about Keith Ellison but boy couldn't you also apply that to Brett Kavanaugh yes of course you could\nAgain and allegations Standing Alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that conduct occurred particularly worthy accusing party declines to produce supporting evidence that she herself\nYou know hidden under his road somewhere right I don't think he I don't think anybody's ever

clients will walk straight into what is in effect the office but not walk into said the ... of their living room\nAnd when she started talking about the second front door and that's the first thing that I thought of but again there were so many other holes in her story that I really didn't give this much thought it just didn't make any sense to me but as we all know out of this story\nSo real clear politics continues to say that may answer another strange anomaly\nBecause since Nineteen Ninety three and through some listings even today\nThere was another tenant who is now at the Ford property it's listed as this person's residents from Ninety three to July of two thousand seven a week or so after she sold the house to to Ford's\nHer name is Dr Sylvia Randall and she's listed the address for her California ... license practice of psychotherapy including couples psychotherapy and tell her move to Oregon in two thousand seven\nSo this woman lived at the home from Ninety three to two thousand seven then apparently she sold the home to the Fords\nHer name again is Dr Sylvia Randall and she does list this as her a California license practice of psychotherapy including ... a psychotherapy\nAnd tell her move to Oregon in two thousand seven in other words it seems likely that yeah this this may have been used as an office as as I psychologist officer is some sort of a therapist's office\nBut most certainly not to be used as some sort of an answer to Dr forwards claustrophobia again it all comes down to credibility so here we are with yet another bizarre twist in this already bizarre story so she doesn't know how she got home\nI she was a you know she had had a lot to drink but you only had one beer she comes up and she says hello to uh you know one of her or one of her assault there is as he is at work at a grocery store I mean we've talked about all of the things we've got all these people\nThat you said with the party that said that they were not at the party so you could just add this to the list of things that simply don't add up\nMany existing director is by the way still have Dr Randall address lifted and what is now the force residents which has real clear politics continues to ask questions which raises other questions why is Christine forward never said a word about Dr Randall\nAnd why is she been invasive about the transcripts of her crucial\nTwenty twelve therapy session which you can't seem to recall much about either ditch you provide them to the Washington Post war did she just provide the therapist summary and who was that psychologist could her psychologist be Dr Randall\nThe very big question Dr Sylvia Randall in a phone call the reporter here at Thomas Lipscomb in a phone call he says I asked Dr Randall if she had sold her house to the Fords she asked back how I had found out\nHe goes on to say and do you relate to this conversation I asked if she was the couples therapist you treated the Fords she would not answer yes or no simply replying I Am a couple of therapist so here's the question very well put by a Thomas Lipscomb\nWas the second door an escape for Christine Blasey Ford's terrors\nWhich still makes no sense to me but whatever\nOr was documenting her tears a ruse for sneaking a rental units through tough local zoning ordinances ended the second door allows access for the tenant of a second housing unit rather than for the primary resident how did the doors existence\nAmeliorate for its professed claustrophobia the very big question so we'll have to see what happened how does he wrap this up\nHe says none of this means that her charges against Kavanaugh might not be perfectly valid but her explanation for the second door and looks like it could use more investigation at the very least it appears to be far more complicated element of force credibility than it originally appeared and isn't that what it's all about to be folks\nIsn't it all about credibility you see this is all you know you've heard of ... and the armor right it's like every couple of days there's another chicken the armored there's another ... there was another hit to her credibility and so\nWe could talk about this double door we could talk about what was this double door was this double doors something that she needed to escape the the horrors of her past or was it simply a way for them to a run down this the second part of their home\nThis renovation to another therapist and and then rented out to whoever it might be whether it's it's Google for the interns or maybe an opportunity for them to rent it out as as part of their home to make some extra money\nIt does require I Would say more investigation but certainly would have does do\nAnd a lot of folks are are looking at this and saying well it certainly does raise a lot of questions and so once again we have a situation and this is a really starting to blow up now on various websites and I think that it\nIs something that Dr Ford should answer for six one five seven three seven Ninety nine eighty six Robert isn't center hill ended on WGN Robert go ahead\n[laughter] after how many days of this I have come to the conclusion and I'm sure a bunch more people and this woman is not well I wouldn't it be great go find a therapist whos crazier than you are [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah you're right uh let's hope for the second door
