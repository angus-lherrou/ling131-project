[noise]\nA ... in some of these neighborhoods that are full of Democrats\nHe says is probably one of the greatest reactions anyone who's ever had to anything ever he says and so this is again another one of those stories to tell you\nThe mentality of the lunatic all left and so when we look at this a story and then we look at how the fact that a according to a couple of different sources now including the wall Street Journal\nHere's a headline cash pouring into both parties after the bitter Kavanaugh's confirmation fight now what have we been talking about for\nA quite frankly weeks if not a couple of months now and that is which party\nIs more which party is more excited now for the midterm elections which party is now more motivated to get out early on November sixth day here in Tennessee which party is more motivated\nThe Democrats or Republicans because what they're seeing is that both parties apparently are now electrified both parties are really angry and really bitter because of the confirmation fight that we saw with Brett Kavanaugh\nNow I'm here to tell you that there have been few stories that I've covered over the past\nMany years in and talk radio in the news that have been so incredibly or anger fine as the whole Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd the whole accusations we've been talking about this for a week now and the reason why I thought that this was one story that really did truly affect me because there are a lot of these stories\nYou know you get angry about a year you may be offended by but you know not all of them really affect you on a on a personal nature you know really deep down in your guts\nThis was one the the allegations in the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh it was like a gut punch it really was because to\nMe it was so incredibly unfair these allegations\nAgainst the guy who clearly at least to me has outstanding character and so there's a lot of people on the right who have now been activated because of this and and people are vowing now to head out to the polls on November sixth and mid term elections\nAnd for a lot of us there was a number of different reasons why that story hit home Brett Kavanaugh one of them of course was\nThat it's false accusations and and this was the stories were so incredibly outlandish and the media clearly partnering with the Democrats and so is that was part of it\nThe other part of it though was it was clear\nThat for a lot of people who went to the polls during the election and twenty sixteen we went to the polls because almost exclusively for the Supreme Court\nAt our vote was essentially being hijacked\nAnd so one of the things that I Believe that we've all learned here in the last couple of months is that the Democrats will stoop to nothing and I think this is why more and more people are flooding money into their respective parties\nDemocrats and Republicans alike are touting spikes in donations to their campaign committees and two groups that support them in the wake of Kavanaugh's contentious nomination to\nThe high court now my two cents on this would be a couple of things one if you think Democrats were angry earlier if you think Democrats were angry before this weekend they are really angry now\nAnd so they are running on and donating on and voting on\nAnger\nAnd so to me that to still is what worries me because for a lot of Republicans\nYou know I think that they're now to the point where okay well Kevin I was in\nThere now complacent I think even the Republicans understand what's going on that we've seen a number of different stories now where it looks like the Democrats that may ultimately be able to take over a more seats in the house and so the Republicans are really focused on the Senate and the reason why the Republicans are focused on protecting the Senate\nIs because of the Supreme Court picks\nI agree with Lindsey Graham hey Chuck Schumer hey Nancy Pelosi if you want\nTo have Supreme Court picks you got to win the White House they say that both sides are now using the fight against a around cabinet to rally their basis to the ballot box in the mid term elections with the Democrats quote unquote slamming his judicial temperament and Republicans labeling him as a victim now clearly we know\nThat um judge Kavanaugh is a victim now\nHe's now an official member of the Supreme Court and we also by the way still have the uh Democrats are running around saying oh they're not done with Kavanaugh yet know they're going to go after this guy they're going to\nLook for him and they are going to investigate a ham if they're able to get the house fact they're going to try and set up some uh some sort of impeachment die whether or not they can do that or not is is beyond me it seems like a\nIt seems like something that is a\nA pretty far quantum leap or for the Democrats it's one thing to investigate it something completely different I to impeach but we'll have to see what happens because ah the the process with which to get through that and we'll talk about that later on in the show but the process of the Democrats would have to go through\nA ... it seems like it's something where their bark is going to be a lot worse than the actual bite because they're not going to have the teeth that they need to do what they really want to do but what we do know is this Republicans have seen almost a five hundred percent rise\nIn fundraising Democrats and their groups have raised at least Fifteen million off of a judge Kavanaugh and that whole conversation you remember a Nancy Pelosi I think it was yesterday the day before and Nancy Pelosi had sent out an email and day she had\nTalked about how she's never been this angry and she wasn't going to lead a Chuck Grassley and President Trump and some of these other folks have Lindsey Graham she was not going to let\nThe Republicans get away with this and if you would only she said I only need ten thousand of you to give a dollar right 'cause you know if you've received some of these fundraising newsletters in the past I don't know can I just asked how in the world that I get on the on the Democrats fundraiser last\n'cause it's like every day I get an email from Carl dean asking me to donate money car oh it's not going to happen\nSo is that both Republicans and the Democrats and both sides\nAre fundraising on anger now my worry is that because of the fact that the Republicans were able to ultimately confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court the last thing we can do is allow ourselves to become complacent\nNow we know that President Trump has the story goes on President Donald Trump is rallying Republicans at multiple campaign rallies\nOr a week while Nancy Pelosi is yeah motivating Democrats to come out in November the big question will be what side will benefit from a quote unquote Brett balance in November\nI think it's\nNot only going to be a Brett bounce and listen we'll have to wait and see what happens in the house of representatives I Am more concerned about the Senate\nYou know whatever happens in the house can be re done in a couple of years and and as far as the White House goes we'll see what happens with Donald Trump ultimately though we know that there's going to be more openings on the Supreme Court or in the next couple of years did you see the picture by the way there is a a photograph and a cabin off\nI'm Sorry but it is just funny I I don't think it was photoshopped but it it's a picture of all of a Supreme Court justices or at least most of them and and Clarence Thomas is sitting right next to Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nAnd of course the moments in Kavanaugh is being as taking the oath and being sworn in as the latest justice in Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg is dead asleep\nAnd I sort of thinking about this I thought how in the world I don't even though she is she's in her eighties right\nHow does she stay awake through all of the arguments that are before the Supreme Court when she can't even make it through you know how long has your average swearing in thirty minutes forty five minutes I guess whatever it is\nNot to mention the state of the union it's like every single year you see Ruth Bader Ginsburg and she's asleep and I said no offense I Want and nothing bad happened to Ruth Bader Ginsburg let's just all admit that there's going to be an opening on the Supreme Court or in the next couple of years at least one\nAnd I think that's why the Republicans are smart enough really protecting the Senate\nI've got a whole story on that front political coming up here on super talk Ninety nine seven WGN it it's not that they're throwing away the house it's not that they're giving up on the house but the bottom line is a lot of people including the Republicans know that the lasting effect\nOf Donald Trump and a a Senate that has run by the Republicans is the Supreme Court now when I say lasting effect I mean twenty Thirty years because that's how long Brett Kavanaugh he's fifty three years old I mean he could be falling asleep right ah right there like Ruth Bader Ginsburg is you know after twenty\nTwenty two twenty three years he might be a you know Ruth Bader Ginsburg who can't stay awake\nIs that what you see a new center I'm paying for it with your story silver board is now five thousand dollars per inmate for

S. so I Want to make sure I have this right\nSo you've got Kanye West and he is supporting President Trump who has led us down the road of a far better economy he's doing what he can to deal with illegal immigration he's been talking about prison reform as well\nHe's got a a gene foreign policy successes he's taken on the United nations\nAnd I can't imagine that they would talk about President

Hillary Clinton went in and voted for her when Hillary was running and you'll notice to ... didn't go after or the friend a Beyonce and Jay Z this is a story about the tolerance of the left\nThat's what this is about you know Hillary has been talking about how Democrats are apparently now we talked about this yesterday it cannot be civil to Trump and the Republicans and now we have\nBeyond saying Jay Z apparently can't be able to ... and uh he is Trump's supporting comment so this is all just more of the same visit the left and an example of their intolerance for the views and opinions of those that I'm there to disagree with them [noise]\nGot a lot more straight ahead on super talk many nine seven WGN [noise]\n\nOr kids better off in an intact family you bet they are this is Joe

one citizens in rather for county to be on the lookout for two inmates who are able to overtake a female deputy an escape overnight Dwayne half acre and Jonathan Baxter had been added to the ... most wanted list\nAnd the reward is now at the six thousand dollars each for information leading to their arrest\nPolice saying they may be armed with homemade weapons Murfreesboro schools are on a code yellow locked down which means visitors to schools are limited\nThese two inmates will last seen wearing orange pants and white T shirts we've got their pictures up on our social media pages\nIs they've been been doing whatever they can to convince the the drug companies not to sell the the drugs used for lethal injection to the states that are using it to execute prisoners right\n... and so the more complicated that becomes the less the lethal injection drugs have become available and states have to start looking for other means to put down these are these guys in and and some woman but on death row\nNow they've had to go through some of these other more easily find double lethal injection drugs and some of these executions I mean I'll even admit they'd been train wrecks\nThey really have\nSee ultimately what this is about is this is about the left to try to prevent the execution of some of these are prisoners they'd have done a poor and things and so this is just another what I Would say this is just another a delayed tax\nNow is the Gore ski is scheduled to die at some time today he had again requested the electric chair on Monday Night after the tendency Supreme Court shot down a legal challenge to our lethal injection drugs\nSo apparently adapt points to a ... told prison officials he would rather face the electric chair than the controversial three drug lethal injection cocktail\nWhich experts said could torture him to death\nIn an affidavit sent to prison officials the Gore ski framed it as a choice between two evil now realized by the way that uh this guy himself and he was convicted back in wait for it Nineteen eighty four\nWhere were you in Nineteen eighty four I was like a sophomore in high school\nI'm now God help me almost fifty one years old ... was convicted in Nineteen eighty four and killing two men in Robertson county\nHe shot them slit their throats and robbed them after lowering them into the woods by promising to sell them a large amount of marijuana yeah so he says between two unconstitutional choices I Choose electrocution\nHe stated reiterating his belief that both of these states execution method\nThe eighth amendment of the U.S constitution which forbidden cruel and unusual punishment he says I Do not want to be subjected to the torture of the current legal injection method now for the life of me I've got to find somebody who's an expert on the death penalty because\nI just don't understand why we can't just go back and I don't mean to sound crass but I Will why can't we just go back to the firing squad it's it's like Ninety five percent of the people\nOn death row use the guns in their in their ah crimes anyway\n\nSo I'd be willing to bet that you got a lot of prisoners already know how to use guns so it it seems to me like that's just a slam dunk easy solution and why is it so difficult\nI mean there must be a reason why\nI'd be willing to bet a lot of these guys on death row it's been shot once or twice in their ... you know why is anyway and whatever\nThe ... again convicted in Nineteen eighty four they say there's got to be a better way state law allows inmates who are sentenced to death for crime committed before Nineteen Ninety nine and his was in Nineteen eighty four\nTo sign a waiver choosing death by electrocution the law does not give inmates a deadline to choose the electric chair the tendency department of corrections policies around the selection are unclear\n[noise] so I guess apparently the problem is now so you've got a tendency prison officials saying you know you've had all this time to ask to use the electric chair but you chose not to ask until the very last minute now I don't know what the\nI'm not going to speak openly and honestly here I I don't know what the problem is I mean they test the electric chair from what I understand they they test the chairman monthly hasn't been used since I think what two thousand seven I Believe\nBut last time they use it I guess it worked you know very well and so there's at least to me I don't understand why as long as this guy gets put down to the crimes that he committed I I really don't care\nHow they do it I also don't care if he has his last meal I'm actually glad he's not having his last meal plus money the taxpayers of Tennessee I have to pay for this guy\nThat keeping this dude ally since Nineteen eighty ... for\nGood God anyway they talk to legal experts say that it is an interesting legal move but uh they say it also makes a statement there has to be a better way of doing this then this legal injection they say it was designed to be benign but it's not again\nThe problem is that there have been all these activists groups as anti death penalty groups that it is to convince these companies the pharmaceutical companies\nTo not sell drugs to the states that was using these particular uh drugs for the death penalty and and so now the states have had to go to more creative means in order to get this done I mean\nYou know so ultimately this is all at least to me these are all games that are being played\nA by the left and let's see what Mike has to say in Huntington at Tennessee Mike I was talking about why it is we can't just go back to the firing squad which I Believe they Utah I still uses the firing squad go ahead Mike [noise]\nDue to under way right and I'm just a little background information on for losers or maybe you're surfing on the only one personal if I could actually\nHave a ... and their their snipers and sharp shooters and the ... the ... is\nThe Ford yeah\nSee that it might that's what I don't understand is and you know maybe somebody knows but why did we move away from the firing squad in the first place I just don't I don't understand why this has become so incredibly complicated\nOne of the people there are there\nWell All right [laughter] yeah I I\nGet a night and Mike I I appreciate the call very much calling from uh Huntington yeah I I really it it's one of those stories\nWhere every time this comes up and I've been following this pretty closely for a lotta years now because uh this is something in that case you don't know my own little journey with the death penalty I Am very much in favor of the death penalty but I'll tell you what\nThere have been some instances and sadly is becoming more and more common\nWhere we find out through DNA testing\nThat these folks on death row out of these folks not a lot of them but some of them\nIt turns out that they were innocent and they figure it out through a DNA testing and it turns out I'll be the first to admit that I'm a big supporter of the place that\nThere have been a cricket cops out there in in either evidence has been planted or a local prosecutors didn't allow certain with witnesses and testimony to come forward and so there have been some\nSome really difficult circumstances that have that have happened which have questioned ah my my support of the death penalty to be honest but in this particular case\nOr it is very clear that this guy I did what he did and he's been trying to he's been trying to stay alive for years and years but at least to me and this is somebody who absolutely deserves the death penalty and batteries in Nashville and valor I was talking earlier about this story about\nThese foster parents who had been able to get custody of some of these are kids who have been coming into our country illegally and one of the things that's been happening at the end up in some of these uh center somebody's migrant centers\nAnd then they're being adopted by American families and so now we've got some people on the left that are upset about this or let's say you\nYeah I'm I caught my attention when you said that I Can't remember exactly where

I I Can't remember if ... was behind the a posthumous pardon of that that that fighter a Jack johnson member that where this is the guy he was no is John McCain I think I was a John McCain thing\nWhere Jack johnson this this uh this African American fighter from way way back\nHe he was jailed for I for a basically it was marrying a white woman and and the president got him a posthumous pardon and so that's the contacts that I think the these folks like Beyonce and Jay Z are missing\nWhich is the fact that the president is actually doing things that are good for the African American community apparently Kanye eight and a President Trump they're having lunch today\nAnd they're going to talk about what's happening in the cities they're going to be talking about stopping a crime reducing crime in places like Chicago in places like New York they want to talk about bringing jobs back to the inner cities and manufacturing those are the kinds of things\nThat Kanye is going to speak to President Trump about ... and it really makes you stop and think All right so if you're if you're beyond say well we know that beyond says anti cop right I mean we know that\nI really don't know much about Jay Z I'd\nHonest with you but I Know that beyond say is anti cop and so we know that when you look at what Kanye and a Trump or talking about it's good for the African American community\nThe surface it's all very good for the African American community so my question would be from Beyonce and Jay Z\nAll right so let's talk about what your specific issues are with President Trump as it relates to\nThe African American community because it seems to me any way that the president is doing whatever he can to to help those communities in question so I I but again\nCould I could I care or any less about a fiance or a ... or ... or Jay Z I've always [noise]\nI mean I I really could not there's a lot of things that are going on in the news today have been talking about it are quite a bit through the last couple of um of ours for Valentine's up next after the news of three oh sex [noise]\nDid you go to the day and managed to a Facebook page I really want you to there is a story up there just since we're talking about intolerance\nI thought this is a really one of my favorite stories of the day\nAnd I I wouldn't did encourage you to go to the damage to our Facebook page\nAnd see it all across the Brooklyn New York\nThere are statues of Donald Trump you know the statues are\nThe little signs for dogs\nAnd people perhaps there's statues with signs that say pee on me yeah\nAgain they're all over the uh the city of Brooklyn they're in a New York a series of small statues this is again it's all about a tolerance [noise] maybe that's an R. Kelly marketing plan maybe it is and our tele marketing yes maybe it is an art Kelly marketing planted very well could be thank you about\nAnd if you don't know what that means I don't want to talk about a look it up in at that very much of a Google moment it's to sixteen and frankly a moms are in the in the car with their kids\nA series of small statues depicting President Trump where they sign reading pee on me have appeared across Brooklyn\nIt's all abroad to courtesy of a guy named Phil Gable he's the guy that has been placing the statues\nAnd yeah they carry a I'm a sign that says pee on me and essentially what he's doing is he's he's advocating for dogs and I would say people as well to urine eight on these statues of Donald Trump he says this is largely just a personal expression of my own disdain for President Trump\nBoth of the president and a human being\nI mean good lord can you ah can you imagine if this was a these are little statues of a rock Obama can you just imagine the outrage but we all know what's good for uh the the the right it is not necessarily good for the left and so\nUh this is one of those moments where clear it's clear we all know that it is a open season on a Republicans\nSo one of the things that he says this guy who this guy Gable who did these statues all across the Brooklyn it does it grab some of these phones out of the ringing off the hook another and there's often that are inside baseball there sir\nOr he says I went with the younger looking Trump because I think that's probably how he sees himself gamble says especially when he's paying Russian escorts for golden showers see facts don't matter to the left right\nWe all know that the dirty ... there is absolutely no proof\nOf any such thing there in the dirty dossier and it was all on verified information so that is what's happening again it's all just another sign of the or intolerant left speaking of intolerance\nCaches now pouring in for both parties after the bitter a cabinet confirmation fight now\nOne of the biggest questions that we have over the last several months has better which side is more activated is it the Republicans or is it the Democrats and I would say that the most activated side is going to be\nThe Democrats why you ask well unfortunately it's because they are being led the resistance you've got of course Hillary and uh also Obama and some of these other folks and George Soros is funding\nSaid resistance and so the Democrats they were fueled by hate and their fueled by anger and all you have to do\nIs look at what we've seen a over the weekend with judge Kavanaugh\nWhere you've got these folks on the left when he is being sworn in it you've got to the Democrats and and the liberal the crew are and get the door of the building as Kavanaugh is being confirmed and taking the oath inside I mean I just\nI don't know why I found that's so funny but I loved that part of the story\nBut when you start converting that into actual cash this is where it starts to get worrisome because of the fact that we have a lot of these are Democrats like like George Soros\nWho are funneling billions of dollars into the campaigns of Democrats and that's where the stuff gets real if you know what I mean because here's what we know\nWhat we know is that the Republicans could very well and have some issues in the house of representatives we've been seeing this over and over and over again as a matter of fact ah here's a headline for you it it's um\nIt says GOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by a democratic ... bending sue now me\nAnd so even though both parties both sides of the aisle are\nIn more money it it seems to me at least in this particular article\nThat at the Democrats are going to perhaps\nA overtake some Republicans in\nThe house of representatives and it seems like what the Republicans are doing is they're really trying to hold on to the Senate because that is where the Supreme Court nominations in the confirmation hearings and everything else\nThat's where everything happens regarding the Supreme Court it's President Trump and the Senate and so it it seems to me and as as some of these folks are some of these experts are looking at\nWhere the money is being spent and where they where the super PACs are spending\nCalled them right now you will not be sorry six one five three
