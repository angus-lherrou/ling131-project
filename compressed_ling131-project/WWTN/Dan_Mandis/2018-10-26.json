line is this is all legit and I'm very well could be folks just so you you all know\nThis very well could be legit and it could be a legit to arrest\nAnd just because all of these stickers on this guy's car looks brand new I ... it could be legit and this guy very well could be a Trump supporter\nThat doesn't mean because remember\nOne of the things that we've been talking about for the past to watch for days three or four days\nIs the fact that the media has been talking about how\nUh this is indicative of all Trump supporters and about how President Trump itself should be accepting responsibility for what this guy allegedly did\nAnd they're trying to make the case the media and the Democrats have been trying to make the case that this is indicative of the mentality of Trump

she had a big old target\nOn her back so we'll talk about that and what led to her dismissal and also who else another high profile firing I couldn't believe this you know just got fired\nJohnny Depp is out is that kept the jak sparrow in pirates of the Caribbean according to ah the daily mail and a couple of other places now pick this up as well and apparently now I think has there been four or five I don't know how many a pirate movies there have been over the last uh\nThe years or Fifteen Years five is now fifty five years old and are there have been five powers movies over the past Fifteen Years\nAgo the first three were absolutely outstanding the last two I'll be honest with ya I I really didn't like him\nBut you know a lot of our kids grow up watching pirates of the Caribbean and a Johnny Depp here's what I Wonder [noise] so now the Johnny Depp is is no longer a captain jak sparrow than when you go to ... when you go on the ride at Disneyland\nOr or Disney World and for them you know they they completely a couple of things if you've ever been on parts of the Caribbean ride in a Disneyland or Disney World they totally PC it outright that they made it totally politically correct\nBut they also took out the pirates it was in there before and replaced those pirates with captain jak sparrow\nSo when you're when you're leaving the ride when it's almost over you go down to the little hallway or little you know it's a tunnel if you will and there's captain Jack off to your left I Wonder now that he's been fired as the um as captain jak spare on pirates of the Caribbean\nWell they have whatever the next um whatever the next actor is who who's going to play captain jak sparrow\nNow they don't say as far as I can tell they're not saying what the next move is\nFour pirates of the Caribbean I I you know what I could see\nI could actually see them doing\nSort of like a prequel like how to capture jak sparrow become captain Jack I don't know if they've actually done that already I don't know but that could be next that here's what we know about that Johnny Depp\nOr he is had a ton of problems he's got problems with uh some alcohol he's had some marital issues as we um was you may or may not know but he's had\nAs a marital issues as well he's had some personal dramas and I'm so on and so forth and and bottom line here is the movies and not been making the money that they once did as well so so there is that making Kelly or she is the Ben let go from NBC\nYou know one of the interesting thing it things is one of the one of the interesting things is that for Megan Kelly you know one of the things that she said was\nYou know and this is why she's getting fired people are saying that she made a a racist statement when she was talking about a black face and how if you are a white and you put on black face will then you're a racist but if it's the other way around not so much and also she talked about how it's OK at Halloween and when she was a kid\nIt was okay to do it in certain instances\nAnd so on its surface I I understand what she was saying but one of the things that you got to realize is if you are on one of the major networks that kind of stuff don't fly because it's all about political correctness and so when she made that statement\nIt was like NBC the the the entire network just absolutely melted down heads began exploding and she came out of the very next day and and and she apologized and I've played that audio for yesterday and I don't want to revisit all of that\nAnd we'll see if it starts on time but this guy a Caesar say oc is the first half hour of the program I was talking about how this just seems so absolutely convenient\nUh for the left I mean it really does this guy's van is is completely covered in Donald Trump's stickers and anti liberal stickers and a sticker that says CNN sucks\nAnd they've got an entire a profile of this guy as well and it's it's full of a a criminal history he's a a registered Republican in other words the narrative is so convenient for the Democrats and and I you know\nYou're going to call me a conspiracy theorist whatever but I mean listen

ago so this is what happens whenever a name comes out whenever they're breaking news right and and somebody's name is released\nThen you find out you know there's Internet sleuth out there there's people that that they can find out information and so people are saying well a long time ago this guy was a a registered Democrat so there's that aspect of it as well but just to make sure that we're clear\nIf this guy is a legitimate a Republican illegitimate Trump supporter which he very well could be\nThen I I abhor what he did I don't like what he did in in any way shape or form\nOr if it turns out that this guy is a a is a true Trump supporter he shouldn't have done what he did and if this is something that ah was work is rated by an operative for the left then I'm also an equally offended by it by that active there\nInto a manipulate the midterm elections so either way I don't like what's what's been happening here in the last ah forty eight hours I really don't\nBut according to this guy Facebook page yeah he's a Trump fan who posted pictures and videos of himself at a Trump rally back in October of twenty sixteen or he posted a photograph of himself wearing a make America great again hat in front of the U.S Capitol in twenty Seventeen uh his Native American\nAssuming he has more a heritage and him then lived with Warren does but we'll move on from there he is Native American according to a picture posted on his social media pages of member of the seminal\nA tribe of Florida is in his fifties and he was arrested in front of an auto zone store in plantation up for it and so then of course he was arrested and he has a van people took pictures of his van with all the Donald Trump stickers on it\nAnd I'm now it's all over social media and and TV\nCameras word there are plenty to get plenty of coverage of all of these said Donald Trump stickers on his van is a reporter Lee a former resident of New York who is living in Florida\nThe twelve mail bomb does you know all believed to have been a handled by a regional male sorting facility in southern Florida and this guy is known to a law enforcement has a history of making terrorist threats to judges according to a sources\n\nYeah even his windows were were covered which a lot of people have pointed out that that's illegal so if the authorities knew this guy was then why in the world did they allow him to a cover up all of his uh windows with these stickers oh by the way the other thing that I Would say\nJust to add to my conspiracy theory I Would also say that uh the the stickers all look the brand new\nRight so democratic operative goes to this guy we want to do this there's going to be money waiting for you and an account what ever happened I don't know but here's what we're going to do and to get your van and put a whole bunch of stickers on they're going to be brand new you know because it looks like the stickers word just put on this ban\nOr it may be the true Trump supporter and he just put the stickers on the band and to\nSupport Trump and the Republicans in the mid term election don't know\nSo the van is one of my favorite moments of the day\nThe van was covered as they with a blue tarp because it's evidence that they're driving down the highway at a right there in front of all the TV cameras the the blue tarp comes off the top of the van and uh everybody gets a nice good camera shot of\nThe van covered in all of the a bumper stickers all the all of the fan stickers it it's almost like if somebody said this to me in a in a Facebook message\nIt's almost like\nHis van is covered in means that's what it looks like it get you can see the photograph on the damage to our Facebook page and so now you've got a social media is a light\nWith ah people that are a green or or disagreeing with this notion that uh this is just way too convenient for\nThe Democrats and so that is most certainly a a most join the conversation that is going to continue by the way I hear is what we know about ... says are\nSay I'm going to find out a lot more about this guy coming up at a press conference at about one thirty and I'm not entirely sure who the press conferences um is

been charged to die\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive illegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents in certain other person's\nThreatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation perceives\nThis is the law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\nAnd so I Want to thank FBI Director ray and his team all about law enforcement partners who are here ATM Secret Service postal inspectors Capitol police are on in New York City police department\nAnd the United states attorney environment on the southern district will be in New York and us attorney for the southern district of Alabama already on a portion\nFederal state and local law enforcement officers from across this country responded immediately to the cause pain contributed to this effort we are proud of each one of them I Want to reiterate to defend it in this case is innocent until proven guilty\nBut let this be a lesson to anyone\nRegardless of their political beliefs that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats intimidation and outright violence to further and agenda\nWe will find you we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law and now director right or who's gonna incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of the day is important for ...\nFor is just\n[noise]\nAs the attorney general has confirmed we have arrested sees are say off\nIn connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or about his motives when I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest imports\nOur investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've guy including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division\nIn our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico [noise] but then I I really can't underscored this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today\nThe threat of this go end of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder at today's arrest is a testament to the strength\nOf our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together I Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab and want to go\nThis is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nThat requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort\nIn getting those devices to our lab from around the country\nWe can confirm that Thirteen IDs for center various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe a small clock a battery\nSome wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material\nThey give off sheet and energy so a reaction to heat\nShock or friction though we're still analyzing the devices\nIn our laboratory fleas are not hoax devices I Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints\nFrom one of the envelope containing an ID\nThat had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that for ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected for pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes\nAnd a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida this is phenomenal work\nWith the greatest pressure under an incredibly tight timeframe we see unbelievable work like this on TV and Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud\nOf our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe\nAnd helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\nTo try to keep the American people safe from harm and who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other\nPackages and transit now and other packages [noise]\nSo we need the help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got to help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us\nOn our tip line that one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips the FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every chip could be the one that leads to something very important\nAnd of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant finally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone\nEveryone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans not like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from the NYPD [noise]\n\nLike Chris ...\nEvery one of the men and women are the\nNYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to commend to thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement partners in his efforts including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives along with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorists taskforce\nAnd Jay TPS for New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies\nHundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops when it comes to terrorism in New York City you might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD\nThat's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger up his case told that story again New York city cops her side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning\nTogether they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise\nThe members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency services and it already sell bureau a counterterrorism bureau are patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN ball help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day\nWe said from the outset and we would identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts we can make that promise because the confidence we have no ability to investigate it delivered a precise matter\nTo me means that New Yorkers ... people across our nation are safe but it's direct to raise that there might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution\nAnd if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe I Want to thank them as the public could contact the thirties with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time\nAnd the side of the commissioner O'Neill set it well the partnerships that exist in a law enforcement profession right now in this country are\nAre extraordinary are better than they've ever been and it's ... ... what the doctor ordered for this country at this time\n\nThat they take on the audio please thank you very much it's a Ninety nine seven W T and and you just heard at the press conference on the arrest or by Cesar ... the things that they said there there's a number of things first of all I don't know if you caught it moved that take a commercial break you're in a minute but\nWhat is the thing that did the reporters really we're trying to get to was this notion that the current if I have ...\nOf the political arena did this have anything to do with this guy's motivation and Christopher Wray didn't really bite but I Love the answer to the um the answer to these two questions\nYou know one of the reporters I don't know which reporter was but what role did their rhetoric in ... political arena play and he didn't really answer Christopher Wray a kind of blew that off and then she says well let me let me have a different way\nBecause she just wanted to get this question out because you know the media wants to plant Donald Trump\nAnd she said are you concerned that they hated political rhetoric could lead to someone predisposed to violence to act out and again\nA Christopher Wray didn't really bite they're asking about and motivations and these kinds of things the media did and\nThey are simply not biting and down the other things that they talked about is ah the fact that they had his fingerprints impossible\nAt DNA as well on one of the devices and they say that the bombs were not hoaxes however when asked okay so why exactly is it that none of these Thirteen bombs went off and they didn't really answer that except to just simply say\nThat this whole thing is under investigation he is facing five federal crimes are related to mail they may mailing explosives and threats and he faces fifty eight years in prison and that is the latest on Caesar\nAs say oc and so we'll keep you updated on the very latest by the way the conversation at does continue with Phil Valentine after the uh news at three oh sex now earlier I was telling you about this guy's a past\nA criminal record I mean he he's got\nA crimes dating back to the early to thousands and they include threats\nThreats to federal judges and so forth and so we'll go over that again because people come and go here on the radio program and so it coming up I Will talk a little bit more about the criminal record of this guy because one of the things that you got to realize\nIs that he has been making these kinds of ah what'd you say terroristic threat\nFor years since so well before Donald Trump and so that is also something that we do need to point out you get the media but there clearly trying to do is they're trying to\nA plane blame the heated political rhetoric is that the reporter asked\nOr they're trying to blame that on President Trump when as we know it's not only Donald Trump that is a participating in as they say can decode heated political rhetoric in America today in the political arena know both sides\nHave been contributing to that and so that is also part of the conversation and it will continue coming up next on super talk many nine seven WGN

whole thing as a some mud deep dark operatives on the left coordinating this whole thing but at the debate that's happening online and also I guarantee you in Washington DC but the liberals in the media they are going to try to make this about Donald Trump they're going to try and make this\nAbout conservatives and about Republicans for examples courtesy of Matt Walsh of liberal violence that

officials\nHe says yeah this happened just a few weeks ago it was in the news for a brief time and forgotten immediate flick now the president was never in any danger his mail is screened and there was no chance that a letter containing this a poison would ever make it to his desk\nNobody blamed\nThe liberals for this the pipe bombs were not any threat to their targets either that people screening president Barack Obama's male or not are not going to hand him a suspicious sons will put a heavy object in the shape of a pipe bomb protruding out decides but the bottom line is is when this story came out\nAnd it was um ... and it was a rice and real poison center President Trump and some of his other administration officials nobody said well look at it the Democrats added again this is the liberal side again edit again nobody did that\n\nWe all know about the attack on the Republicans at the congressional baseball game to practice or we know that that guy was a an outspoken
