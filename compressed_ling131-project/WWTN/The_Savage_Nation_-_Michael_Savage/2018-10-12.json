at the bottom of the hour to tell you what you can do if you're attacked by anti ... or ... or over the mobs because everyone's asking me\nWhat can we do the left us out of control Eric Holder saying when they go low kick them Hillary is saying let's have a civil war\nThey're all trying to outdo each other and appeasing the left wing fanatic them off the off course\nWhat you have to understand as it's coming to your doorstep whether you want it or not there at war and they want to bring the war to your door one of the rap for you were at war and they want to bring them or to your door I'll wrap for you\nSo you're asking yourself what are your legal rights to defend yourself you don't know well okay\nDan Horowitz and I had a discussion this morning about the law\nOn this and you'll be surprised what you could actually do if they do to you what they did to that man in Portland, Oregon when he's left wing scum ran after the car and hit us car with pipes\nYou know that you have the right to defend yourself if your cars attacked by a mob you don't have to sit there and wine and call the police and you're going to find out what you actually can do to these these people\n[noise] so now I treated this morning Savage won't stop the mobs nation will fall\nAnd I gave some of my solutions one one of the solutions to stopping left wing Democrat mob violence one one pulled a nonprofit status of the ACLU\nAnd also Ross funded groups that's number one Trump past that what's already to authorize the IRS to pull the ACLU was five oh one C. three status because they violated all of the rules of five oh one C. three when they came out against cabin or\nHe can pull all of the vital wants the three which is the nonprofit status of all the front groups that George Soros funds and if they use the mob these mobs are not funded you're going to pull a lot of the action off the streets number to enact the Espionage Act\nEnact the Espionage Act\nAnd if you can prove that any of these leaders\nNational lawyers guild ACLU I can name ten other groups there all to be found and stop I Know you want to say it I I'm not a lot of say you're upset that I say that my books name as a stop mass hysteria I'll say it again\nEnact the Espionage Act and the rest of the leadership if they're violating the Espionage Act and he has a nice one for you\nI look very carefully the videos of the left wing moms and they're filled with illegal aliens who are being abroad out to these riots especially here in the west coast San Francisco Los Angeles Portland Seattle they're filled with non citizens\nThe port any alien ... arrest them immediately and deport them right over the border\nThese are all legal tactics but what you're going to hear from my attorney and your attorney the attorney to Savage Nation than our which will actually make you say are you kidding I can do that did you hear me Savage won't stop the mobs will nation will fall that's the screaming headlines\nWhen you see the former chief law enforcement officer of the United states of America [noise] I've always known what he was I Want you about Eric Holder from the get go I knew what this man was\nHe said when they go low kick him Hillary says you can't be civil with Republicans another she wants a civil war that's Hillary Clinton [noise] so let's listen to your friend Eric Holder who is now a criminal suggesting criminality and violence listened carefully\nThey have to use the power that they have gotten [noise] for for the wrong thing they want to keep themselves in how they want to cater to sexual long a\nTime for us we have a grant to be as tough as they are maybe as dedicated than they are committed in them Michele always says I Love you know when they go low\nWe\nMay go nuts [noise]\nThat was his new democratic or unease about\nThe new Democratic Party is clearly about violence and you have a choice\nHow do you fight back against violence now there are many ways to do it you can avoid the violence which is the best method\nWhether you're a U.S sportsmen are not even if you're in the boxing arena or I mean let's say martial arts the first rule is always avoid a fight outside the ring that's the first rule my advice to you is avoid situations where you can let the left wing room and get near you but let's say you're out to dinner with your wife\nAnd a waiter is one of those with let's say rings on his lips or those big earrings that look they look like a bugs crawl down areas hanging off each year whatever those symbolized\nBig things hanging off the lobes I don't know what that means I I used to know what a ring and the left the men are living on the writing of meant something else now there are some of the rings and things hanging off people's heads I don't know what they mean anymore\nBut let's say you get one of those ... jobs with the rings on the lips serving you and they have you're talking about something that you believe in maggot Trump\nStop mass hysteria whatever it is you're reading my book and then they go and they kept their little phones and they get a mob to come in the restaurant and they surround you at your table and start screaming at you what are your rights you know what they are you have to run like a coward\nOr what if they track you out of the restaurant you decide to leave because you don't want to fight\nAnd you're getting your car and these these bombs start banging on your car with pipes as they did to that poor man and in Portland, Oregon what are your rights you know what they are I don't think you do because all I hear are people lining which is how we going to stop them well less you know what your rights aren't yet unless you do with the law is\nYou're going to run from them\nAnd I'm saying don't run and don't hide Eric says Eric Holder says that the new Democratic Party stands for war and violence that's what he just said\nSo he's very clear at least Eric Holder finally came out from behind a charade of being some nice guy from New York City he's not a nice guy from New York City he's always been a thug from the get go\nAnd now that he has shown himself for what he is you have an obligation to know what your rights are and go back to what I said at first you don't misinterpret Michael Savage\nAvoid at all costs confrontation meaning do not confront these violent mobs that's what they want however if you get into an untenable situation what are your rights well you'll hear that as the show goes on the other topics are\nThe main topic would just stop the moms or the

let's say martial arts the first rule is always avoid a fight outside the ring that's the first rule my advice to you is avoid situations where you can let the left wing Vernon get near you but let's say you're out to dinner with your wife\nAnd a waiter is one of those with let's say rings on his lips\nOr those big earrings that look they look like a bugs crawl down areas hanging off each year
