who are in your opinion benefit in motion the capital persecution\nNow many of you would think it's going to be a knee jerk reaction for me and said Republicans did because the base has been agitated by this I'm not so sure as a matter of fact\nI Know two very successful conservative women who always been conservative not recently they didn't just recently voted for Trump they'd be conservative since they young youngsters\nAnd they're not happy with Kavanaugh would you believe that I was actually shocked to learn that they don't like him\nThey think he was angry I said what what do you mean he was in other words they bought the line from the Feinstein gang\nThat after they rip dismantle shreds and unfairly accused of the things he didn't do the man stood up for himself they said he he looked angry didn't look right I couldn't believe that [noise] so what let's not to be so sure it's gonna work for us\nBut many of these said dams hurt themselves by lying and scheming rather than being forthcoming with your gender the Dems expose themselves in front of the people Trump rally the base for the midterms the writers United against the fascist left\nRepublicans have benefited because they feel as Democrats behavior threatens their father son and brothers they see the Democrats are really against the constitution and due process that really against ... men\nDon't ... don't considered Charles Schumer a man\nCharles Schumer is not a true man a true man doesn't talk the way he does a true man doesn't lie for a living I heard in the morning and although I've never like this man I Know the type I mean he's the type that made me run for New York\nHe's the type of lawyer that hadn't me leave New York forty years ago I thought that he was low he was lying so overtly got frightening\nHe said oh no we Democrats didn't you lay we didn't cause any delay it was my colleagues on the other side of delayed they're running the committee hearings they're the ones that didn't delay\nYou mean Dr Feinstein of Dr Frankenstein the withheld is from the committee originally didn't delay it and throw the monkey wrench into it\nI Want you to listen again well not yet I I Can't listen to her one more time I don't know how she gets away with this without on because they run the country how who will watch the watchers remember I gave you that in Latin was asked that ancient Rome\nWho will watch the watchers will no one's watching shore and Feinstein who's watching them nobody\nHere these false claims the man has been exonerated for sure and there's no consequences that Dr fraud\nNone Dr fraud try to destroy a man and nothing happened to her\nYou know what I'm saying now I Want to do something for you that I think it will be unique and radio today I Know you're ready to turn the dial I can hear it I could feel and have a six cents after all these years I can sense when people are bored that brings shutdown already on the whole monologue theyre not interested and anxious they don't want to hear it anymore\nThey don't know what they want to hear no one knows what they want to hear what they want to do they don't know what they want to listen to our watch everyone's agitated\nHere is someone whose voice you'll recognize if you give it thirty seconds who never had an FBI investigation as to his background listened to clip the number one yeah I\nI think I was a thug [noise] for a for a big part of my uh [noise]\nGrowing up I I was a by the time I was an adolescent than have moved back from Indonesia and was struggling with these issues of\nA racial identity and the father not being in the house and you know I reacted by by a didn't take school that seriously I found the fights\nNIH Frank and um and then in consulting or substances to\nWhere it always legal about some of my favorite was self destructive\nUh my ring a six pack a ... an hour before or going back to class or things like that Mm\nSix pack before you drank a six pack before going back to class you are a thug you drank you did can consume substance that didn't stop Yemen becoming president whereas Feinstein and demanding an FBI investigation\nWhere was Schumer demanding an investigation huh well I just wanted you to hear what was what was now\nHow could they say the cabin or showing masculinity and being angry because he was being ripped apart disqualifies him how can they say anything like that you're telling me that Nancy Pelosi is not angry behind the scenes you can't imagine they're throwing shoes around her mansion breaking lamps\nYou can't believe that Kirsten Gillibrand's a monster behind the scenes you can't believe Sidney Blumenthal when he ripped the mask off isn't a ... a maniac\nWell all of them including Barbara Boxer and the others say that um he's disqualified because he's angry\nAll the anger was a disqualify who would be left standing I think anger is a salvation for people who are being ripped apart in fact the anger is a useful emotion to defend yourself with where we're when did anger becoming something to be ashamed of where'd that come from\nThese radical feminist and the cats and not angry from the minute they get up in the morning until the minute they go to sleep where where's the outrage about the anger there\nHow about Maxine Waters you think she's angry how come they don't disqualify her for anger that woman doesn't the anger management it's something that anger management would not work on a Maxine Waters that woman was born angry\nSo who actually benefited the most\nFrom the destruction of cabin or the persecution of capital Democrats or Republicans and one of the penalties for those who were falsely accused others like Dr fraud I Wonder what ... would have to say about false accusations I just wonder I mean let's be clear\nWe're living in a new age now in the world\nAnd I'm Wondering what your real law would say about bearing false witness is there a Muslim listening to the show I Know amongst the millions they must be one\nWho likes the show because my values are your values and the values of my enemy of the same as the enemies of my friends or something like that I Can't follow that one I never understood Arabic thing the enemy of my friend is my friend though the enemy of my enemy is my friend the my frenemy of my enemy is my enemy I never understood any of that stuff\nThe friend of my enemy is my enemy of my friend is an enemy of an enemy I don't get that one but there must be a Muslim out there who can tell me what their surreal law would say about bearing false witness well what does the punishment in strict Muslim societies for bearing false witness I'd like to know\nAnd that we're talking about a real horror show out there which is the destruction of wildlife on the planet it's a subject near and dear to me it says why like being destroyed at a hyper right uh we had to sixth mass extinction mass extinction conservatives should conserve not decimate\nIs apparently the guardian article uh shows the war of terror on wildlife across the globe has escalated to his ... almost a critical mass and I don't know how this has stopped we know that China consumes of ah consumes most of the ivory on the planet right\nDo you normally elephants are killed every year I don't care I get it you don't care about that the China while I means nothing\nTo do all other Republican law I fly around and I dropped cigar ashes and everyone all Trump is great [laughter]\nThat that's what passes for conservativism today you hear why most people run from it oh yeah they do I mean if I were young I wouldn't be a conservative by what I hear them say I wouldn't\nI I run from them as fast as I could yeah so you see I understand how people think and what the the

aristocracy that we're still in Germany they had secrets cells emerge and they put together some of the toughest men in Germany\nAnd they formed units coal brown shirts\nAnd they started beating of communist in the streets that's what happened I didn't say it should happen there don't condemn what I'm saying you don't want to know history you can be more on if you want you can be the biggest more on an earth but I Am going to tell you this story biggest is this story is waiting to be told and not all of you can afford a well by stop mass hysteria\nMost of you won't even understand or see it because it's being blocked by Fox News I wouldn't expect to see it on CNN they don't read books unless they support the liberal agenda but you're going to read that book my core audience will read this book and so what else happened next\nWhat worries me next the brown shirts went out in the streets with clubs and started to beat the heck out of the communist who are causing havoc in Germany and the people cheered them\nYou know that the German people who were very very middle of the road couldn't take the lawlessness and the disorder and they cheered the brown shirts at first\nThis is all true it's all an absolute fact of reality what I'm telling you the average person cheered on the brown shirts and some more men joined them and more money poured into the people supporting the brown shirts\nBut what is the lesson for those of you are listening to the show\nWell over a period of time liberal societies build up and opposition from the right wing the larger a liberal society grows so grows was it the right wing did you and I sent\nAnd so that's how Trump got elected by the way not because he's Hitler don't get me wrong of course the left with like you to think he's at least the furthest thing from Hitler you could ever imagine\n\nAnd so we had a little bit of a backlash we have a charismatic leader\nHe has some solutions but his solutions for example to block the immigration of criminals into this country has been blocked by liberal judges that too will pass those liberal judges were not elected by anybody that time will come you will see there'll be thrown off the bench\nThey may think that their immune from this but they are not immune from this and so what is what is the point that my show today\nMy point is there has been a right wing backlash in this country\nAnd we have a charismatic leader\nBut its solutions are not yet that extreme\nThe left would say any of us illusions of extreme ... said the capital was a drunk which he wasn't a is a cabinet was a rapist which he wasn't he drank too much of what college student and you know when you didn't what did they do in college what a jury and they lived through in college what Charles Schumer do in college\nWhat do you do he drank mounted shepherds drank too much about ... ... what do you know what do we know what they did in college I don't know one boy and went to college and didn't go crazy and have a good time they made that suddenly an operation\nWhat I'm saying to you is history is a very good indicator of what's coming things go around and cycles so when I say stop mass hysteria if you think that the left than it's super liberalism is a good thing for this country and the west\nYou're a hundred percent wrong you're a thousand percent wrong it will bring about the exact opposite of what the liberals hope it will bring about trust me on that I Am the author I stop mass hysteria the most important book of our time period I'll be back\n...

liberal Republican Kavanaugh is not the conservative judge that we want capital if he gets in is going to shock you with his votes especially now he's weakened what they did it was a week and um for even if he gets appointed there'll be afraid of his own shadow\nWhy would Trump with twenty five choices you know we had twenty five people nominated him to be put up for the Supreme Court vote he only chose this guy a Bush man no less a Bush man not from the collar hurry but from\nThe Bush administration a Bush fan of uh Florida why didn't pick cabin or liberal judge to begin with\nLook look

knows everything he's just demand like you\nVery bright great memory very strong we support him but he's just demand never forget that\nSo he made a mistake and picking cabinet amongst the twenty five so that becomes the next question for the political thriller called the Savage Nation\nWho is it in his inner circle who steered Trump to picking cabinet over all the other judges so far is it oh no

question as the answer and it why are our senator so we're supposed to serve us equivalent to the Roman Senate\nAnd Roman senators before wrong collapsed if you're going to answer the question which is built into the question you'll know where we are in American history how close we are to dissolving as a republic\nBecause I personally do not think this country can survive much longer I I I

briefly referenced over the years on my show and\nThere's a line that jumps out to me about the euro barbarian what happened to the invasion of Rome and how it collapsed as a result and how the civilized Roman world collapsed because of the barbarians\nAnd he quotes a a French scholar named Andre\nPosh on the hill who wrote about the flourishing Christian empire cold room at the door of

one is this Roman civilization did not pass peacefully away it was assassinated\nI Believe Feinstein and the Democrats are the barbarians of our time who are so drunk on their own power that they would destroy the republic to keep drinking in on their power\nI Believe they are the hordes that we have the at all of our lives I Believe they are the barbarians of our time no nothing illegal

and understand it's not just the corrupt senator who is simply vying for more power to bring down a guy like Kavanaugh and Trump\nThat there's something even deeper involved which is literally the
