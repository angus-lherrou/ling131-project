seems to me based on the idea that this was some kind of botched operation rogue operation and that just doesn't dovetail with the reality of the way the Saudi power structure work the reality is\nThat in order to pull off an operation of this ... brave than that you would ideally need to have some approval from the very top\nSo what is it that really fills it well\nFor me and I really believe for all humans it's your belief in God and affirmed face\nNow I Know a lot of people don't believe that or understand that and then that's fine but I'm I'm just telling ya from my personal experience I Know that's true\nAnd for others it can be a very strong family or a very strong network of friends that's the closest they can get the feeling like that Lloyd is filled but\nBut you know senator Sasse who I disagree with and a lot of stuff he's written a new book where he talks about this problem of loneliness in America with decreased\nBeing faced decreasing nuclear families decreasing amount of friends that you actually have real friends not Facebook friends not people who give you clicks on Instagram and Twitter\nAnd Snapchat you with the streak real friends that you talk with that you go to the bar with that maybe you watch football with or you go to the bowling alley whether you surf or hunt with or\nWhatever it is that you love to do play golf real friends that you can go to when something's wrong that you support when something's wrong with them the ones who help you move when you move the ones who come to your house when you're sick real friends\nAnd we have fewer and fewer of those so when you you don't have a faith in God you don't have a strong nuclear family you don't have an extended family you don't have a close friends you're changing jobs every three to four years so you don't have really close work friends what do you have\nWell you have your belief in your tribe politically\nAnd\nSo that void gets filled with all the crap that you hear from the far left professors in the far left media and the far left politicians telling you you're a victim a hobby that's why I feel so empty because I've been persecuted all my life I've been oppressed all my life I've been put down all my life and it's time for me to hit back and and these guys are so awful that I can do anything\nThese guys are like Nazis and you know what we did the Nazis we kill Nazis so therefore we can do anything we want to and that's why our Coulter says when they go low you kick them that's why Hillary Clinton says how can you be several of the people that you totally disagree with\nAnd that gives you a lot of meaning and now you feel like you're part of something\nYou're part of something big you're part of something that could change the world and now that void is filled at least for a little bit uh it'll be empty again but at least it felt good for the moment and and now I've got people around me who are who seemed to support me who seem to be my instant friends\nIt's their new religion because they don't have a real one\n\nI think that's happened and continues to happen I think it's a really dangerous that's really sad\nLook at the increase in depression in this country over the last couple of decades later the increase in the loneliness the last couple of decades look at the increase in the destruction of the American family\n\nAnd then look and see how it co sides to this tribalism and politics that we've been seeing\nAnd not just Republican Democrat but what is your tribe on black on white I'm Asian Hispanic I'm Native American well maybe I'm One one thousand twenty four Native American but I'm Still lack of America to some degree\nA five five foreigners Savage get you on board they ... that gets us into the Elizabeth Warren thing I I got to talk about it's are you kidding me yesterday I was like oh man this is amazing and it just keeps getting better because yesterday of course we learn about the test Elizabeth Warren had claimed she was a Native American\nOr places that she had gone to school claim that she had been Native American\nAnd they use that to look like they were more diverse than they really were she claimed it had nothing to do with are getting into law school had nothing to do with her getting hired to do very prestigious positions but man and by the way it was true because my grandmother told me about it\nAnd then we do the test and we find out a couple of very interesting things\nOkay first of all we find out that the test shows well somewhere between one sixty fourth Native American and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American owned by the way\nWhen you get to you know around won five hundred Native American that's less than the average European immigrant to this country [laughter]\nSo it means nothing but then you go back even further that we now we find out that the DNA test didn't even use DNA from Native Americans in this country\nI I I don't know where they couldn't find that people didn't want to give it to them but here's what we found out\nThey use\nGeneral population samples from Mexico and South America as the so called Native American sample to compare to Elizabeth Warren\nSo what she has doesn't qualified or to be a percentage of any known tribe in the United states and she claimed victory\n[laughter]\nI mean that's just an enormously hilarious she is claiming victory and it took the Native American tribes to tell her that she didn't know what she was talking about and Warren Elizabeth Warren is trying to troll Trump\nIs when the washing of this navy dateline Washington Trump's mockery of Lauren's claim of Native American history he's called her Pocahontas\nAnd said if they're offered to pay one million to charity if you took a DNA test clearly got into her head okay what's up right there he actually didn't say you would offer a million dollars to charity if you took the DNA test he actually said I watched it yesterday several times he said\nYou know if she runs for president and we're in a debate\nThen I'm going to challenge her and then he went on to talk about the tests and the million dollars so she hasn't run for president there hasn't been a debate and he hasn't challenged her it was a hypothetical that he talked about it at a rally as a joke\nAnd yet Elizabeth Warren in some in the press are trying to make it seem like he promised or a million dollars to charity if she could show quote one drop of Native American blood in her\nRemember the old one drop slave rule for blacks I thought that was a bad thing now we're making it a good thing a good thing\n\nAsked about the promise to donate to warns charity of choice Trump said only do that if I can test her personally that will not be something I enjoy doing either\nJewish Warner flies we all know why Donald Trump makes creepy physical threats about me right he's scared he's trying to do what he always does the women who've scare him call us names attack us personally shrinks down to feel better about themselves and makes his ego but it won't work um where was the physical threat\nA DNA test is a physical threat\nA Utah Republican Senator Orrin hatch who's eighty four years old he treated a photo of himself looking at his phone and his own DNA test results and it showed that he had a small fraction of\nTerrain a source rex ancestry the rest of their dinosaurs [laughter]\nThat's pretty good pretty good cook and Trump is now gone after\nPocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took bogus DNA test it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA testing as useless as with the Cherokee Nation said even they don't want\nHer phony oh what do you mean what do you mean even day what do you mean Donald even they don't want or what are you saying about the check [laughter] more on this uh let me get Donna and in Virginia a Donahue were on the Savage Nation my name's Greg NAFTA and go right ahead\nHi Greg I just want to say to you um [noise] after let's say ... and going through the whole thing with the cherry shut it ... you can argue for more on a path and appropriate and all that right to me and the whole thing is [noise]\nWhy don't we get smart about it and just move for a from all federal documents for all Americans it make sense and it's long overdue fall\nBecause like you say Don ... all of us now could claim because really we all come from the same place if you go back far enough right we all come back from the from the three the confluence of three rivers around Iraq right so if if you go back far enough\nWe're all African American we're all Asian American we're all Indian American we're all everything because we all came from the same place and and and I\nAnd my notes down a kind of what you're talking about I mean why do we care about our DNA in our ancestry and our fractions of identity I mean it it really shouldn't shouldn't it we're supposed to be the content of our character\nIt's supposed to be what we worked for we've accomplished what we've created that makes us who we are how we act how we act repeatedly over time and and when I Love now is when I see people before ... before you had a DNA test you and I were great friends and we're equals now you

[laughter] that's America\nIs the problem in the world\nWhy so many people want to come here\nWhy there's so many of the poor people still want to come to so many people want to claim asylum to come to the United states I mean if you're claiming asylum what you're supposed to do was stop in the first country that you come to and if you grab a map then\nThey shouldn't be coming to America I mean if you're leaving Honduras why are you stopping in El Salvador all Salvador's bleep hole to waste I thought President Trump got in trouble for calling these countries bleep alls\nI mean why would you want to flee Honduras unless it's a bleep hole country\nThink about that why would you want to leave your country unless it's a bleep hole country\nWhy would so many risk everything leave everything behind risk their family being robbed and members of their family being raped or murdered on the trip unless you're fleeing a bleep hole country\nSo why wouldn't you stop in El Salvador believe all country why don't you stop and Guatemala bleep hole country why don't you just go north a little bit in stopping Billy's\nI mean Americans retired ... why would you stop in Mexico play ball country they're all we've all countries I thought that was a horrible thing to say well why don't you\nGo south instead of north why don't you stop in Nicaragua believe all country how 'bout Costa Rica again we've got Americans who vacation and Costa Rica go surfing and Costa Rica relocate and retire in Costa Rica\nOr go a little further south Panama Panama again that's another uh ex patriot retirement home community down there and ... they can all be bleep all countries can they so why risk all that and go so far just get the United states since it's such a horrible racist country\nBecause we all know it's not the puts the lie to everything you hear from the far left\n\nSo they're coming again\nBecause you know people are poor and ... that's not an excuse for you to come to our country legally so President Trump is is getting out ahead of this and he said\nThat he will cut off U.S foreign aid to Honduras if they don't stop the caravan of migrants\nMoving toward the U.S border there were ... so here's the question do you think that's the right thing to do cutting off foreign aid is that the best thing to do\nWhen Honduras allows this many people to flee and what about the countries in between that are just allowing them to keep on moving to the United states of America when they know it's all about illegal alien a situation\n\nTrump tweeted out if the illegal aliens are not stop before they reach the U.S border no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective immediately\nNow there is a piece here from Mike ... and he he tries to break down\nIs is that something that President Trump can legally do can can the president say we're going to cut off aid well not if it's a it's been approved by the United States Congress that specifically for the country\nBut there are some things that he can do now according USAID in twenty sixteen the most recent here we have the numbers for we gave under us a hundred and fifty two million bucks\nAnd for twenty Seventeen so far we've given them a hundred and forty four million bucks\nAnd there's more to come and for every year since twenty Thirteen we've given at least a hundred million dollars in aid to Honduras\nSo can Trump stop it if he wants to well here's what they say\nThe president can and foreign aid without congressional approval if he makes the argument that the recipient country has violated conditions that were placed on the eight now he did this and September twenty Seventeen to stop military going to Pakistan because they didn't follow what they said they were going to do\nNow when it comes to spending all foreign aid to a nation when that ...\nI was not given with conditions then Trump doesn't have\nOne hundred percent power over that what he can do he can freeze specific foreign aid for forty five days but if it's already been approved by Congress then he needs congressional approval to keep that freeze on beyond forty five days what do you get that he might\nI mean you've got the house but you don't have two thirds of the Senate but you don't need two thirds unless they filibuster let me go on and on\nNow one exception if you're close to the end of the fiscal year if you're within forty five days at the end of the fiscal year you can freeze it for the forty five days the fiscal year ends and the money's and so there are some options do you think you should use those options\nThis is one of the big things that he ran on that we have to have a law and order that you have to have borders it's one of the things that Dr Savage talks about all the time if you don't have borders you don't have a nation\nAnd the idea that somehow poverty as the excuse to violate the borders of multiple nations to come into our country illegally then\nWhy do we have any borders at all and why do we have an immigration laws at all and and don't we see how that impacts American citizens and legal immigrants and people are waiting to be legal immigrants it totally undermines the fairness of our immigration system and the fairness of what our government does for our own citizens\nIt look if you really want to help the people in Honduras to help the people in Honduras and you can do that by going on a mission trip spy donating money by donating food but you can do all kinds of stuff but my ...\nBut what what what the liberals want to do is to force everyone to break our loss and they really don't care what impact that has on the country\nIn economics in our schools in our prisons and our hospitals they don't care\nBecause they seem as votes oh you don't you don't

Arabia correspondent Clarissa wars\nJust a broadening of skepticism about this therapy narrative which although not official yet seems to me based on the idea that this was some had as botched operation rogue operation and that just doesn't ... with the reality of the way the Saudi power structure works the reality is\nSaudi Arabia has a lot of pressure on it pressure from Iran\nPressure from oil prices pressure from its own people internally pressure from\nA modern world where the country that is ruled with an old style system that is not ready for modernization problems with a population that doesn't really want to do any work\nI mean there are a lot of people in Saudi they just don't want to work because hey we're part of the the ritual lead and we make our money off of oil and we hire everybody to do everything for us\nThey got a lot of problems going on a Saudi Arabia\nBut moms have been so long some and excuse me for a position himself as he was going to be the new the new leader\nOf Saudi Arabia to lean into maternity to lead it into a a representative democracy\nAnd there are people who are buying Matt now because she'll get is credible saying that in what's happening here this guy put his own mother on house arrest because he thought she was trying to consolidate power against them so here's Lindsey Graham saying\nThere is a difference between a country and an individual but been Solomon is toxic and can never\nBe a world leader on the world stage this guy has got to go and he turned to the camera Saudi Arabia if you're listening there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS it changes your country and tainted yourself so they asked him what you mean civil\nYour job my mind a peculiar but you just told them to do but the position of crown princes not elected well doesn't matter so then he was asked by his aides were asked is Graham addressing king Salman or other members of the royal family\nAnd\nThey told CNBC I think you answered your own question\nOkay so do you agree with that do you do you think that America can deal with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia anymore but there has to be a situation where the the house of south pushes him out elevate somebody else and then we can deal with them again\nOf course Trump's trying to downplay the problem with this journalist being killed sane first of all we got to make sure that's really what happened secondly then we got to figure out what to do about it because Saudi\nArabia is our ally against Iran\nA lot of oil coming out of Saudi Arabia and that can really influence world politics and world economics\nAnd we signed a big deal with Saudi Arabia that has a lot of jobs hanging in the balance a lot of these defense contractors huge companies like Boeing that hire an awful lot of Americans to do work\nIs hanging the ... oh so for you it's okay if somebody gets killed so that we can have a few jobs in America is that how it works of Mr\nKnow but there are these things called pros and cons and there is a thing called a cost benefit analysis and there is this thing called reality\n... there are no perfect leaders to work with in the middle east there are no perfect countries to work with in the middle east there is never been a perfect leader of Saudi Arabia\nThere hasn't even been a really good one\nBut we still need to be able to work with that country so that leads me to the peace put out by Walter Russell Mead today in the wall Street Journal where he says don't ... and a fit of righteousness yes to show these murder must be condemned but Saudi Arabia still serves the u._s. interests\nAnd that's what Trump talks about what it means America First\nYes they they were very upset about what happened but does that mean you throw the baby out with the bath water and that's the point is trying to get too\nSays look secretary\nOf state Pompeo is in Riyadh now to try to handle this\nAnd he understands what's going on in the middle east and he knows the crown prince is Saudi Arabia is not an authoritarian caterpillar met a more fussing into a liberal butterfly\nBut neither are turkey or Iran and on the crucial issues\nUs in Saudi interests are aligned we want to make sure no single tower inside or outside the middle east has control over the world's oil spigot so Saudi Arabia must remain independent and secure so we\nDo things we shouldn't do says Walter Russell Mead you can't just sweep this under the rug you can't just sweep the murder if it is a murder of the journalist show you under the rug but you also can't just throw the baby out of the bath water you can't jump into what the Iran deal course in the air to want a Muslim Brotherhood apologist want he says\nTo dissolve the U.S Saudi alliance in a frenzy of righteousness that would be an absurd overreaction that would help our enemies not us\nHe brings up a good point back in Nineteen eighty five\nFrance had agents sink the Greenpeace ship rainbow warrior an innocent\nMan died did we kick them out of the European Community or NATO\nNope\nSo you can't lie an eyesore ostracized or unable\nNBS in Saudi Arabia but you do need to send a message to Saudi Arabia\nAnd you need to have the Saudis and the Israelis coordinate on a policy to contain Iran stabilize the region and encourage the economic transformation the Saudis need in their own\nCountry what do you think to me that makes perfect sense will will will uh Walter Russell\nMead the same makes perfect sense you can't ignore it but you can't allow that to destroy an alliance that we still need look we didn't let nine eleven destroy the alliance that we need and some of these days are Saudis\nBecause you have to live in the real world and Trump is in the real world and the thing in the real world are we going to allow that to cancel who knows how many jobs in America who knows how much that would hurt our economy how much that would trickle down to you\nHow much would a big disruption in the oil markets which you come from this trickle down to you and that's what he means when he talks about America First and that's what we're supposed to happen but president somebody who you know kinda balances out\nThe pros and cons does it cost benefit analysis and always comes out on the side of this ... will help America and American citizens the most and that's what you got to do\nIt's not always pretty but that's what you're supposed to do that's what a leader does\nWhat you think a five five foreigners Savage get you on board the program\nEight five five four
