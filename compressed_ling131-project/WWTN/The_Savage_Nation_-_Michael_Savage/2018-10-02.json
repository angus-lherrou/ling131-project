[noise]\nThe cabin on pro trade deal I can see I can can you said Mr Gates sexual assault allegations against Supreme\nCourt nominee Brett Kavanaugh corresponded film adding like reports on the process\nOf the White House has to order it and the FBI does\nDoes it say interviews I was just reading you mentioned that information back to the White House the White House in saying that the Senate hundred senators because if the Supreme Court nomination will have access to that information they'll have to read it in a private room that information cannot be released publically only very limited number of staffers will have access to that information\nOne of them said maybe they were at work running their own businesses hiring people getting out of debt saving for retirement well that's probably true but liberals also have businesses\nNext one says because liberals are always all in\nRegardless of the cause liberals and Democrats alike message well independents Republicans never have which is why the ... book was successful why make Cape ... and Ford have huge go fund me liberals message well support each other\nBut unfortunately our shot many of you think is just going to happen\nAnd it's shown now you have to ask yourself that with a story like this and here it is an asymmetrical Michael Sam alone no one in the media on my side that I Know of why wouldn't this be a story on fix news network why it's a big story your story\nWhy won't they touch it forget me for a minute I'm surprised that both sides and were cut off yet and make believe that it was his lucky dive times this year why did X bow tie not do it well there's a story about bow tie in his connections to see you have to understand the connections between media and the very same\nAh connections let's put it to you that way\nYou don't know about that of course because you are kept in the dark as many times you only see the shadows on the wall you don't actually see the players ... see the people who are lighting the fires behind the players all you see the shadows on the wall how do I Michael Savage the independent\nStand a chance in this forest of shadows how I'm going to ask you another question why is it that Trump's war became a number one book on the New York times without any appearances on an Asian shows why is it that that my obscure book God faith and reason\nBecame a best seller without any media except males certainly on the Drudge Report which is an enormous and big the only TV show I was on was the Huckabee show\nOn an obscure network disease and honest guy this guy's it on a straight shooter he likes to get it the truth but every last one of them on Fox News is absolutely afraid to talk about me for some reason I think I Know the reason why\nAnd it has nothing to do with the intelligence agency\nSo what I Want to do for you today as ask these questions\nI Want to find out why you think this big story of her connections or her legit connections so far not disapprove of are not being picked up by the media why I don't understand it you say well OK people are afraid well I'm afraid I'm under increased security as a result of that poll way\nBut I have to ask myself\nMaybe they're a rogue factions inside the CIA who were actually in favor of the patriotic side maybe not every element of the CIA reports to duty\nFor that bomb that they threw out the Trump pulled as a security clearances of I forget his reading maybe there's a lot of Brennan holdovers do you think they could act rogue or are the robes going to stop the road traumatic to grow I don't know\nI Know this I'm so far in there's no way to go out you understand what I'm saying to you I Am so deeply come to the truth there's no way to pull myself out of it I Can't I Can't go back there is no going home again do you understand that\nEasier in this business to get or get the hell out of this business then you're nothing but a clown you may as well get Emmett Kelly up their beeping a horn calling himself a conservative\nJust get Emmett Kelly to get up there belch on the air everyday and call themselves a radical wild conservative because that's what you're getting now you're getting clouds making believe they're really getting it the truth I don't see the truth out there it's the same garbage every day\nDemocrats no good Republicans ... Donald Trump Virginia is not on something right as Donald Trump this Donald Donald Trump's great but he's not everything they say is\nNor isn't that great by the way\nAnd so here we are\nFacing the music this morning read Trump's trade deal with Canada and Mexico\nOn and on on and on the trumpet tears were out there glorify after deal did any of them actually look into the deal oh I did I looked into the NAFTA deal the one that was greatly lord of the ... or as some great savior of America's businesses\nAnd I was actually stunned to see it's all BS by the way\nDid you know the Canadian oil exports up to two point six million cars will not be impacted by any us tariffs on foreign cars\nDid you know that Mexico got the same threshold level of exporting two point six million cars into the u._s. but here's the kicker country export exports that many cars to the U.S so much smoke and mirrors and so it's just a charade it's\nJust a charade the businessmen who are running the country are doing a very good job in the economy on the economy\nDidn't do anything for the average any out there nothing I saw nothing in this that's positive\nSo want me to do get up you're like Emmett Kelly and tell you it's wonderful biggest the blimp does it every day and the bloody throw it does it every day what do you want me to do the one that I won't be one of them I'm an independent I always have been always will be and so therefore have to go back to the original story\nWhy is this major story being ignored it\nWhy how do you let this happen all these talk shows have call in line why don't you call in and ask all these great geniuses in the media why they don't report about this so I brought it to light or what or their bosses tell them no no no no no no we don't go there\nWe don't go there it always stick to the basic vanilla manila swirl every once in awhile but you're not going to get into the real McCoy yeah we don't want to go there\nWell those are some of the questions that are really bothering me right now because this is a gigantic story which is Dr fraud\nNow don't get me wrong I don't think cabin on is the uh Knight in shining armor that that they want him to be he's a great choice but he's a Bush\nMiddle of the road Republican how many times do I have to say that to you he's not the flaming conservative that the illegitimate or making them out to be he is a middle of the road conservative judge from the Bush administration but even that's too conservative for the communist Steve's on the other side\nAnd I still don't understand that despite all of the attention on her why Donald Trump himself does not stand up there and say wait a minute now Senator Feinstein millions of Americans are asking you about that shyness by that you are driving for you

on Michael Savage dot com you would think\nOne of the great reporters in America would be interested in it after all the way just to have a best seller from a guy who wrote a book forty years ago about Watergate some old hat they dug up in an elevator somewhere I don't even remember his name oh what's his name I forget is that I Swear to God I Can't I Can't remember his name he's in significant\nAnd yet what his book came out it sold a million copies in the day why is that\nWhy is that because there's a fix the fixes in\nNow if any one of the connections between Dr Ford and the intelligence agency is false I ask people please this prove any of these points nobody refuted any of those points when you think that Senator Lindsey Graham\nWouldn't you think that one of the so called Republicans on the committee would raise the issue of wait a minute how will will will will she's with the CIA recruits at Stanford what does it have to deal with the capital hearings if you can't figure that out then you're dumber than a poster\nAnd yet you buy books that's the funny part about all of this to me and I asked this question this morning because if the weather's me and maybe you have an answer for me\nHere's my question why do liberals support their movement like assuming the lying books while I was I'd sits on the sidelines refuses to support independence like Michael Savage asks a listener and then I say stop mass hysteria which will be out in a week so we put the answers up there\nOne of them said maybe they were at work running their own businesses hiring people getting out of debt saving for retirement well that's true but liberals also have businesses\nNext one says because liberals are always all in regardless of the corps liberals alike message well independents Republicans and never have which is why the comic book was successful why make Cape ... at Ford has a huge liberals message ... support each other\nBut unfortunately our side does not\nMany of you think is just going to happen on his own\nNow ask yourself that with a story like this year it is an asymmetrical Michael Savage all alone no one in the media on my side that I Know of why would be a story on fixed news network why it's a big story\nIt's a new story why won't they taught you forget me for they've been on that boat so I didn't work at off yet and make believe that it was here's what he did three four or five times this year\nThe expo tight not do it well this is still time his connections to see you have to understand the connections between many people in the media and the very same ah connections that way\nYou don't know about that of course because you are kept in the dark as I told you many times you only see the shadows on the wall you don't actually see the players nor do you see that people were lighting the fires behind the players all you see the shadows on the wall so how do I Michael Savage the independent\nStand a chance as forest of shadows how I'm going to ask you another question why is it that Trump's war became a number one New York times without any appearances on any TV shows why is it that that my obscure book God faith and reason\nA best seller without any media except maybe a it was certainly on the Drudge Report which is an enormous in big the TV show I was on was the Huckabee show\nOn an obscure network disease and honest guy this guy said on a straight shooter he likes to get it the truth but every last walks news is absolutely afraid to talk about me for some reason I think I Know the reason why\nAnd it has nothing to do with the intelligence agency\nFind out why you think this big story of her connections or her legit connections so far or not this proven or not by the media why I don't understand it you say well OK people are afraid well I'm afraid I'm under increased security as a result of that posting by the way\nBut I have to ask myself\nMaybe they're a rogue factions inside the CIA who were actually in favor of the patriotic side maybe not every element of the CIA reports to duty\nFor that bomb that they threw out that Trump pulled as a security clearances of I forget his name Brennan maybe there's a lot of bread and holdovers do you think they could act rogue or are the road was going to stop the ... I don't know\nI Know this I'm so far in there's no way to go out you understand what I'm saying to you I Am so deeply committed to there's no way to pull myself out of it I Can't I Can't go back there is no going home again the or understand that either you are in this business to get to the truth or get this business\nThen you're nothing but a clown somebody put this up on my Twitter feed Soros leftist groups were responsible for buying one way to barred would Bob Woodward's book I don't know if that's true and then he said music industry record labels used the same ploy\nTo create a false positive board magazine for most record so which creates a buzz for Lehman consumers well it's also been done on the conservative side I Know for a fact it's well known as one individual who poses a great intellectual genius did that\nHe had an organization by the books for him and my age and said to me Savage are the only one I Know of those", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "02"}
