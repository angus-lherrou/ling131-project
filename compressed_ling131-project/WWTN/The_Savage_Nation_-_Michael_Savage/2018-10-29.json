the bill Cunningham show Joel how are ya\nI could even bill cranky for taking my call but instead I have for you I have some friends that called me earlier today from Korea and they're talking about and that's to kill them who's running as the Democratic candidate for governor you know that what they're telling me is that they can write a lot of commercials on the state of Florida\nAnd which do you have and also they've been having rallies and which both Al Sharpton who you spoke of earlier as well as a lot of um um Maxine Waters and others have been in the state of Florida campaigning and they have been coming up in reference to a federal indictment\nInvolving this to kill him and that kind of a peak keeps coming up with the race card\nI'm Wondering what your thoughts are in reference to the Florida writes\nAndrew Gillum is a socialist his background is similar to the Democratic candidate in Arizona Andrew Gillum believes in the most left wing radical viewpoint of the police department Andrew Gillum is set in the past the guy who would be the governor of Florida\nThat the police departments are like occupying forces that began as slaves catchers it's the most radical governor Florida whatever have now they're saying this is not the most a\nLot of the most exciting character I Know but at least he's not into Gillum and at least he wouldn't go to the same route of the Bernie Sanders\nMaxine Waters type and he would take over Florida government in cash straight the police departments you've numerous police departments and Florida that have said they cannot support this guy because of his beliefs about the police you can't support him have Andrew Gillum wins in Florida I Would be shocked\n[laughter] being called by the people that are called me up their

with the tragedies the tragedies this week and the one that happened on Saturday ah joining me now is Thomas ... former NYPD investigator and a very knowledgeable about the situation is rather should attempt to mass murder or whether it's an anti Semite who kept below the radar most of the reporting on this\nUh on Saturday today a ... has been along the lines that this is Robert Bowers was just a wonderful guy the uh NBC News this morning at on a neighbor lived next door to him a very sad woman who said boy kept to himself quite friendly that kinda stuff\nJoining me now is that the same Thomas Russian former NYPD officer investigator detective and Thomas dress getting welcome again in the bill Cunningham shown Thomas Jorja\nLeap goody very\nTough situation an awful um but when I watch some of the morning and afternoon coverage of Robert Bowers forty six years old I guess no previous criminal record at all\nAnd I hit menial jobs was a truck driver did various other little things next door neighbor a woman said boy he was quiet kind of shy and he said oh goodbye no difficulties\nHe had posted online for quite a while and I met him ranting and raving including hatred for Donald Trump the president because he thought Trump was too uh too nice on Israel\nDidn't like the fact that Trump's grandchildren Jewish and ah he didn't like the fact that a Trump like the state of Israel nonetheless\nUh the media is pointing this out somehow Trump's responsible the Washington Post ah yesterday afternoon\nIt today did ugly reporting saying that uh\nThat in fact the sheriff standards put out something a few hours you know just said is there any tragedy of the Washington Post went out exploit\nDo attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh was committed by a coward who hated President Trump because Trump is such a on a public defender of the Jewish community in the state of Israel\nSo let's go back from a police perspective ... said uh the analysis the experts\nAmount of the woodwork now saying to Pittsburgh Police should have known the FBI should have known\nHow many thousands or millions I I've been tempered comments rather racial ... anti woman anti male whatever anti homosexual or is it is on social media like everyday who's going to monitor that monitor that and Tom do you see any followed by by law enforcement in this case\nI it not as of yet I've seen is\nYou know there's always twenty twenty especially in the law enforcement or the investigative world when I Can't believe that no one else was honoring his tweets is social media\nAnd there's other things he was posting and couldn't have alerted only what the what we always say is a few things say something [laughter] this case you know someone had to have seen this I\nCould've alerted the police on the police if we find out that the police the FBI or some law enforcement agency was told about ... hours and do something or didn't look to see if this guy does have guns\nOr potentially follow him we can criticize the police but until that time police and law enforcement agencies and even intelligence agencies don't have the manpower the bandwidth\nTo be able to follow every single person that they get a complaint\nAnd even sometimes like the shooting in Broward County there was one in her call FBI numerous people call it about an Eighteen year old punk mentally ill insane person that just shot up to high school\nAnd even though call in or an FBI people call it in that wasn't followed up on even if those things happen there's no perfection there's no perfection and law enforcement correct\nThere's no perfection on force but you're only as good as shifts today and wish I could go on for civilians very easy to do after seeing a law enforcement is tough on itself I Know from my experience with the NYPD\nWe always look back we always did a review of what had happened and what we could do better at the same way that they're doing with the case the bombings or the bombs that were sent\n'em they're looking back and figuring out what could we do better in the future and that's what law enforcement agencies I'm short Pittsburgh and the FBI\nAnd other agencies are doing towards ... and ... hours\nIn fact a Bowers had a postage just a few hours before the slaughter on Saturday morning quote I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered screw the optics I'm going in unquote so whoever he was dealing with social media somebody knew or should have known this guy was disintegrating\nAnd in that person did not do anything now the experts instead\nBecause I'm sure there are several thousand individuals sadly in the country like ... hours\nWaiting for a trigger moment that social media exacerbates highlight these kinds of feelings\nBecause those of like minded get together and they feed on each other's hate before social media ten twelve years ago you sent letters or you made phone calls but in social media you can be a friend hundreds and thousands of people\nOf like minded like those clowns marching around Charlottesville shouting slurs against ah against Jews\nAnd against African Americans over several hundred who did that they use social media to get together in the they feed on each other and feed on their hate now the media doesn't well report this but this guy hated Donald Trump he he he'd previously road I never voted for Trump\nNor have I ever owned Warner even touch the mega had he goes on about Trump's grandchildren being Jewish ... but the media still jumping on Trump for some reason because the climate out there that everyone is causing the president is one of many causing it\nYes I totally agree and take what you said even further this president has a son who is\nOrthodox and a very religious Jewish guy he has a daughter who converted to Judaism and as you said his grandchildren or Jewish so you know I I don't think it's a matter of\nYou know what it said it's a matter of how we're saying that matter for law enforcement standpoint of it has to be held back because you're pressing police departments to their degree right\nThey have to be ready to respond to a ... a guy goes into Times Square but no one of the reason that he wants to kill innocent people going to the theater in New York City on may Twenty years ago and thank God he failed terrorism school\nAnd couldn't blow up his own car because he would have killed if not injured hundreds if not thousands of people but there are not like this around the country it's what keeps law enforcement people up at night\nWorrying about this lone wolf the guy who's not really talk to someone the guy who was sort of a loner a guy who's pretty well thought of in this neighborhood who is capable of grabbing his guns and go into a place in killing innocent\nPeople for no other reason than his ideology or his private jeeze\nThomas is out there all the way but Thomas ... former NPD NYPD officer thanks for

Fridays intelligent he protects me I Love that guy and so when the media\nThat can't Ken has to do like an angle shot to blame Trump for Pittsburgh when this guy had posted this mass murderer Robert

Trump they and they won't stop Sam they won't stop\nHe looked I work for Donald Trump very closely from two thousand eleven twenty Fifteen I Know if I could very well um this man as as you mentioned before received awards throughout the years but and I would tell you that side I'm a patriotic American that were happy\nWhen he was able to pull off upset the probably the country that was second happy it's was a Jewish state of Israel and he kept that promise\nThat everybody in every ... anybody has promised before all the other politicians\nYou know it's ironic I was with a a I was at a Republican a club with a lot of push people and the other day and I had to them you know you guys always used to tell me that Bush was the best for Israel and Donald Trump is proven that pushed in there and you can do it now but when you were saying about Jerry never I Know him very well\nCherry as someone who has been passed up time and time again by the Democrat Party you want it to be

a sense twenty five to twenty eight seats in his ... margin\nThat's less than half that's less than half of what Obama lost but it went in significant impacts because what it would mean\nFor

David how're you doing\nDoing great my friend that you\nGo let me share with the American people something you of a put forth in one of your miss them and that is what's going on and with all this stuff going on with the mailing bombs and all that stuff going on in the victims and and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in this article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin ten of reaching us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum the impetus for this latest Caribbean is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal in Oregon I stumped by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon\nTo foment border chaos and I might add to the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place\nAnd said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that\nSo what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the major media will do it\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when Fidel Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill a Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population is a way to destabilize\nAnd disrupt a you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a\nAccording to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a\nAsia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are are coming along and doing it on their meals are suddenly appearing pets are settling\nAppearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here\nIs it a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably the most important mid term election and your in my lifetime you know I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo hang out with a guy who won it in the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party explained why now here we are getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden\nTens of thousands among door and show up at the same place at the same time with precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on his belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's too many events happening with the media will uncover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate uh caravans that are formed the largest one that we are talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women pushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of panning the crowd and showing the visual\nAnd I've seen a pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen praise of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift are not only destabilize South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTwo or Jimmy Carter's a election downfall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit himself\nI think that that this is an attempt by left this government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nIs embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nThe media doesn't cover any of that because it doesn't fit but\nHi David uh Dave right we've got to go the federation for American immigration reform it's fair ... a A R I read your stuff all the time and I wish you the best

you know this this gets\nInto the whole conversation of of where we are you know as a country right now we've seen you know the the the blame game\nEspecially from the left the last couple of days or not that it's ... to the left but the vast majority on social social media and in the media in general\nIs the left attempting to blame Trump whether it's a synagogue shooting or whether it's the you know the the the mail bomb or a ... year I I mean the the piling on is just incredible I mean we live in a society where the left and I think it's very important\nIf you if you see what ... Harrison Cory Booker and everybody is talking about free health care well forget about it you're never going to pay for it because you can't tax everything that the rich has to pay for everything that you want but it's interesting because they're bringing up the deficit and the debt and look good luck with Trump's on the debt and we've all been said this\nFor a ...\nYou and I've been doing the show for Thirteen Years so we were there for the last few years with the Bush administration ... where we had Democrats constantly calling St Bush were spending too much and we said well we hope you're here when Obama is is back in in in ... when Obama was in power and by the way we criticized Bush on a spit yes we ... we absolutely\nDid yes ah and we [laughter] we create criticized one of the images of of Texas a conservatism Tom DeLay when he told\nA conservatives to shut up because we cut just about everything we can and the budget we said you're full of crap ... so we have no problem if you listen to the show where you you know we have no problem taking on\nA Republicans when they claimed to be conservative but they are not and so we invited all those people back then that should be between two thousand five and two thousand eight and we said look the Democrats takes it in two thousand eight we expect you to come back when they sky rocket the debt how many calls we have from Democrats in the eight years\nOn the debt on the deficit or eight years of Obama can't remember one zero\nYeah\nSo I mean that they have they have no credibility of that and and people don't care that's going to be ... more Republicans used to screen the debt and they realize people don't care now the Democrats are screaming debt and people don't care\nThey they they just don't I run a couple of things over the weekend where people are saying you got to understand the country has and I think I mentioned this last friday to this country is really going or we're really going right we're really going right we're really going right in some areas we are\n... physically were not\nNo not even a close eye on on economic issues we're moving to the left well and and the Republican Party is moving to the lab yeah and\nYou if you look at the uh the the the major threat from capital of the two capitalism and freedom more importantly a it is that that uh because if we're not going to if we don't care about it now then we're willing to let it go over the edge and at that point you can't turn back which means\nYou have government take over control of industry when industry goes south or if there's a program that goes south or you're going to have what\nAgain or imagine a scenario forget about cutting you know we talked about the whole hair cut thing you know to two percent five percent ten percent but the problem was is that now you can't talk about a one percent\nCut you can't talk about a one percent increase snow [laughter]\nYou can't you can't live with your increase to one percent\nSo there's there's just no way you would have\nRiots in the street remember in Europe when they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know there were they were talking about the especially like retirement benefits and everything else and the young people were writing\nThere were setting cars on fire how dare you take away all of our free stuff\nWell imagine you know an economy our size and we get to the point that we can't service that debt anymore well remember it was one open that door it was the jet I mind trick of\nBrock Obama as president but that's not a problem well today the the economy isn't collapsing but\nIt will then I compare to\nSaying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen and everything is fine\nOn an economics on on a tax cuts yeah the Republican Party is moving more conservative on on spending uh on on the on tariffs am I talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right\nA of a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half of the increase we talk about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending ... not\nNot the private market booming now half of it is the private market in preventing and we agree with that but we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you
