animal farm because I've I've told you I'm skeptical about the suspicious packages I have been since I read about them\nIn light of the fact that the young young army the marching army has suddenly been dropped from ... as seen on the sidelines because it backfired on the on the left wing so or if you've read animal farm you need to see the piece on how they exploit\nOr the the acts of violence against one of their own you have to understand how this works but I suspect that tomorrow God Forbid happens they may discovered traces of orange hair on some of the packages or they will say that the pipe bombs had\nThey been dusted from Princeton they found tiny little fingerprints on them\nAnd it leads right to the White House and they will make him complicit in the actual execution of this plot that's tomorrow\nSo what are they actually succeeded in doing so far look what we're talking about today\nWe're not talking about the marching army coming to America we're not talking about how to stop them\nWe're not talking about what it would do to our social services I Would overwhelm our hospitals instead we're talking about this and they draw on your eyes away from this caravan of humans and they are inspiring they're idiotic base to go out and vote and perhaps to commit violence\nI said it yesterday I'll say it again today there is reason to be skeptical as suspicious and to me this looks more like politics than pyrotechnics on Michael Savage I approve of what I think\nSo what do you think is the is the thing I don't have one left the sewers disagreeing with me you know\nWherever stuff come from all of a sudden ... what are they is there a demo is there a guy out there was in the military you see the picture on the Drudge Report the actual device you look at the front page is the only one as the picture from a one of the news outlets and it looks like a ah\nLooks like a the top of a wish broom little handle on and off for that which brings out of the top like that couldn't be my father he's been dead forty years so he didn't do it and there's some kind of device on it is there any what I'll do a good look at that picture and tell me what it actually is made of\nI I liked it a little bit more about the the pipe bomb\nWhat do you mean they hand delivered them with Secret Service that chapter car they got through the hand delivered and there's no surveillance photos and George Soros is the most hated man on the planet to the right wing movement even moderate conservatives noted evil man he is\nHe has no security cameras that would show us who put the bomb in his in his mailbox come on crazy I don't believe this not for a minute but I don't know maybe you're you're you buy it to me it looks like a hash tag thing they're going to have already\nThe only people who were real losers here are the Instagram slots like those Justin Bieber when in bikini types who every day they have to show them in a in a bikini like we never saw a woman before so tomorrow they'll have\nTo appear and say oh my God how do I stay an Instagram I have to show I received one too\nBut we all know that we don't want this to be real we're all glad that it's this is a a ploy\nBut if you missed the opening to the show you're not going to miss when I'm about to tell you again because I think I Hope I'm wrong\nI'm really wrong the left is going to find out that this failed as well the left is going to find out that even the left are skeptical of this little game that the writers even more cynical offer them the middle ground says I had enough of the left wing with their scare tactics\nAnd what's going to happen as they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they're liable actual send wants to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine where kill\nThat's I'm afraid of and who are they going to blame it on than most say well we don't know who did it we don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a scare monger and hate mongering that means you're looking in the mirror because it doesn't me\nMy book is so important for you because it ends with this statement from Ben Franklin indulge me for a minute I'm paraphrasing\nEither we all hang together or we will all hang separately I have been trying to tell America for a long time now\nThat there are peaceful ways of resolving conflict whether it's in your home in your head or or in politics and I don't see a Democratic Party willing to make peace

they're saying the right wing did it and yet subtle looking at the image of the a homemade bomb and they say there appears to be an ISIS logo on the bomb itself\nISIS flag and the bombs seem to have a similar logo and yet the left wing media is in overdrive saying they were sent by Trump voter and the ISIS flick complicates the narrative and then there are misspellings on the package itself\nThat's not a big deal I mean they misspelled Wasserman shows that's easy to do unless you're from Brooklyn and then you got John Brennan they left in and out of that so you know what does that mean so you

me like a whole made up story the whole thing\nSmells to high heaven and I love the main thing is we're not talking about the mob coming in on the south of the border we're not talking about what they

it\nVery heretic it burned at the stake thousands of others rose up and why was that because the inquisition killed his enemies in the open and killed them while they were still unrepentant in fact to kill them because they were unrepentant\nMen were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs naturally all the glory belong to the victim\nAnd all of a shame to the inquisitive who burned them later in the twentieth century there was a totalitarian ... there was a German Nazis and the Russian communists the Russians persecuted heresy more cruel lead on the inquisition have done and they imagine that\nAnd learn from the mistakes in the past they knew at any rate than one must not make them honors before they expose their victims to a public trial they deliberately set themselves

Honduras strapping strong young men and every day we're seeing at the march gets bigger the Democrats had it backfired blow up in their face you're talking about a bomb that bomb blew up as a Democrat face the bottom of the marchers\nNobody wants them here so what did they do I think this is a stunt that so I have to repeat this for you\nI ran into a woman from Hungary two weeks ago in the street\nWe got to ... she said to me that people are more afraid in America today to express themselves politically than they were under the Soviet ... and the Soviet times I said I Know that here in San Francisco people are all terrified is a small band the fanatical left a show on the newspaper\nAnd on the media and seemed to control everyone's thinking and it doesn't matter what the racist people are afraid to express themselves anywhere in the city I'm skeptical\nOf these devices did anyone listening to the show ever read a book in high school or college called animal farm because I've I've told you I'm skeptical about the suspicious packages I have been since I read about them\nIn light of the fact that the young young army the marching army has suddenly been dropped from seeing it on the sidelines because it backfired on the\nOn the left wing so if you've read animal farm you need to see the piece on how they exploit\nUh the the acts of violence against one of their own you have to understand how this works but I suspect that tomorrow God Forbid happens they may discovered traces of orange hair on some of the packages or they will say that the pipe bombs had\nThey been busted for print so they found a tiny little fingerprints on them\nAnd it leads right to the White House and they will make him complicit in the actual execution of this plot that's tomorrow so what do they actually succeeded in doing so far look what we're talking about today\nWe're not talking about the marching army coming to America we're not talking about how to stop them\nWe're not talking about what it would do to our social services I Would overwhelm our hospitals instead we're talking about this and they ...\nRuin your eyes away from this caravan of humans and they are inspiring they're idiotic base to go out and vote and perhaps to commit violence\nI said it yesterday I'll say it again today there is reason to be skeptical and suspicious and to me this looks more like politics than pyrotechnics on Michael Savage and I approve of what I think\nSo what do you think is the is the thing I don't have one left as soon as disagreeing with me you know\nWhere does stuff come from all of a sudden what are they is there a demo is there a guy out there was in the military you see the picture of the actual device looks like a the top of a wish broom\nWith the little handle on how far that ... out of the top like that couldn't be my father he's been dead forty years so he didn't do it and ah there's some kind of device on it is there anyone out there who could look at that picture and tell me what it actually is made of\nI I liked it a little bit more about the the pipe bomb or do you mean they hand delivered them with Secret Service at Chappaquiddick they got through the hand delivered and there's no surveillance photos and George Soros is the most hated man on the planet to the right wing movement even moderate conservatives noted evil man he is\nHe has no security cameras that would show us who put the bomb in his in his mailbox come on crazy I don't believe this not for a minute but I don't know maybe a year you buy it\nTo me it looks like a hash tag thing they're going to have already the only people who are in the real losers here are the Instagram slots\nLike those Justin Bieber in in bikini types who every day they have to show them them in a in a bikini like we never saw a woman before so tomorrow they'll have to appear and say oh my God how do I stay an Instagram I have to show I ever seen one too\nBut we all know that we don't want this to be real we're all glad that if this is a a ploy\nBut if you missed the opening to the show you're not going to miss one about the tide you again because I think I Hope I'm wrong\nI'm rarely are on the left is going to find out that this failed as well the left is going to find out that even the left are skeptical of this little game that the right is even more cynical over them middle ground says I had enough of the left wing with their scare tactics\nAnd what's going to happen is they're going to raise the stakes tomorrow the next day and I'm afraid that they are libel actual send wants to someone on the other side of the political spectrum and it will go off in Maine or kill that so I'm afraid of and who are they going to blame it on than most say well we don't know who did it\nWe don't know who did it now we don't know who did it but we're living in very dangerous times you know I got to take a deep breath and step back from here I don't even have a copy of my book stop mass hysteria but I remember\nThat the the book closes with a quote from Benjamin Franklin if you think that I'm a ... and ... that means you're looking in the mirror because it doesn't
