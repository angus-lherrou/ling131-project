than a hundred people to help me in the sun package it gets to a package was intercepted Monday crime addressed took hold in Atlanta headquarters FBI Director Chris Wray got part of the ... found so quickly because he left a trail of evidence for investigators to follow\nThey uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing and ... there is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected for pieces of two different IDs\nLet's say out loud ever detonated an after his arrest on friday he reportedly told official that he didn't want to hurt anyone but investigators probably devices were dangerous in Miami and the cost of caring\nSlaughtered by this make maniac Dylann Roof whether they were killed them shot them shame where these Jewish people were shot so what is it in the minds of these cowardly psychotic ... that they pick on the softest weakest targets\nTo make their the rank statements they're not going to arm people on the other side are they know they're always picking week defenseless people to attack\nSame way the Islamic murderers target defenseless people on a Sunday afternoon or whether it's on a bike path in New York or a nightclub\nIn Florida people having a good time always defenseless people to the logical conclusion is armed guards\nIf the people on on themselves then okay most people are afraid of guns by and large most people fear guns I've seen this my whole life I've heard people say I don't want a gun in my house and the answer is why well they're afraid they'll use it on themselves or they'll use it against the spouse in a moment of rage\nAnd then there are those of us who understand the difference between fear and reality and we understand that we have to protect ourselves in a society where you can't have a policeman in in every home\nAnd so we come back to the questions of the day what you should armed guards be placed in houses of worship absolutely no question about it just as we came to that conclusion with the school shootings were common sense would dictate that of course most schools have\nArmed guards around them but not to the progressive the regrets of mine is so blind to reality that no matter what the question is they always come up with the wrong answer I Want and they'll go to some of the callers lined for Jeff WABC welcome to the program what's on your mind\nTo Savage ah I'm actually a genocide seats here not too far from Pittsburgh and I wanted to call up and just tell you that you've been pretty fought on today I'm I've been teaching this for years\nWhen you have a society like our face that ideals like Bill of rights liberty that were free men and women and then you neglect that year after year after year you get to a point where we're at a post constitutional America and when you get to that point\nAnd you push people against the wall people revert to the ethno nationalism they reverse of this tribal it and it's disgusting and we have to stand with the Jewish community day for Pittsburgh around the world we have the same with all free men and women and we have to we have to remember that we're Americans we need to stick together um\nMy myself my brother and my ... my brother is active duty in the navy for father's a veteran and you know we we've seen that we see the flow pattern of the collapse of our constitutional order and we you know he had a ...\nOn how does the collapse of our constitutional order lead to a Nazi harm to the teeth slaughtering Jews who have nowhere to defend themselves how does how does that work\nFor the what I mean I'm Dr Savage and no disrespect to anyone in the in any community what what I'm saying is is that what binds us together as a nation was the fact that we believe that individual liberty and we believe and we believe any the rights of the individual and now we're we're the as we see these maniac\nEspecially the white nationalist movement you see this retrenchment into these tribes this tribalism that everyone in that group\nBut not but you're blaming white nationalist now all problems in America [noise] what about Louis power can just last week calling juice termites for what I'm saying is is\nThat no no no no let's let's not run over that I Know it makes people nervous Louis ... preached anti Jewish anti Semitism for ages last week he joked and mocked Jews and called them termites are you aware of that\nI was not I'm I\nI Will actually not why you're not aware of Louis ... hate speech which Twitter will not block the regime not aware of it is because the government in the media who are spreading hatred and lies won't even play the tape of lowest power can call in juice termites\nSo before you start saying it's the only white nationalist show the problem I think you need to look at the broader problem in our society\nI can I can fully agree with you I was using them as as for example um but but it's the it's the point my main point is that when you have a constitutional or or even take take take a terrible terrible for communism forget where you have I think\nWe're getting too far afield right now and I I Know look you're on the right side of things I trusted you know what you're talking about but I'm going to get the uh the wheel back in my hands and I need to take the ship of the Savage Nation back in my hands because I don't want to go into the constitution and the bill of rights that's not what we're talking about\nWe're talking about the fact that hatred is in the air spreading like a virus we're talking about the fact that the media is the host organism that is spreading the virus we're talking about the fact that without hatred\nThese entities wouldn't survive a week they wouldn't survive a week if they were told that they had to stop it it really took Jeff Zucker in a room\nAnd you said you stop you a merry and that's on CNN from spreading this hatred against white people against white nationalist because you just starring them up I'll tell you right now Jeff Zucker wouldn't change one\nWord coming out of a Andy bloopers mouth or any of the other characters that worked for him and the chorus line there's no common sense left there's no decency left in the media\nSo today I told you are I'm not going to write the whole ship of state but I Am talking about why it happened in the minds of the Mad Men without justifying explaining to different things\nUh sorrows backed group of regrets ... in Pittsburgh have the nerve to say the Trump don't come to Pittsburgh you're not wanted here\nSixteen thousand communists in a group called bend the are Jewish Action funded by Alexander Soros\nTens of thousands of quote regressive Jews\nAnd now they're rising up and solidarity against Donald Trump\nAnd the board of directors goes along with this do you have any idea what kind of anti Semitism stirs up in the country when the average person out there and they handle and says oh it's those Jews in Pittsburgh or don't want Trump there do you have any idea what damage progressive are doing to this they should\nThey should know that after the killing to stop it but they can't stop it\nBecause of liberalism is a serious mental disorder\nThe rabbi wants Trump there the rabbi wants Trump they make no mistake about it it's this group of mental event individuals funded by Soros the sun in this group bend the ... which is quite ironic bend the arc you hear bend the arc\nI Wonder how long it's been since any of them actually walk with an ark with a toe or from the arc and felt the power of those letters and the power of the books and Moses in those letters there's a magic in it by the way a power that you can imagine unless you actually have done it\n\nWhen you stand in front of those Hebrew letters even if you don't read them and you stare at them and you realize that for thousands of years these words of God have instructed mankind\nYou feel something that you can explain in other words there's no way to to explain that you see well anyway I I Want to move on I think I made my point\nSo what point do you want to make is the point\nWABC Liz line for here comes a hater go ahead ...
