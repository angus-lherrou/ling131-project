on the plantation can be counted upon through a push the communist agenda but wants a gay person or a minority goes off the plantation\nThey become open game to be haunted like animals look what they did the Clarence Thomas\nI Want to go to the issue of women and beauty it's a little obscure point\nWhen I was looking at the guidelines for beauty back in ancient Rome and look how things have changed I remember before I read this to you it's not directly related to anything it's just a little hope or even opening here\nBecause a mass hysteria is somewhat of a mixture of politics in the history listen to the guidelines for beauty and I remember before you listen to this and say wait a minute I agree with that I don't agree with that\nA beauty is a cultural thing different cultures liquor beauty in a different way I'm going to read you the standards for beauty in Rome and women are as the ticket and the time\nFirst of all they all live and they all order will have had\nThe Angelica look\nThey had to look in jail and so having to hand or dark skin was\nNot regarded as attractive and pure white skin\nA class in ancient Rome as a native ... women would not naturally have white skin they use the white shark lead or arsenic too it's in their faces\nLarge eyes with long eyelashes or also prized why did you know why large eyes with long eyelashes lashes what price did ancient Rome it\nWas believed that women's eyelashes fell out from excessive into costs so long eyelashes became a sign of chastity now you understand where some of these beauty secrets are still a operation that our society with fake eyelashes right wait a little more guidelines for beauty in ancient Rome\nHair was a function of beauty for men and women in ancient Rome so thick curly locks word mired most women would die their hair black red or blonde to emulate the lush textiles of the goddesses they would also where wigs any here and not on the head was seen as an attractive\nAnd remove the by plucking\nStripping or shaving\nNow here's something odd for those of you in America\nOr a modest ... very different today isn't it but small round breasts were actually admired far more than a larger ones large breast was seen as being humorous or a sign of old age in fact young Roman girls was so determined to have small brass\nThat they wore a kind of early ... in the form of a band\nA excessively tight to inhabit the growth of their breasts\nWhat was the ... the perfect child bearing figure in was in the little skinny girl of today with no hips at all\nBecause being thin was not regarded as an attractive trait in Rome with so much of a woman's life focused on rearing children wide hips were regarded as very attractive\nAnd all the men didn't like that women excessively large a plump from body was seen as the ideal type one more point about guidelines for beauty in this age of a women\nLess is more extravagance was frowned upon although wealthy women that sometimes wear jewels and necklaces anything more was viewed as showing off or being overly boastful a very negative trait attention a rap raps does out there\nAnd this is likely why almost all contemporary depictions of Roman goddesses are quite simple minimal and modest that's Roman women in mythology\nFrom not from mass hysteria but from a book I read all about history book of the Roman empire\nIt's fascinating to read about ancient civilization but now have you heard the phrase ... since I'm at the Capitol hearings Dr fraud was held up and made into a sacred leap your vessel virgin as you well know\nNever had ... and no one asked her about her background what she was like in high school or college because of the ... foot screen that that was somehow sex is to do so but I think that that is an important point I mean what was her background\nNow what is it ... mother was very important in ancient Rome and not going to read it to you because you can find it on your own in in in Roman mythology I'll just give you one hand\nYou have to go back to the story of ... and ... who is Ramy lesson who was ... well\nIt was a ... by the name Maria silver not an accused her of cabin or\nThere was a festival virgin name ria silver apparently ... he hasn't been able to find her yet who after being raped by the guard Mars gave birth to the founders of Rome name Rami lists and dream is that you know that well the rest is history\nAnd I give this to you to show you that what we're going through right now while not related to ancient Rome is related to history in many ways what Campbell Harris Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker\nShall I name all of them and the others on the committee are doing today is actually nothing new under the sun\nIt went on in the Soviet Union were all you have to do was denounced someone and their life was ruined\nIt went on in Hitler's Germany or you had to do was renounced someone and their life was ruined and they were imprisoned if not executed so the new left are actually the new right the new left or the new fascist as many have said but what we are witnessing and the average person certainly see through it\nIs unfounded accusations are not American it all in fact they're very on American which leads me to the house of on American activities committee of the Nineteen fifties\nHow many years where you left this lecture to about a Saturday McCarthy being a very bad man because she accused in some cases are falsely\nPeople in America mainly in the government in media and an academic of being communist or communist sympathizers right and we were told that was a false thing if it gets it ruin lives and McCarthy was set to be a bad man now let's put aside the fact that\nMost of the people that McCarthy out of this communist turns out to be communist as we learn in the Nineteen eighties wasn't even own a papers were released you'll have to research that even own a papers it confirmed it almost all of the people accused by senator McCarthy war in fact fellow travelers in communist but putting that aside\nHow many times have you been lectured by leftist professors\nThat McCarthy was a bad man\nThat McCarthyism which became synonymous with false accusations was an evil thing\nWe wake up and we see that Feinstein is now McCarthy only there's no troops there were allegations we see that every one of them on the committee or the new Soviet ... and I am only hoping that the fairness of the American people will shine through all of this mark\nAnd that Kavanaugh will be voted upon and approved however I Am not optimistic that will happen because I did some research on who Senator Flake is and you'll be shocked to find out that Senator Flake well appearing to be somewhat\nMiddle of the road is anything but I think the flight will vote against him no matter what the FBI says now remember this before we go on\nKavanaugh had at least three FBI investigations along the way to becoming a federal judge Iraq Obama had none in fact I said it when Obama became president he could not have passed an FBI background check and being an been an even ordinary\nFBI agent Obama could not have become an ordinary FBI agent because of his associations with very dangerous leftist including bill layers than others but he never was subjected to a background check\nDo you think Feinstein could pass a background check you think Cory Booker could pass a background check do you think capital Harris would welcome a background check do you think that turban Durban who called our US Marines Nazis in fascist could pass a background check\nI really wonder why we don't have an FBI background check of all of the new Soviet ...\nThis is Michael Savage author of stop mass hysteria\nJoined the Savage Nation coal no eight

the famed I've been lied about slandered over the years I've defended myself every time it I've won every case\nBut we're we're witnessing right now a form of defamation never before seen in American history perhaps since the Salem witch trials\nAnd in my book mass hysteria I have a chapter entitled from Salem to CNN how hysteria taught us doing that and that's the ties ourselves\nAnd I say we are at risk of returning to this medieval state as we allow the corrupted mainstream press agenda driven agitator to gain control of sections of the population\nThat I ask how is the nation's best interests or when the self serving New York race traitor Al Sharpton costs for federal the funding of the Jefferson Memorial well that was one example now here's a man who's background included\nVocal visible support for Fifteen year old to wanna Brawley\nFrom ... falls New York who in Nineteen eighty seven lied and claim she was raped by several white men police officers among them\nAl Sharpton was joined by those are the pillars of the black community the racist nation of Islam had Louis feral cat and that famed booster of women's rights Bill Cosby weld together with a complicit media they whipped up blind frenzy and mass hysteria all of it based on a lie\nTo water Brawley later converted to Islam change their name became a nurse and moved to Virginia though Sharpton lost all credibility for his rush to judgment he continues to do now what he did then spread mass hysteria that elevates them in the eyes of his community\nLike the inhabitants of seventeenth century villages

was slandered all live old would have paid in other words if someone's landers let us say public figure and that public figure by being the famed loses a position\nAnd loses their money or something

and he became\nLaw makes you so interested in the connection between Dr fraud and the CIA ... sorry I don't think you can hear me and what makes you interested in the connections between Dr fraud and

have been done about them\nBooks have been written about this kind of corruption remember I wrote a novel called abusive power set in San Francisco it was a New York times best seller you wouldn't know it would you call it abuse of power jak Hatfill was my character\nSo this is an old story kind of defamation and smear campaign and what's ironic here is that the left which was belly aching for

in America today you have a choice the Democrats or in this case hold your nose the Republicans\nI Want to talk for a minute on the Savage Nation about libel and slander better known in the broad category of defamation I'm a broadcaster who's been in the business twenty five years and I have been the famed I've been lied about slander and over the years I've defended myself every time it I Want every case\nBut we're we're witnessing right now a form of defamation never before seen in American history perhaps since the Salem witch trials\nAnd in my book mass hysteria I have a chapter titled from Salem to CNN how hysteria taught us too and that's and that's the ties ourselves\nAnd I say we are at risk of returning to this medieval state\nAs we allow the corrupted mainstream press agenda driven agitator to gain control of sections of the population\nThat I ask how is the nation's best interests or when the self serving New York race or Al Sharpton calls for federal the funding of the Jefferson Memorial well that was one example now here's a man who's background included\nVocal visible support for Fifteen year old to want to Brawley from ... falls New York who in Nineteen eighty seven lied and claimed she was raped by several white men police officers among them\nAl Sharpton was joined by those other pillars of the black community the racist nation of Islam had Louis ... and that famed booster of women's rights Bill Cosby well together with a complicit media they whipped up blind frenzy and mass hysteria all of it based on a lie\nTo water Brawley later converted to Islam changed your name became a nurse and moved to Virginia\nThough Sharpton lost all credibility Frist rush to judgment he continues to do now what he did then spread mass hysteria that elevates him in the eyes of his community\nLike the inhabitants of seventeenth century village is people hear him speak with authority about subjects in which he has absolutely no objectivity yet they cheer and following\nBut today it's mass hysteria raised against one of the towering figures of American history Thomas Jefferson\nToday's youth you see are the targets and cause of campus progressive ... children have always been victims of manipulation the testimony of children was used against the suppose it which is in Salem, Massachusetts\nChildren are the ones whose minds are being and that's the ties and destroyed by drugs including marijuana\nThroughout history those who perpetrated hysteria our immune from the consequences the essential question our nation has been forced to asked over and over and again today who is pulling the strings and why why we finally have the faces of those\nIn injecting America what these lies and this hysteria\nThe names are to be seen in plain English the defamation has to be seen by all Americans Dianne Feinstein\nCory Booker Camelot Harris shy name\nAll of them or you don't know who their names are so let's look at libel and slander if someone accuses you fall asleep and it causes you harm you ever civil remedy if those words end up causing harm to your reputation or your livelihood\nLibel is a written or published a ... or a statement was slander is defamation that has spoken by the defendant so you have to look at proven libel and slander I Would like to propose that anyone who slander as anyone in public even a public figure\nHas to pay the price in the paying the same penalty that the individual who was slandered ... would have paid in other words if someone's landers let us say public figure and that public figure by being the famed loses a position\nAnd loses their money or something like that a certain amount of money and then it turns out that there there was false spaced about false what's through the witch hunt\nThe individuals who slander libel that figure should have to pay the exact penalty that that individual would have paid had they been found guilty of such slander or ... what is wrong with that nothing so here's the problem the law itself as the ass\nThe law is an ass said the great great British essayist\nA Samuel Johnson and the Eighteen hundreds he said the law is an ass Shakespeare had some wonderful things to say about lawyers which I cannot repeat on this program but the fact of the matter is most lawyers as you well know are not at all in it for the truth\nThere into crucified people just take a look at the one who's representing all of these fake accusers one of the lowest scum to have ever received a law degree and areas on every television channel over and over and over

happening by accident\nAnd so I'm asking you these questions and telling you know lies trying to get it the truth and I don't know that anyone cares about the truth is is what I think this is what I'm

truth was until I came up with the true answer to a question about whether it's something I had done or not done\nOr something to that effect he wouldn't let me go he just wouldn't let it go it was drilled into me why does truth matter the truce matter in an age of media charades\nDoes truth matter in an age of fake news on both sides of the aisle tell me the truth really matter to you I'm asking you listen to your question I don't care if you're a ... a progressive or whatever you call yourself do you really care what the truth is or do you only care about getting your site to win that's really the issue is it just a team sport\nIf it is I'm Out tell me if anyone covered the fines thing China spy and how long they covered it for why they why did they brushed aside\nThe left does not even understand that they become very enemies of themselves\nHere's a story that's a little obscure dentists accused in Las Vegas resort case of rape have charges against them dropped say it's an ordinary case but it isn't\nCharges against for California dentist including three brothers accused of kidnapping by an unnamed woman who told security at the wind Las Vegas she was sexually assaulted in a suite while drunk\nAll three of them were brothers they are was said that they kidnapped and assaulted the woman and they said wait a minute no we never did that\nSo cell phone video showing that the allegations were completely made up were shown in court and the charges against these innocent men were dropped but what happens to the liar what happens to the rapists the woman who write their reputations\nWell the men themselves are acting real good they're saying well at the sensitive moments in our history we believe that women should be respected and hurt and believe it\nBut it's this case shows is also important to keep a critical on on those willing to use the me too movement\nFor their own selfish motives and remember that innocent until proven guilty\nIs one of our
