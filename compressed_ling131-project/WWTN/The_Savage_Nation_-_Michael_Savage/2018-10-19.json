uncovered this racism at Harvard a Harvard University dean testified that the school has different SAT score standards for prospective student's based on race and sex\nNow this trial was brought about by Asian American applicants who have said for years they being discriminated against at Harvard no kidding no kidding it's the same at Berkeley Princeton Gail all the rest of the two ships have lower living\nThere and let the best and brightest then not at all they discriminate against Asians and whites did you know that if they want to have diversity they want the catalog to look like an inner city\nWhat's important not whether the students to keep up with the learning not whether anybody can excel at Harvard or what matters is that the brochure or looks\nSo the Asians had it up to here and they decided to sue trial began Monday\nAnd all they heard from so far was the dean of Harvard\nAnd they learned that Harvard sends a recruitment letters to African American Native American and Hispanic high schoolers with only mid range SAT scores around eleven hundred on math\nAnd verbal combined that about possible sixteen hundred but if you're an Asian American you only get a recruitment letter if your score at least two hundred and fifty points higher that's Thirteen fifty for Asian women and Thirteen Eddie for men and the story\nBut the the liar\nWho runs it at Harvard says\nIt's not discrimination midst if it's him and said no no no there's not discrimination isn't\nOh no no no we still certain groups\nIn order to break the cycle and try to convince students to apply the hobbit who normally wouldn't send in the school yeah that's\nWhat I can sit at a school where a person can add they want them to consider the Harvard now they can add three columns for what they want them to apply to Harvard they're desperate to have them there why till I went to standards it yet\nThat's another topic for you now okay I've given some stories\nAnd if you're not interested in any of

what's the big deal OK you try to write a book\nShe if you make it into the top five thousand we made it into the top eleven now here's the interesting part the way the New York times calculates best sellers is they use their own algorithms\nIn essence my book is probably realistically number five or six but the way they raped things is very hard to figure out but we made it America's and Saturday from the Salem witch trials for the Trump which on\nAnd that's only the beginning of where we are going to go I think that this book once people actually read it and see that it's not just another derivative book\nSupporting Republican talking points which is what all the other books are they are all the river to books you know what that means the ribbon of asking musician what that means\nAsk

Thirteen ready for men if this doesn't tell you how important\nThe Republicans are for fairness in this country you know you don't have to like them on everything I told you if we got thirty percent of what Trump promised it'd be a hundred and thirty percent more than we get to get from Hillary Clinton should just try to imagine where we'd be in this country now\nIf she had one and think about

fact that we need to an even playing field\nAnd even playing field means Asians who are being discriminated against by Harvard and other so called Ivy League schools\nWill soon be able to\nRest

anymore or starts to burn and you can't take it or you can study anymore for that SAT or to cast study anymore for the outside or the cat suffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret that might get just ... right\nI say no don't get any special advantage either it's equal to every one of its not equal at all is that simple you know there's no such thing as a reverse racism\nThose words don't have any meaning either it's racism or it isn't racism so if you exclude Asians are whites because they're doing too well that's racism and you know I thank God the Asians finally sued this has been going on since Nineteen Seventy eight that's all\nSo I think we've covered that one for now I can do a lot more on it\nAnd it's interesting to me what people respond to one on Twitter or on the radio show or on my website we're talking about Lou Gehrig's disease because Stephen Hawking has died and he was considered a great girl about everything but\nReally wasn't and that will air on his last book you said God doesn't exist so on what he is he was an atheist at the end\nHe was a bitter broken man from his disease it's sad that in his disease he didn't find any faith\nI don't know how I Would be if I had that disease I Can't say but it doesn't mean that everything you said was gospel you understand what I'm saying so that launched us into the discussions have been having on the show and I went into the story of a a less as I said to you I was very interested in that in that back in the late seventies when I was working for my doctorate\nAnd I did some research on it and I continue to be interested in plants and toxins meaning\nShe she was living in an age of mass psychology of mess up notes on so many subjects including health and nutrition and health and disease so if I say to you that there are toxic and ... occurring a natural products that you have to be aware of people don't even know what I'm Talking about\nThis a mythology today amongst because of the mass psychology mess psychosis where people say if it's natural is good that's the stupidest thing you could ever think of\nI can give you a list of at least twenty to thirty natural compounds that can kill you instantly but you see the the re Mrs who think because they treat\nTheir brilliant on every subject wouldn't even understand what we're talking about what that I'll give you an example toxic against that occur in nature that that you should know about so let's go to South America to the jungles together for a minute so you see the indigenous people hunt monkeys and the trees and they use arrows tipped\nThat adept than cure Ari\nAnd they fire the arrow it's a monkey and the trade the arrow doesn't kill the monkey uh paralyzes the monkey biggest cure Ari will paralyze you or a monkey depending upon the dos\nAnd the monkey falls out of the tree while still alive and they take it back and kill it and cook it All right\nSo what's the point ... a natural product it can kill you\nHow about rice and we hear about rice and write well what's that from the castor bean plant the most potent natural toxin that I Know of is from the castor bean plant it's so potent that an infinitesimal amount can kill you\nSo you got to be very cautious about this statement that if it's natural it's good for you and this is part of the crowd psychology that I tried to talk about in stock mass hysteria\nLeaning back to politics again biggest mass hysteria ... hypnosis\nOr is something you have to understand because the media and governments exploit both\nMass hysteria and master if no ...\nFor example selling the absurd notion that Russia cost Hillary Clinton the election\nOr denying that France and England are crumbling under the weight of Muslim immigration\nOne of those statements is demonstrably untrue the under the other is demonstrably true you had those in denial refused to accept reality in either case this is what I mean when I talked about mass hysteria and it's all in my new book which is a must read for those of you can still think\nSo that we go back again to the uh other illness right now they're scaring people especially those with young children which is\nThe polio like illness a FM\nNow I happen to remember that a few years ago when Obama flooded America with Honduran women and the young children they brought in secret but I also remember railing against this insane policy because of the fact that ... the sixty eight and ... virus these sixty eight\nWas known to be endemic in Honduras why would you bring in children affected would they be the sixth grade and I expect them to call in fact children here and our schools unless you're a left wing mark just wants to destroy America and you want voters and you want this and you want that you don't care about the health of the nation okay\nSo if you try to find any relationship and the literature today between\n... any V. sixty eight\nOut of the outbreak of this polio like LSU wills I find it anymore in America it's gone from the literature because no one's funding the government won't fund that kind of relationship so listen to what I found for you\nI had to go and find scientists in China who are showing relationships between ... sixty eight okay and this new outbreak of polio\nBecause in China they have more freedom in science than we do here I'm telling you like it is\nShow there's a scientist that's associated with the Joint Center for infection an immunity in the ... Institute of pediatrics in the ...
