back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is and he's a great religious later and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got back here we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got back and he's going to be safe very shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office

but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise]\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty you know it was very sad and beautiful in one way and very sad and and the other kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she\nReally had a big impact on me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better than all they used to what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we called the ...\nPlus MCA and its works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with software\nSo how many jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we're talking about a million what\nYou're talking about millions of jobs potential forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and we have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country to the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed\nHow can we how can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they said millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair\nUh we met with them I told them I'm going to start taxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nMessage and data rates may apply please

thoughts\nWith you and uh I understand is going to happen a more frequently or over the year twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty which I could not encourage it imagine this country imagine some of the fallout\nAnd what about uh three weeks three weeks in a day or two if the Democrats take the Senate one consequence of that will be\nThere will not be any federal judges confirmed\nBy the U.S Senate over the next two years\nAnd won't happen and then if Trump is reelected and twenty twenty what'd you this point appears to be likely\nAnd the Senate stays democratic and twenty twenty they will not come from any federal judges for the next two years or for the next two years after that\nSo we're looking at possibly a six year timeframe that the Democrats take the Senate when there are no federal judges confirmed by the state Senate under Chuck Schumer\nThing about that and the impact that would have on your life in my life because CNN\nAnd the Democratic party and NBC ABC and CBS listening to Leslie stall on sixty minutes few hours ago there in a complete meltdown over the possibility that Trump could be reelected they're doing polling already encouraging Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders the run\nAnd I can dent in twenty sixteen the only Democrat that Trump could have beaten was Hillary Clinton every other one probably would have beaten the president\nAnd America would not be right now mourning in America revitalization a brand new American economy three point seven percent unemployment rate\nCrack down on the southern border we're new ... new trade deals with Canada and South Korea and Mexico the president just talked about with you and I we wouldn't have any of that stuff going on\nAnd so that's why three weeks in a day for now it is so important especially if you live in uh Ohio if you live in a if you live in Missouri if you live in North Dakota if you live in Florida if you live in Texas there's ... there's a few critical races\nThat will determine whether or not the Democratic party will investigate or whether the Republican Party will legislate\nJust think about two to six years and then no federal judge has confirmed anywhere if the Democratic party takes the U.S Senate they will shut down completely\nThey will not work with this president to get anything done including criminal justice reform\nReforming marijuana laws or whatever it might be the president is on the precipice and twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty of doing some great stuff and I do not believe I Do not believe the Democrats are necessarily going to take the house I Do not believe that the polling was so wrong and twenty six\nIt was a joke and so if the house in the Senate stay in Republican hands good stuff this is just the beginning on the other hand a wise man told me in Washington\nThat the first two years of the Trump presidency will be peaceful compared to the next two years if the Democrats take the house and or the Senate that what we're going through the past two years to fight coal and scream to move this country forward\nWill stop completely and there'll be investigation upon investigation and no legislation it'll be think Trump at all costs seeing the ss drunk and you know and I know so if you're in one of those contested congressional districts\nWhether it's California Texas Florida Ohio Colorado North Dakota wherever it is go out and vote Republican to keep\nThe house in the hands of ah the successor of Paul Ryan whoever it might be and especially if you're one of those five or six states that have a Senate race that is so competitive\nWhat like in Nevada or Arizona or North Dakota or Missouri even in Michigan Ohio Florida you've got to go out and vote imagine the world with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer completely in charge of the house in the Senate because at that point zero zilch NATO will get done\nCNN and et cetera is then to destroy Kanye West mode\nBecause the most loyal voters in America are black voters for the Democratic party and when African Americans figure out what the Democratic Party historically has done to them and not for them hopefully the Democratic party ... held a peg\nThanks to listen again I think not I think having the president on is always a great joy\nAlso Bill O'Reilly their book is killing the ss and of course diamond and so can I don't know how we equal or exceed this kind of show next Sunday night but the great American built Cunningham\nWill do my son just listening tonight and fleas urge you if you're in one of these contests that house districts are one of these

Sanchez reports from\nThe White House president has not explicitly blame Saudi Arabia he has sort of the White House is going to get to the bottom of what happened to the Washington Post columnist for the president has also shave status ingestion by some senators\nThat Congress should get involved specifically by potentially blocking a hundred billion dollar arms deal that the administration made with Saudi Arabia is something that President has said would likely hunting us more than it would hurt Saudi Arabia to return\nFrom a stronger military to weaken military to court for making laws which is what the left loves that's where there were so upset with the capital hearings they want judges to make the laws to courts interpreting and watch it seems to me that we're fighting for the soul of our country\nAnd there are signs it could be getting much more confrontational\nFrom the ... fascist to black lives matter we're free speech for those who disagree with is in jeopardy is no doubt in my mind that's what's going on by the way that was just such a battle Saturday between the conservative patriot prayer group and counter demonstrators from ...\nSo that when they get they got into a bloody battle outside of popular bar where members on both sides use beer spray\nMy producer a terrific producer Brian what's hairspray I don't even know what they're so I guess you use it against bears I said beer spray but its bears pray about maybe ... you know these guys route the bar\nAnd fists in Baton to beat each other and that's a great night police reported seeing both groups with hard knuckle gloves knives and firearms what they've done in the march flash march for law and order\nIn pi DX I think that's the name of the Portland airport or even in the city of Portland was organized by patriot leader Joey gift\nThan a response to Portland mayor ... wheelers oversight of the city's police department you may remember he doesn't want the police department to do anything most of the time that's what's great part of the problem\nSo in my opinion is preventing them from doing their job I bet you if you interviewed the police they would say the same thing hey just let us do our job we they can uh I Can't imagine that they like to see violence take place on either side but this is just one indication of how the nonviolent civil war he's turning violent\nAnd you're currently I Know you know this you certainly can't speak on college campuses without interruptions or the threat of violence if you're a conservative on college campuses that's not a problem for the left or liberals like to speak\nWhere the you know if you remember the free exchange of ideas was supposed to be the role of the day if you go to college campuses you'll often see that somewhere that they talk about truth and an exchange of ideas that's not taking place anymore and of course now you can't even go to a restaurant or have privacy in your home\nIf you're on the conservative side of an issue in the opposite side recognize you or knows where you live they were giving out one guy right he was arrested last week the giving out phone numbers of various senators and addresses and he does on the government computer\nAnd just this past week the state Republican Party headquarters in New York was vandalized they smash windows and spray painted the doors with anarchy symbols\nAnd left behind in the building read that the attack was putting the Republican Party on notice mentioned as they continue this quote heart attack is merely a beginning we're not pass if we are not civil and we will not apologize uh-huh unquote\nBy the way maybe they were following up on Hillary's remarks did you hear what she said this week where she said Democrats can't be civil with Republicans during Donald Trump's presents I Wonder what would have happened if she had one\nAnd Republicans said the same thing we certainly can't be civil until Hillary Clinton's term is over ... of course get it if you wear a make America had ... anywhere you're you're in danger in jeopardy I mean it's amazing what's going on out there\nYou may be putting your life in danger and even putting a sign in your yard or on your car risks great property damage\nBut it may even be getting worse than that would the shootings have congressmen so what was about a year ago who serious injuries the Steve ... ... who could have been murdered and of course on an order Asian day from the very beginning\nI forget which actress or sing or whatever was I don't fault those people there was a threat to blow up the White House or worse you know I remember that and Senator Rand Paul said recently he voiced fears about possible deadly force being used\nAnd who can say for sure that he's wrong seven it's going to happen if this continues at something like that is going to happen\nThe left and the Democrats and the media which kind of resolve seems like these days the means not supposed to be like that but it sure seems to me that they're on the left they can't accept the fact that President Trump won the resistance of you know that's what they call it started before he was even president\nAnd there may have been we're finding out now a soft coup against him to remove him from office more and more information is coming out about that but by the way we wouldn't have smarts to find out the information Hillary is supposed to win and Obama said she was going to win and there was no reason that she wouldn't when\nWe went and found out about any of the stuff that that makes me think like a banana republic\nBut there were those in this country that we're ready to overthrow the will of the people in whatever fashion they could so in my opinion that was the beginning of the civil war may have started before that but that with what's been going on President Trump\nTo overthrow sitting president to go against the will of the people just because you don't like the results let's let first is right and it continues they hate President Trump's so much\nThat anything goes because they have truth on their side they can't imagine this was a shock then when I say it on other shows\nThat there probably an equal number of people that were devastated by the election of President Obama I Do for many resistance but I got to be honest I I like to count the days okay this year is over you know all you have three more years left of him\nBut that I didn't never occurs to them because they're so arrogant to begin with\nSo I Want you tell me if you agree with me how bad things have gotten

Trump's win but the hatred for him knows no limits\nPart of it I'm sure is what they regard as unsophisticated behavior in a good part of it is his personality which can easily alienate people I knowledge that he's difficult sometimes especially with the things he says he often says things you shouldn't especially on Twitter and he picks fights where they should be not\nHe demeans the White House see I'm being honest by answering some of his outrageous critics and he's clearly incapable of accepting much of any criticism I get that oh a few of us are\nBut the spy his personal shirt

Robert in San Antonio you're on with mark Hi Robert\n... good ... a good evening I Believe you're completely correct when you say that the left 'cause uh convince themselves they're good and the right as bad\nI Wonder when you can correct me if I'm wrong but I Wonder if the right uh you know sort of copying their civil war language can be dangerous I Know I'm twenty five and are just getting off the coast campus\nUm the younger right we is a really um [noise]\nThey're they're in love with this idea of you know not your grand puppies GOP so they they're really getting going along with the idea of launching back against the left but I Wonder if our energy should be more focused on convincing the left that it's not this um this good versus evil that they probably don't even they can read justified in their world you\nYeah I don't think you can convince the hardcore left it there was no talk in them and you'll find out there maybe some independence you can reach maybe some of the Democrats I used to do a show in Los Angeles where I had two Democrats two Republicans on every week\nAnd those kinds of people you could convince and by the way there's a you can almost distinguish the left from liberals liberals used to be like Alan Dershowitz where if you disagreed with people you know you followed it through the ideas and and the ballot box what the left or people like the antifa groups\nUm where they won't even let you speak ... near the new fascists even though the accuser enemies are being fashion so I don't think there's any talk in the left if that's what you meant\nBut I Do think there's great middle that you might be able to reach and even some perhaps conservative Democrats are and that's true of our ...\nI bet you to the hardcore conservatives right wing conservatives you're probably not going to change their minds what you try to do in a reason fashioned people who are open to it have you met people at school that you can talk to as opposed to some you can't\nAh no no not not at all so you can't talk to them at all [laughter] oh no yeah no ... yeah they've they've completely censored who they want to\nUm you know I I I get what you're saying yeah your your friends on your side [noise] yeah I mean\nAh you know like a young Republicans group\nRight and it's you know their neighbors that hundred and one yeah how about your professors and teachers on camps and you don't have to say where you go\nYeah no that that's a pretty it's pretty left leaning to you can't really get a word in and then when you do it's just kind of a shame fest\nYeah pretty discouraging uh what's going on on the campuses especially you can never hear conservative speaker they won't let them talk my right\nOh yeah no you're absolutely correct\nYeah so I think you have to join the organizations you do so you don't feel alone and trying to work on people you can how about your family how do they feel that they didn't think did they think you're right see\nNo not at all your thankfully I grew up in the Christian also so probably a pretty level headed\nYeah well I I Would suggest to that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the facts many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think to me the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated in in what went on there the idea that allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is that race is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven guilty he was guilty just because he was accused of it\nAnd so maybe that influence on people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections but Robert I I think of your call and hang in there okay\nThank you thank you very much twenty five there so let's go to a\nOkay David you think people are voting were or dead huh God David in Cedar Rapids OK\nI'm OK what it is is that a ... father and my mother and my grandmother cell
