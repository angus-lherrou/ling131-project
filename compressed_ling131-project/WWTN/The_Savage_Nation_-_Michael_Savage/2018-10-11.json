Amtrak too adjusted service the Florida for the safety of its passengers on employees from bill Michael Amtrak\nSilver star trains traveling from New York to Miami well operate from Miami to Jacksonville, Florida the all metal line which runs between New York in Savannah Georgia will only operate trains between New York and Washington Amtrak is waiving fees for passengers who change their reservation\nAnd so this went on and he ran for the presidency as I said\nThe socialism thing is nothing new\nSocialism and the United states began with utopian communities in the early Nineteen century such as the shakers oh yeah labor activists usually British German or Jewish immigrants founded the socialist labor party\nThat's our departure point Bernie Sanders is the spawn of the socialist labor party or Eighteen Seventy seven he's an offshoot of that in my estimation\nAnd here he is back again combining the rhetoric of the socialist party of that era with the Communist Party USA or the Nineteen sixties\nAnd they're using the ... of white privilege even though there most of them are white\nAnd doing very well in the Bernie made over a million dollars last year I was there was co watching CNN and others in the media they all complain that America's a in a an inequality in action of inequality and they want to remake the global order now you're seeing there praising China\nAnd the next sound bite of this very evil dangerous man again he's entitled to his opinion and he's entitled to speak his opinion until it results in violence at which point he has a committing a crime just as in my opinion Maxine Waters has already crossed that line\nBy telling them off to go out an attack people in gas stations oh she didn't say a taxi said make them unwelcome well they're making people feel unwelcome in the streets of port living in Washington DC aren't they that's called a subtle way of saying go out and attack them\nAnd so far there's been no reaction we're all sitting here wondering when in that how are we going to fight back\nWhen the hell is the tax paying middle class person white black Asian gay straight when are we going to fight back\nWe get a city like passes letting these Mars disrupt us in gas stations in restaurants in supermarkets and department stores\nOr are we going to fight back and how do we fight back well first we need the knowledge to fight back that's number one number two we need to know the law and number three we need to know how to defend ourselves within the confines of the law since ... living in a relatively we're living in a relatively low all this time\nThe hands of the police have been tied\nAs I said to you in the last hour it started with a straight years of an artillery barrage from Morocco bomber and Eric Holder who attacked a police mercilessly eight straight years\nNot only that but they took every ... left wing lawyer they could find at NYU and Colombia and sent them out to every police department that they could get their little dirty hands into and put them in a so called monitors here in Oakland, California there's been a monitor watching every move the very top\nAs a result this total advocate the police are afraid to do anything would you blame them that's exactly what holder and Obama wanted they wanted the gangs to run wild in the streets\nAnd so here we set trying to conduct lives go about our business be left alone but we can't they won't leave us alone in fact that's part of the dictates of the Communist Party usa they even scream as long as summer uncomfortable you will be uncomfortable\nAnd then they call you a white supremacist if you speak up to them things of that nature so what is your defense again\nI'm telling you right now including all of your pompous little liberals here in the San Francisco area who think that you're going to enjoy your shape and he says forever\nOr you left wing losers in the bay area I think you're above it all especially those of you over there on the Oakland Berkeley complex you think you could sit and smear it every body and go about your business that somehow even though you're worth a fortune through inheritance\nOr through hard work us through luck\nThat you're going to continue enjoy yourself and that the mobs that you'll have encouraged will only attack your political enemies you I'm mistaken\nUs mistaken because the guillotine is a two edged sword and as I said to you earlier and on and on and on his eye proven mass hysteria which is a book even your liberals must read if you want to educate yourself as to a rational balanced middle road\nBecause it's a history book\nOnce they get what team started to fall during the French Revolution and killed every ... account the revolutionary they could find\nThat shop to head off every counter revolutionary they could find\nDid the guillotine stopped falling\nNo it was a Thursday blade a thirst it for more blood and so what happened next is what happened then Castro's Cuba\nIs what happened and Bolshevik Russia it's what happened in communist China soon the guillotine was dropped on the enemies of the revolution with in the revolutionaries who started to fight with each other for power it was a pure power struggle then they started to kill each other\nBut again the blade was still thirsty\nYou understand what happens when a when a revolution has unleashed on a nation look at Syria how many years of this been going on that was a revolution that was a civil war has not ended yet has if that's what you want in America over there and the shape in these hills of the East Bay that is what you're going to have\nAnd I call for middle ground I called for calm\nThat doesn't mean power that that doesn't mean run from them I mean stand up to them as I Do every day on this radio show do you know a chance as I take doing this do you have any idea what chances I take both personally and commercially to speak to you\nWith the education the educated opinions that I gave you based on history based on politics based on fact you any idea what it takes to do this to navigate the waters I Am and\nI Hope you do because now it's up to you now it's up to you I passed the baton to my listeners and I give you the best I can give you every day on the show and I offer you a written form of it and stop mass hysteria

not see Michael Savage on any TV station on any new show on any politics show on any discussion of books when I Am the\nNumber one best selling author in the San Francisco bay area and my books are not mentioned\nI Am the only met a member of the America of the media here in the San Francisco area who ever broke out nationally to the extent that I have and yet I Am completely ignored in this area because it doesn't meet the protocols of the lives of communism if you think I'm making this up I pity you it means you're an ignorant person\nWell I Want to continue when I come back with a little more of the most dangerous man in American history and American political I'm an American political world right now Bernie Sanders and I think actually before I take the brake Clint we have to play the soundbite\nWhere he declares all those of us who are taxpayers and want law and order members of an authoritarian access listen to what this evil man says next and oh three\nWhile we all thought the jury an access if committed that tearing down a post World war two global auto that they see as limited their access the power and wealth is not good enough for us the simply defend that order as it exists\nWe must look honestly at how the author has failed to deliver on many of us hummus is how often are Syrians have deathly exploited those failures in order to stop ...\nActually listen to the man he's an idiot on top of it all everything that the communist the promise Donald Trump has delivered\nNever has the society had a greater sense of wellbeing economically than we do now\nEverything that the left promises and cannot deliver has been delivered through naked capitalism\nEverything as Lulu was that was bad shoes ugly teeth and a failed or I Can't even say it but his wife is a woman who was under the gun right now for having the fraud at the college that she ran Oh yes you haven't seen that on the the Wolf Blitzer brigades have you\nTake a look at Bernie Sanders

these well presidential election and we're going to talk about socialism communism and out of the street riots are being whipped up by these leaders such as Bernie Sanders and others in fact Hillary Clinton today as you'll hear\nTells us to no longer be several he tells he tells the mobs we no longer and should not have a civil society so where does that leave us\nIt leaves us with the police\nIt leaves us with the men and women of law enforcement they are the only bury a we have between us and the mobs\nAnd stop mass hysteria you heard me right is dedicated to the men and women of law enforcement who are on the front lines protecting the rest of us from the violent radical left wing street criminals who as a who's goal is the terror society into pieces that's the dedication to my book\nAnd I have asked those of you\nWho believe in the police and believe in my message and the bigger message pleased by a copy of this book and give it to a local policemen or a local police precinct show them that you care and so my motto is donated copy to a cop I realize it's an uphill battle\nAnd to get some attention in the media today I Know that seven books came out yesterday so we have an uphill battle to get our message across in a very short window with that and we'll talk about what we have to do\nTo stop the communists from taking over our society which leads me to the main question of the day\nIf you are attacked or harassed by left us as we see going on in this country whether it be congressmen senators in Washington DC restaurants or in hallways or in Portland, Oregon where a bunch of black lives matter thugs took over the streets\nAnd directed traffic illegally while a cop stood by in Portland on a motorcycle doing nothing what would you do\nWhat are you allowed to do if you're in a restaurant with your wife let's say\nI'm Talking to you the whites of America because you're being targeted make no mistake about it this is all aimed at whites in America is a race war it's a class war and is being conducted naked Lee in this nation you listen to the rhetoric and don't accuse me of making anything up\nBecause when they were screaming at the people in the streets of Portland directing traffic these dogs\nWhat did they say get out get off the street Whitey you're an old weak Whitey get off the street Whitey they have whipped up\nThe wins the Nancy Pelosi telling everyone to be a disruptor and now we are all facing the world when that I don't mean hurricane Michael so I'm going to ask you a simple question what can you do within the confines of the law if you are sitting at a restaurant\nAnd the group of these dogs come up to you and try to chase you out of a restaurant what are your rights\nYou know where this is going to go because I Know where this is going to go\nFirst of all in California pepper spray is legal\nSo if you live in California and you are a conservative and you want to talk about your politics over dinner which is you are right in America and some thug call some thug\nBy Instagram to come there and harassed you you warn them that you will protect yourself if they do not get out of your face that you feel threatened\nNow what's gonna happen here is that every restaurant that America is going to have to hire security guards that is where this is going\nBecause the liability here is in the restaurant by the way you have a right if you are seated in a restaurant to have a piece a peace symbol dinner peaceful dinner you're allowed to sit there and eat your customer\nAt a restaurant has the right to refuse the service to anyone by the way\nSo they have an obligation to protect you so it's the same applies in any place of business\nUh what's her name Maxine Waters the hater has been screaming for months if you see them in a department store if you see them at a gas station chased them chase them harassed them she is committing crimes by doing so that's not free speech if you cross state lines\nTo foment a riot you're violating several federal laws at once Maxine Waters belongs in prison for what she has been doing but we are cowards your afraid to go near her for fear that would be called a racist but what are you gonna do if you're in a filling station\nAnd let us say one of these groups sees you I don't know where the magma had in the back of your car or stop mass hysteria book on your seat and they come up and start screaming at you what are you legally allowed to do to protect yourself\nNow you're not seeing the book anywhere which is very sad truthfully because if ever there was a book that is on time you just stop mass hysteria\nYet people in the media said to me well we don't want to run because there's really no hysteria out there know hysteria out there there's no news handle for stock mass hysteria or why don't you listen to the following montage and tell me if you think there was a news handle for stop mass hysteria\nHolidays try during my years

there's no news handled through the book stop mass hysteria that's why they're not running it on Fox News because there's no connection to the news is that is a connection to a cookbook or to a
