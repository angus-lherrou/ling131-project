Caesar say August facing five federal crimes in connection with the more than a dozen package bombs send to critics of President Trump the FBI Director made it clear that the packages contain improvised explosive devices and the bombs were no hopes\nThe ex pats has been unraveling since his arrest revealing a dark history of at least nine of rats including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nSoros and all of the others that he targeted I'm not blaming them but I'm telling you that it's very easy to hate them for what they've been saying about this country\nEspecially those who've been screaming yes let the whole world into the station if you're a poor guy on the bottom who's living on scraps and Europe party that wants millions of people that come into the country you might also snapped\nNow how can you drive around with that van and not be hassled by Democrats who have harassed people for a lot less just wear a magazine that you'll get harassed in this country how could he have driven around in that car without any cameras tipping anyone off how can you drive a van legally with all of those\nAnd those covered can you say for sure with a hundred percent certainty that he's not passing\nWhy would a supporter of Trump and they registered Republican commit such an act right before the midterm elections let me repeat that that line why would an avid supporter of Trump and they registered Republican\nCommit such an act right before the midterm elections why would he sabotaged his own party when they were running so strongly\nThe motive is a rational and usually acts of terrorism are committed when there's a sense of the feeder desperation\nRepublicans in trumpet doing well right now why would you send these packages now\nWhy kicked the left when they already down they fail or taking down Brett Kavanaugh they failed or gaining support for the migrant caravan the timing of this lone wolf mail bomb suspect is odd irrational\nBut he does have a social media presence of supporting Trump for the Republicans he does have a criminal record there is violence in his past these are things that cannot be denied and so while we entertained the possibility of a false flag earlier in the week\nWe left open the possibility that there was a real Trump's supporting ... wearing person who would be found to have done this in regardless this was a disaster for the Republicans in Trump no matter how this may turn out right now the left wing media\nAnd the left wing politicians or for open borders and anti America will go all out on a full frontal assault on us patriots on Donald Trump\nThis would be worth millions if these were political ads riding themselves and that's just what happened the media will now use their power to go full negative on anything patriotic anything Trump supported they just got their blue wave\nOr do you think I'm wrong do you think Trump is finished as a politician because of this do you think the Republicans are finished in this election I'm going to open it up to you as I continue to give you a news about this man because I found some things that are worth disclosing I don't think you've seen yet\nThe phone number is eight five five four hundred seven to eight to eight five five four hundred Savage\nOn a website entitled a heavy dot com which I linked on Michael Savage dot com we see statements about him he's a registered Republican his family was involved in fighting the Communist Party of the Philippines so it's in his DNA\nLet's see uh what else did they say that you haven't heard yet everybody knows everything we know about body building not he likes scantily clad women worked in a strip club as a bouncer\nHe claims to be a booking agent was seminal hard rock live claims to study prevent Madison number of our college in Florida claims to studying business at UNC Charlotte we don't know any of this we do know there's a little history of his arrests in the past and we have that for you on the Savage Nation\nTwo thousand and let's go back to Nineteen Ninety One convicted of a grand theft given two years' probation and paid sixteen hundred and twelve dollars Ninety Ninety two the bomber was arrested in Miami Dade for shoplifting\nNinety for his spouse accused of domestic abuse the civil filing for rest of the twice for possession seller steroids oh nine arrested on the criminal traffic violation for driving without a license\nFourteen was arrested in Miami Dade for shoplifting\nTwenty Fifteen arrested in West Palm Beach for shoplifting to Walmart light said he grabbed a ... a rolling briefcase and luggage bag or fifty eight dollars and tried to leave the store without paying\nSo uh [noise] there's enough here for everybody\nWhichever side you're on you can take your side now with some justification but the biggest when as you are going to be the anti American communists who are for open borders and hate Donald Trump\nAnd for those of you on the other side I guess you could always say but but but wait he's only one one thousand twenty fourth Republican\nAgain at the end of the day he has a lone wolf and he's an impotent nut and thank God nobody was hurt I open it up to the callers are they five five\nFour hundred Savage eight five five four hundred seven to eight two people are saying this why are the stickers on his van not faded they look brand new\nBroward County is a major Democrat area of the car would have been vandalized immediately number three in a van would more than likely be illegal to drive it would have been pulled over immediately and they say there are so many things wrong with this picture please use your mind and think\nAnother caller says ... using mail strip her was able to mail bombs to the U.S postal service directly to the home addresses of an international villain and Secret Service protected politicians writes all of his missing is his moment\nYou know people are asking these questions why as they know domestic terror threat driving around in a totally obscured van arousing no suspicion I can drive without sirens lights and the cop yelling at me through a megaphone if I even have a broken tail light for five minutes\nNow he looked up Florida law\nWhich says no person shall drive any motor vehicle with any sign post there are other non transparent material up on the front windshield okay side wings or side are real windows\nOf such a vehicle which materially ups trucks obscures or in pairs the drivers clear view of the highway or any intersecting highway if you will look at the suspects van you will see that his side in Rio windows are completely obscured with Trump related paraphernalia\nWhen when they apply to the windows\nWere they in a CIA crime lab and FBI crime lab\nOr is it really this guy how can you drive around like that without being pulled over I Know I look here's the thing there's something in this for everyone does have you on the Republican side of it are you going to say it looks like a phony set up it looks like he's the patch the like you said there would be yesterday you're right you're going to say I remember what I said where's the ... areas right\nWell here's ... well we got him now now if a Jack Ruby appears before he makes a statement will know it's a complete Fager\nLet's pray to God there's no Jack Ruby that's also going to be released from a lab somewhere some training lab\nNow having said that on the other side they're convinced that your all nuts like him\nRemember I Want you to see the world through the eyes of an Upper East side New York a liberal I Want you to imagine what it's like to wake up and immediately reach for your anti depressant and you're anti psychotic medication that's even before you brush your teeth\nYou then do a speed dial your psychiatrist that confirmed the the appointment or later that morning\nUse that immediately turn on the news and you start raging then you have your minute of hate against Donald Trump\nLater on in the day you turn on Michael Savage again you get your minute of rage minute of hate\nYou listen to me and you have another minute of hey do you have any idea what this does to them deal with any idea what an Upper East side lackadaisical left wing fanatic is saying today do you realize that breaking out their uh their their medication today they're going to celebrate their gonna share match tonight\nI mean they don't drink we know that's dangerous they're going to share their meds over a lot to be before it before the ... the sun is setting today there's gonna be mad sharing latte party tonight somewhere in New York City all around the city they're gonna break open that bottles of ah of whatever the medication is used for psychosis I don't even know what used today\nSo there's enough to go around for both sides and I would be remiss because no one else will do it to say to you if he does not represent\nClearly represent what mass hysteria is on both sides I'd like to know who does the man is walking example of America\nAnd if you think he is alone and having been triggered by George Soros Hillary Clinton and all of the left wing fanatics and America haters your mistaken and there's a lot more like him out there who are much more dangerous than him and I'll let that hang in the air\nJoy those Savage Nation coal no eight by by four hundred and seven eight bucks for for Hubbard seven to eight to salvage\nSavage Nation is

the thing I don't like about\n... because that's because I'm too real I mean you want me to level with you OK or you don't have to agree with my politics to understand that I'm In New York than anyone in New York\nFall I just wanted to let you know like I hate when\nI went when before you go what are you going to listen to me a as a podcast or in January because you can find\nA way it's free you'll see once it happens ... can put a notice out next week for you to do is go to Michael Savage got comments hit one button that goes to seven different sites for it and so you'll be able to get the show anyway whether the show is broadcast\nOn the station and I was almost irrelevant [noise]\nI I Wish it was on a New York I have nothing to do with it that they want or somebody a little less forceful than me I guess what what was your main point David\nFive point as a are just going to make a point about the ban is that your question authority right but you always do for all law enforcement I've\nOnly got away with him I always ... for law enforcement how about when the cops beat up that girl in New Jersey where it was eye on that on that story I'm not always pro law enforcement how about when they choke that big black guy to death in Staten Island which side was eye on them\nI don't I don't remember\nWell I was on the side of the guy who got choked to death at that time so don't say I'm always pro law enforcement there are real cops just as there's rogue everything else\nFair enough can\nI tell you I'm not a Republican though I don't care if you are\nOkay I don't like people imposing their morality on me if I Want to smoke a joint okay that's not up to the government to tell me what I can put in my own\nVia understand your classic American freedom loving man and your assumption is that Republicans want to tell you how to live your life and it's an easy assumption to make\nBut the actually the reverse is generally true it's the Democrats who run the nanny state who tell you what to think what to eat what to breed whether he was a plastic straw they had the opposite of the free market Republicans who leave it up to the marketplace so in the purest form you're probably a more conservative person then you may imagine\nI Know you're a Christian man and I understand that but I don't want\nIt well I'm not a Christian man I'm Jewish by birth and I practice or my faith which is largely that of a worshipping God and uh so you probably don't believe in anything right\nFor them to say that that I just don't like people vote in or out you know what I mean well no\nI don't think anybody does I certainly don't want a bunch of stuffy old men telling me what I can do with my body\nActually does does that make me a leftist feminist\n[noise] what about the law and order thing with Trump I mean it's just it's only about law and order law and\nOrder a well I Want more law and more order\nI absolutely you don't want the streets to be safer in New York\nFor ... they are much safer you know New York was back in the day\nWell I'm uh no I'm Sorry it's not as safe as it could be if the cops were unable to stop people in advance who are running around about to break into a store punch someone in the face you know let's not mince words yeah we know what's going on in that city walk a lot of it's not even being reported\nThe cop should have the right to detain someone in advance of that crime not after the body bag is on the ground\n[noise] All right\nYou don't you don't read do you do your choice non joking do you read books [noise] I'll send you stop mass hysteria if you want it [noise] yeah Oh absolutely check it out\nOkay I'll be coming into playing ground rapper so your wife or girlfriend is not offended that opens up one last thing\nAt least he's got a good sense of Yuma and by the way he saying something that most people that I Know say the same thing I Know conservatives who don't want anyone telling them what to do with their body nor are imposing their morality they actually detest the influence of religion upon their their lives they don't like it\nThey think it's their individual choice in their right they don't want the pope dictating what they can do and not do if you know what I'm saying\nOr ... or such so look the big story today\nIs the sigh of relief in America on both sides by the way everyone signed with relief that no one got hurt let let's for one second all settled back\nCan we all say we're happy that we can side with relief now that this lone wolf nut was found that he wasn't more dangerous than he was an impotent man\nThis is impotence the devices they sent according to the best information we can get we're all fake\nThey couldn't even be detonated we don't even know what's in them to this to this minute\nWhat's laughable is that everyone in the Democrats' side wants to be somebody is claiming they got on\nThere now announcing new ones are being found all across because if you didn't get one you're not on the list you don't qualify to even be ... you have to meet you have to receive one of these now to be a serious Democrat you understand that if you didn't get one you you're just not in the not in the in crowd I'm expecting more and more and more to be announced they are very soon\nSo a look and you can laugh at it if you want the human human condition is laughable and a certain way no one got hurt all of a kind of an input of not weightlifting store uses steroid user was arrested\nWe can all settled down we can all agree thank God nobody got hurt so that's it now what now what do we do we go on where it would be for the left still thinks the right look like him act like him\nAnd the rights still things to the left as insane and suicidal because of their positions on open borders a on a leniency towards criminals there a constant constant attacks upon patriots and so I don't know that the battle lines have not been\nI think the battle lines or justice drawn as they were before this event to you and how will that affect the midterms is going to change your vote there's certainly Democrats are not going to change their vote but I'm going to ask you

five\nNumber when I was reading Michael because Nashville leaves the voice we're here we're talking Nineteen Ninety seven WGN\nAll right Lee the image of a Trump super fan\nSo that makes the left feel superior he's sort of a dummy you use of steroids and he's a weightlifter muscle ... a loser makes the money so everyone who has a little something on the left feel superior to him right out of central casting\nAnd uh then the van Fitch the the picture it's not a new car it's not like a are there for like a Subaru with the happy couple you know a with a ride on you know you know the answer or do you have to have one of those cool cars\nThat goes to a clip side every day for another tempting experience\nThe whole thing doesn't look right you know I mean I'm a I'm a skeptic I've been skeptical since I'm a young guy and I\nI don't like the picture yesterday I Do I think he could have been the one yeah and he's the type shore if it's the image which is why I don't think you may have been alone or did it on his own I don't how many get from could tone in New York\nChewed a Wasserman Schultz in California all in one day in that van honey get did he get around to drive the country back I mean there's not even a there's no like dirt on the car just willy male looking well there'll be stupidity Marilyn how come the stamps Warren post marked\n[laughter]\nAre we not allowed to ask the questions because some of police satisfy these questions for me so let's get past all of this because I don't think we're gonna hear much more about this and I pray to God there's no Jack Ruby in central casting waiting to pop up any minute now\nIf you're an independent and that's my audience my audience was largely independence Republicans listen to a certain extent\nI get a lot of a left wing is listed in the bay area and even I Would say some markets around the country because they don't get anyone who triggers their thinking and I remind them someone in their family who doesn't talk to them anymore because they're so big it at least they got a chance to listen to this opinion\nOf mine and then they make up their own decision no one's mines are generally changed at this point a dose generally make up their minds they're almost impossible to change\nBut if you're an independent and you haven't made up your mind for the election has this little experience with the bomber story changed your mind will just impact your voting in just a few days K. F. A. Y. radio Jeff on line three is this going to change your mind in any way\nAverage I prior to this year I consider myself an independent ... down this year for the rhetoric that's been out there I'm voting straight Republican ticket than I Am today reassures me sit on doing the right thing and watching the channels they continue to do or say that Donald Trump thanks to apologize for\nWhat oh is that what they're saying they'll also now it's his fault [noise] oh yeah yeah\nNo I Would say it's their fault for triggering this poor man\nThat I I agree one hundred percent\nWith ... let's say for a minute that he really did send these these and put a little devices and that he's a loser on the bottom in plain English why do you think he chose these targets because they are exactly the type that are making them feel smaller than it already is\nI definitely agree with you my analogy of it is that\nYou know if if you hear your mom said something about the neighbors you pretty much just take that with a grain of salt veteran moms opinion\nBut if you hear the neighbors say that they want people to go out and abuse your mom to catch your mom in a restaurant and screaming her face to catch the ball and screaming her faith you're probably much going to touch 'em in the face\nYou're saying the Maxine Waters inciting violence a Hillary Clinton uh Eric Holder saying when they go low we kick them you think that that triggered this man\nAbsolutely I mean it has that Trump had eroded do with what this guy did I think he was just fighting back\nAll right so here's a fighter any fights for us but you're saying as an independent you're still voting Republican hasn't changed your vote at All right correct correct\nAll right you're getting a copy of stop mass hysteria because I could see you're not hysterical eight five five four to seven to eight to\n... ... e mail packages no no the stamps were not stamped a post Marc number one number two\nAny package like this is caught by machines in the postal service or by manually manually caught they wouldn't send these over so how did these so called devices get into the mailboxes of CNN\nOr whatever his name as a George service George Soros up there in ... toner\nAnd such how did how did they get there and why is knows I'm going to keep repeating this why is there no surveillance footage of any of the mailboxes when devices were put there they have around the clock\nSecurity Hillary Clinton has a bill I don't know who was in the house at the time they have Secret Service on the premises cameras up\nThe trees cameras in the sky high in the sky\nThe NSA has cameras today with such resolution they could see the hair on your nostril than you could see a nostril hair if they want to focus on it and we still don't have one frame of any individual putting these devices and mailboxes so I remain skeptical incidentally\nThe only question is will that hurt the Republican Party in the midterms that's all and he was really going to ask themselves there's nothing else now is there any other news out there that we should be talking about is that not really this is everyone signed with relief today we got the van\nAnd again before you turn the show a friday so you heard it all take one message on please\nTake this home the guy has a van he has a classic molester van that we all know to avoid we see a band

the schools in America and the once you let's look at California which I Know a lot about I live here\nWhen I moved here in Nineteen Seventy five one of the reasons I moved here is because I was a poor student poor grad student with two young children and how to go back to school to get my higher degrees while working while writing books\nAnd I moved here because I knew the kids could get a great education at California is a public schools and high schools and colleges I knew that they could go to any level they wanted and I was right and we once had the highest scores in the nation in this state and then what happened liberalism as what happened\nAnd where the scores in California now\nWhere are the scores in other states that have been seeing in flux of a a illiterate people from the third world because you're not bringing in people from the third world who are even literate in their own language I'm Sorry to tell you that\nThere's a huge difference in bringing in a non English speaking person who is literate in his own in his or her own language but you are bringing in people who are illiterate even in their own language they can't even read or write in their own language now how does that strength of the nation\nIt doesn't which is exactly why the Democrats want them they want millions of ignoramus as that can easily be swayed manipulated in order to advance their socialist agenda and I\nAnd that categorically advance their socialist agenda I for one I'm not a socialist my grandfather fled socialist Russia\nAnd he came to America for the freedoms that I enjoy and I'm not gonna sit here and tell you I Want to see what George Soros wants for this country I Do not\nI'm not going to tell you that I don't think that Hillary Clinton is wrong and all of the other Dennis ends of the left are the right way to go I think they're all a hundred percent wrong a hundred percent wrong there's not even is until a of truth that everything they say they are cynical and they only say these things in order to amass more voters\nAnd to increase the welfare state that's so clear to anyone who's actually study world history\nAnd so it brings us back again to this and put a little guy this mad bomber here who didn't you know the manner couldn't bomb straight so to speak\nYou know what why these bombs what were they made of and how do they get them all over the country and such a short period of time you know as the Philippine doesn't matter whether his family is really from the Philippines and they are more involved in fighting the Communist Party the Philippines\nOn his linked to page ... access but his grandfather colonel balances are look sigh ac was a martial arts practitioner who developed his own style of fighting course Cy Cy a collie\nAnd their style was used to fight the Communist Party the Philippines and a hand to hand combat and there's actually a detailed the website about the fighting style so what does that have to do with anything that has a lot to do with everything if if that is true about this this guy\nSo he's in America now and he sees a communist movement growing by the day by leaps and bounds\nYou think are making this up didn't Bernie Sanders said he's a Democrat socialist that we all know what that really means do we know that those are called ... code words for outright government control of it every aspect of your life from cradle to grave\nWe're pretty far along with that already aren't way\nHow different way than most socialist nations Raleigh have breath away from losing it all what really differentiates this nation from socialist nations\nAre when you actually analyze it only a very few things want our Second Amendment right to bear arms none of the socialist nations permit the people

remember that one I don't know that was the lead and\nWasn't that led and who said the object of socialism communism of course it was\nSo you know those are do not know the history are condemned to repeat it I Know my history luckily I'm well educated and I know the history of the left wing in the world and in America so now let's just boil it down here is a a guy uneducated guy on the bottom weightlifter steroid user\nTypical uh insecure male usually insecure males are weightlifters the steroid users I've known that since I'm Fifteen Years old I remember when I was a young weightlifter\nIn Queens New York I went to what was then a new a new group called a new a gym I used to go to the gym phonetically after high school it was called American help studios there were new in those days I mean before that you had barbells in your basement\nFor like Joel leader that you use the cold I had them too I've worked out since I'm a little kid I was always like small and why are in very strong so I started to go to the gym the American studios and I saw a lot of guys they're not a norm is arms and legs and and they're like weird looking but they were all on drugs or some kind\nAnd I remember trying to build myself up to look like one of these guys and a girl said to me it was in high school I Swear to God somebody's girls were so smart she said something along launches don't you know the old weightlifters are insecure like cut through me like a knife\nSo wow man she's really onto something all weightlifters are insecure as true to this day as well by the way I'm not knocking it keep lifting weights all weightlifters they're insecure as what she said\nOkay so let's let's put that on the side for a minute so now you've got this guy who was an avid weightlifter muscle bound steroids a muscle shirt and he has nothing else to hang is masculinity on other than\nNationalism so now enter now entered the madness how's the madness entered the man's brain\nWhile the man that says that he's called every name under the sunny feel humiliated he feels small or he knows that the people that he hates are the ones that look down upon him the elite so to speak\nHe fears that the last shred of dignity that he has will be taken away from him by those people so something in his brain changes brain changes\nYou don't have to be a psychiatrist do agree with every word I just said and what am I leading to\nWhat our leading to is the left is triggering a lot of people now into these kind of acts and it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better if they don't stop and when you see these mobs incited by Maxine Waters\nNancy Pelosi and they are exciting them where all deplorable says that she the pillow see\nWhen you see these mobs these mobs threatened men like this uh this America bomber if you want to call him that he feels more and more threatened by the mobs so he gets increasingly mad in his brain and that's the cycle that you have to break\nAnd so you could blame anybody you want the left us already blaming Trump\nWhich is ludicrous because it's just as easy to lay blame at the foot of CNN which is around the clock hatred not only of Trump I got to repeat this Jeff Zucker whatever his name was run CNN you could just as soon say he triggered this man\nAs you could say Donald Trump that if you have an around the clock array of puppets on your network like CNN or MSNBC do who are constantly mocking ridiculing putting down Trump and his supporters\nNever forget that when you put down Trump to these guys like this guy\nYou're attacking him and when you continue to demonize Trump like you do what you're doing is you're triggering men like this on the bottom\nDo you think that this is going to make ... for one
