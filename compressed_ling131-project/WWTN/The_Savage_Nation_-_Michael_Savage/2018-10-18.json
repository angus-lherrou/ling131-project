think about the killing them like a show in the Saudi embassy I said I have no opinion whatsoever I wasn't there\nAnd I caught 'em off guard he said well that's what makes you so popular because you don't claim to know everything about everything like everyone else in the media has an opinion on everything I so it's easy to have an opinion on it\nYou know you might might have a computer uh let's

Obama flooded America with Honduran refugees remember he was bringing them by the train load through Mexico train loads of young women and babies and infants who will never work in this country never permanent or to the state\nNow before that there had been those IQ in America member that little disease called ... but you see it was endemic in Honduras\nZika was endemic in Honduras\nAnd Obama by flooding America with millions and millions I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of immigrants he brought in the ... virus and nothing ever was said about it by the government in the media well now we have a FM a polio like illness\nWho are destroying children are twenty two states and again the dummies in the media or it's science illiterates gee I don't know that the city she tells us there's no known cause wash your hands with soap and water you hear so let's look into this by the way welcome free thinkers wherever you are\nWe are a dying breed in an age of thought control that's right free thinkers\nAre are a dying breed and thought to Charles so the headline is Trump threatened to cut us aid to Honduras over immigrants right\n\nThreatened to cut us aid to Honduras over immigrants now I was asked this morning what would you do to stop the flood of Hondurans that are missing\nUh to cross from Mexico into America and again sucked the nation dry\nWell here's an answer to that question didn't we just cut a deal with Mexico called NAFTA wasn't a highly touted by the Trump Administration is a great cure all for all of our problems with Mexico yeah we'll tell others can be great to be wonderful for America well since Mexico's now a partner in everything\nAnd everyone's happy we ... we we have to say to Mexico okay you've got to stop them in Mexico is that the transit through your nation\nAnd we will provide the funding to build housing and detention facilities for all the Hondurans in Mexico but they're not coming into America they are not crossing our border and you're going to stop them with the Mexican military and you're going to give them\nThe attention that they need the care that they need but we're not taking them not tell me what's wrong with that idea\nAnd nothing's wrong with the idea but I'm not in power I'm only a talk show host I should say what do I know I Know everything I Know everything about a lot of things that are nothing about some things let me tell you that right now and so the fact of the matter is that is a logical conclusion is it\nActually is a logical way to stop the flood of Honduras or coming in who is amassing to cross the border and suck out welfare system dry and destroy your hospitals again again take everything from the American people ... to take everything\nWe may as well being invaded by a foreign army so you look at the Hondurans is an awful lot of young men and military age ... mile of the of the caravan terribly when they come into my camel although they're calling it a caravan\nNo you're stopping in Mexico the Mexican stopping in Mexico we provide Mexico with the money to build sane logical you main housing for them a very primitive order we're not giving them a a three level a three bedroom two bath\nColor television house basic barracks like his soldiers live in\nAnd they'll get much Medicaid and they do in Honduras and then when they're better send them home that simple

I don't know how many hundreds of thousands\nOf immigrants he brought in Zeke a virus and nothing ever was said about it by the government in the media well now we have a FM a polio like illness\nGo at destroying shoulder twenty two states and again the dummies in the media or as science illiterates gee I don't know that the CDC tells us there's no known cause wash your hands with soap and water you hear so let's look into this by the way welcome free thinkers wherever you are\nWe are a dying breed in an age of thought control that's right free thinkers\nAre are a dying breed and thought control so the headline is Trump threatened to cut us aid to Honduras over immigrants right\n\nTrump threatened to cut us aid to Honduras over immigrants now I was asked this morning what would you do to stop the flood of Hondurans that are missing or to cross from her Mexico into America and again suck the nation dry\nWell here's an answer to that question didn't we just cut a deal with Mexico called NAFTA wasn't a highly touted by the Trump Administration is a great cure all for all of our problems with Mexico yeah we'll tell others can be great to be wonderful for America\nWell since Mexico's now a partner in everything and everyone's happy we ... we we have to say to Mexico okay you've got to stop them in Mexico just after transit through your nation\nAnd we will provide the funding to build housing and detention facilities for all the Hondurans in Mexico but they're not coming into America they are not crossing our border and you're going to stop them with the Mexican military\nAnd you're going to give them the tension that they need and the care that they need but we're not taking them\nNow tell me what's wrong with that idea and there's nothing is wrong with the idea but I'm not in power I'm only a talk show host\nI should say what do I know I Know everything I Know everything about a lot of things that are nothing about some things let me tell you that right now after the fact of the matter is that is a logical conclusion as\nI say it's a logical way to stop the flood of Hondurans are coming in horse amassing to cross the border and suck out welfare system dry and destroy our hospitals again again take everything from the American people the ... take everything\nWe may as well being invaded by a foreign army so you look at the Hondurans is an awful lot of young men and military age ... mile of the of the caravan terribly or where they're coming in by Campbell although they're calling it a caravan\nNo you stop him in Mexico the Mexican stopping in Mexico we provide Mexico with the money to build\nSame logical you main housing for them a very primitive order we're not giving them a a three level a three bedroom two bath color

to paralysis in deaths in children\nOn October fourth health officials in Minnesota now says six children contracted a FM acute flashing ... which is ... polio like\nNow the CDC has been investigating this increase in a FM which begins twenty fourteen but they don't know why it's happening therefore I fired the head of the CDC\nI'd fire him yesterday when he doesn't know what kind of scientists doesn't know what do you mean paid for if you don't get out of there what you like to go to ... vacations in Thailand and study the sexual habits of horses\nSo every every article says the causes of FM are still unclear\nIt's unclear we don't know anything\nAbout its thought today if I may be a communicable disease really while they as one link oh it may be a communicable disease\nAnd certain viruses including polio enter a virus as a dental viruses West Nile virus may even cause FM we're the west Nile virus come from ... west ... doesn't say New York virus doesn't\nMean the west Nile virus when it come from or where you can pretty much the where I'm going with this right\nWell you understand what I what I like to see which is close the borders do health screening like was done when your grandfather a grandmother came your great grandfather when anyone with an illness was quarantine to prevent them from spreading and into the healthy population out those are antiquated ideas\nYou can quarantine anyone no matter what disease they have that would go against the uh the sensibilities of the American left\nAnd so the healthy population\nIs an increased risk of diseases like this from these third world countries in plain English common sense would dictate you know let a disease person then your country and common sense if you have a house or apartment would you let some of the a communicable disease in your apartment unless you're a moron and San Francisco\nAnd San Francisco probably sleep with a person with a communicable disease to show the good left us they were they to price them in a kiss them on the lips the show with good good people they are that's how they are\nBut if you have a say nation you say no I don't want to get sick\nSo what I'm saying to

or less the outbreak of polio like\nA a a polio like illness that are really recognize children trying to suggest as a relationship to immigrants and I will tell you right now you say will come out what's the relationship between this polio like illness called a FM\nThat's hitting the children in America and immigrants or you're just doing this for hysteria because you want to sell stop mass hysteria I'll let you decide okay if you go back in the literature you'll find that epidemiologic data\nSuggest that this a FM cluster was likely associated with a large outbreak of e v the sixty eight ... sixty eight\nYou know where a B.D sixty eight had been endemic and still is endemic what you'll not finding the media anymore Honduras and Central America I'll say it again this virus even the even the sixty eight which\nWe read about for a while has been wiped out of the main wiped out of the literature you can find it anywhere and you can not find any science that shows any relationship between eighty the sixty eight\nAnd the outbreak of FM because they will not fund that kind of research because as I said I've tried to tell you over and over again how corrupt our science has become in the west particularly in the United states of America in\nOther words you will not get if you're a PHD student or young scientist and you said look I'm thinking about this this outbreak of polio like illness and the older relationship between the sixty eight which was endemic in Honduras you wouldn't get ten cents a study that\nThe CDC wouldn't fund at the end I H wouldn't funded you'd probably lose your your post occupy thrown out of school this is what happened in the Soviet Union under Stalin was just trying to tell you the way it is I'm just trying to tell you
