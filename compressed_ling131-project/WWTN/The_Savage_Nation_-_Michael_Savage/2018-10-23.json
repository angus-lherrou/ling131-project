nature liberal who was never found any way to disagree with anything that I say\nAnd so can you tell me all your liberals are so concerned with health care\nAnd your healthcare benefits that's all you're worried about where's the money would come from you have all these illegals come across the border where where's the healthcare going to come from for you you know that they're going to get better health care then you you know that don't you do you know that right now the illegals can go to any emergency room in America and qualify for the best healthcare and the entire world without showing any ideas you know that\nYou know hospitals are not allowed to ask for any idea because of you and yet you're complaining that your health care isn't good enough\nWell I'm going to ask you again you are now an advisor to the president of the United states of America\nThe caravans of now combine and grown to at least fourteen thousand illegal aliens or invading the nation and it could become Trump's Waterloo while right now it's only Trump's Alamo it as an existential threat to the nation and to the presidency of Donald Trump\nNow you've seen the footage strapping young men and good new clothing\nOr in front of them women pushing strollers with five children in the stroller are we supposed to take care of all of these people every third world impoverished person in the world is coming here and the truth is we can't take care of them all moral but there's another question that is begging to be answered\nAccording to the Democrats we are a racist nation\nAccording to the Democrats were very very bad to illegal immigrants and were racist to Hispanics and what are they coming for if this is such a horrible nation and so racist why they all breaking down our door to get in here\nAnd I guess another horrible truth for all of you there's not a liberal listening to this program who wants to them here can you name anyone in the Upper East side of the Upper West side of Manhattan who really wants hordes of illegal aliens in the neighborhood do you actually think they're going to rush out an invite these people to dinner now they don't want their quiet little lives ruined\nLet's be clear this was an attempt by the Democrats to create mass hysteria\nAgainst President Trump against Republicans and against the Americans who support them that means you and I this is how evil the Democratic party has become because if we were a sovereign saying nation there would be no division on this issue\nBut they would like to see Trump send the military to the border and they would like to see immigrants brutally mistreated or shot and killed at the border they'd like to see a killing at Kent State so they could hold up the pictures but make no mistake about it this is an invasion and invasion army it's an army without guns\nYou might say that no other nation on earth would allow something like this to happen but you would be wrong\nGermany's communist president Angela Merkel did this to Germany and look what happened to them leaders in Germany are now getting up in gloating and saying there are no Germans any more\nThere are French communists was saying that no French anymore they're English communist saying there is no England anymore and now in America that you want someone to stand up and chances are no Americans anymore\n[noise] well this big caravan and the others that will come after it\nOr an existential threat to the survival of the nation of it has not stopped and the question goes back to the first one I asked him the Savage Nation how does Donald Trump stop it he is the commander in chief he does not need Congress to approve his actions when it comes to the military so what should the military do\nWhen their sense of the border\nTell me what they should do what you their rules of engagement be are they going to be water cannons rubber bullets\nHow far should they go Trump is the man in the driver's seat we put him there just for this alone did you and I just said\nNever forget what Trump was elected on he was elected on stopping the flood of immigrants coming into America I don't care what else you may have voted for that's the number one issue that he took in Rand what right well this is now his moment so how does he stop the human wave\nWell here's a ... a thought this a little troubling it doesn't really matter what Trump does\nIf he sends the military to the border the vermin and the media will follow and they'll make their pictures and videos and frame interviews with women and children to fit their sick narrative and will make it look like Trump the military the border patrol the Republicans are all evil white men\nResorting to drastic measures to keep brown mothers and children from a better life in America you can you can bet your Social Security on that\nThey did the same thing with the separation policy at the border [noise]\nDid you notice that every media member every Democrat in Congress every democratic spoke every Democrat spokesperson all of them said Trump was ripping children from their parents remember the narrative\nRipping children from their parents ripping families apart you think that's a coincidence the word was chosen on purpose and they all collaborate and then using it it was to create an image in your mind and it was to induce a mass hysteria\nAgainst not only Donald Trump but against this nation itself\nNow I Will invite you to call on this issue but I don't want to flood myself only with this because there were other issues that are plaguing may I almost did they periscope performance over the weekend on Trump ripping up the nuclear control agreement with Russia\nIt scared me to my core because this was one of Reagan's signature achievements was working out a nuclear control agreement with Russia and then I wake up and I see oh Trump's going to wrap it up and throw it out why now I'm going to make is very clear\nDonald Trump is surrounded by nationalists and global lists over the last several months the global is have taken control of this administration\nMost notably the walrus once I saw that little bellicose walrus enter the inner circle I knew things were going to go really bad in this country and in the world\nThat bellicose not the wall rushed the national security advisor is struggling around the world stage throwing his weight around threatening Russia as we speak\nIt's not going to end very well for the world because I Will tell you this I hear all Russia violated the agreement first of all how do you know that's true\nWhat because you read that in the newspapers do we really know Russia actually violated that agreement number one and number two if you have an agreement with someone and you think they're violating it if you call them and say I'm ripping up the agreement they no longer have any reason whatsoever to talk with you about abiding by any part of that agreement\nThat is the stupidest thing I've ever seen the dumbest thing I've ever seen and it's a turn from what Trump was elected to do never forget why I backed him I didn't know Donald Trump before he ran I met him once or twice I didn't know him but I made it a rational decision\nOn this show and I bet you if you hadn't voted in the years to come out and vote that you remember when I said to you I\nSaid this may be our last chance he's not a politician but most importantly I did this because I knew he could be the others and I knew that he alone could beat Hillary Clinton and I was right but there was another thing about it that you may not remember I kept saying to you Donald Trump is a man of peace\n... at Donald Trump is not an interventionist Donald Trump wants our troops out of Afghanistan he wants to our troops back home Donald Trump even set on the show in November of twenty sixteen that if I win Michael he said I Will meet with President put and he said that right on the show long forgotten but I haven't forgotten that\nDonald Trump ran as a man of peace and as a non interventionist that such a big issue that I also want to get to but primarily today we're going to talk about the confrontation at the border the Alamo as I call it and I'm going to ask you\nWhat would you advise the president to do can you come up with a solution that hasn't been thought of yet\nNow over the weekend I came up with

I'm here was to help elect Donald Trump I played a big role in this election\nWell I'd like to suggest\nThat you the audience that voted for Donald Trump helped Donald Trump stop this invasion\nBut I don't see any creative ideas coming out right now and I will tell you that there was a strategic era in the Trump Administration you probably haven't heard this yet\nBecause either the media is against Trump will lick his boots either America's anchor ham who attack you and ... America's Ike a ham ridiculed Trump for your strike it's OK I'm Glad he joined the team because it's good for ratings\nUh but citing NAFTA before the midterms was one of the greatest mistakes strategically ever made why do I say that\nBecause Trump should have waited until after the elections to negotiate with the Mexican government because if he had waited until after the midterms to have a negotiated NAFTA completely\nHe could have had the Mexican government stop the illegal aliens from entering this nation through Mexico he would've said here are the terms okay we want to do a deal with you but this is a big deal to us\nSo will sign it after the elections but you're going to stop them before they even get near the border now what would you do a few of Mexico\nYou would've said okay luckily we got to do it\nBut what would you do if you're in Mexico now when you've got everything you wanted a NAFTA and then some and now it's not their problem it's our problem and tell me what you'll do now if you're Mexico nothing tell me what what what ... what leverage that we have over Mexico now that they signed the way all of our negotiating power so you say the ... of the deal I'm Sorry that was a disaster missed like\nMany of you are under the mistake of the notion that Donald Trump is not a man you think he's a God this is the worst thing you could possibly think he's a man he's only a man he's a smart man\nBut it's only a man why you're turning a man into something that he's not why or why do you people think that a leader should be a God or a demagogue you did it with a bomb on the left thought he was a God look at that that to this country\nThe damage is done to this nation internationally\nHas not yet been told just look at Iran and what he's done ... to that nation's ability to destroy so many people on this planet but let's put Obama aside right now Donald Trump is president\nAnd as a man I'm sure he's up at night wondering what can I actually do every scenario imaginable runs through a person's mind doesn't run through your mind when you're facing a problem\nWhether it's a child who is in trouble or a bad marriage you probably neutralizes everything you think that you're going to do you think I'll do this than something then your mind says no you can't because of that so if you weigh him you'd be saying okay well put troops on the board and they can't do that because I\nWas a hundred of reasons why he should but he can't so what county do tell me what he actually can do\nBuild a wall well that should've been done a long time ago that's what he was elected for that was his signature campaign issue I Can't blame them entirely Congress has stood in a way every step of the way the obstructionist Charles Schumer has held up the money\nA pillow she washed the feats of the illegals et cetera so they never wanted a wall they live off illegal aliens\nThe governor of the state of California the governor of the state of New York I Will put my career on the line and say if there had been voter id in the state's going back Fifteen Years they would not be politicians in power right now they'd be the obscure people on the ice sheets of history that they should have been\nBut because of the millions of illegal aliens who've been flooded over the borders into California Texas border states\nYou have a democratic socialist machine that is almost unstoppable and you may say oh good great well if you like Venezuela and eating giraffes for dinner\nPlease show your support and text V.

the New York home of billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros after they'd been for police department received the call about a suspicious package Monday afternoon shrunk protests were poorly\nThey're telling democratic candidates to ignore public worries about the hordes\nOkay\nWell I Know how to fix that Donald Trump\nIf you're still talk to me instead of to the world bank or have an answer for you Mr Trump you know you ought to broaden the euro kitchen cabinet\nYou talk to that stewards twice a day I understand it's not he's not doing too good right now you don't have people who watch Fox News it told me that can't watch it because all day long as the same stories on average shorter matter what show they turn off the same five stories with the same gash\nTwenty times can you watch Newt Gingrich or any of the other hacks that they have on over and over and over again and yet it seems that Fox News is not running the presidency will go to the geniuses now and ask them what they think should be done\nBecause they won't have the answer I'm going to give you Mr President because here it comes for free for the world to hear what's the problem\nThe problem is the Seventeen to twenty thousand illegal aliens who are going to hit the border and try to come over the border and then you're going to be stuck with them what are you going to do about it [noise]\nWell if you hear that most Americans don't care about immigration they care only about their own self meaning health care what you have to do miss the Trump is cleverly explained to the American people how much health care is sucked out of this system by non citizens\nYou don't have to go any further than your local hospital\nI've been there several times over the last several years\nAnd I've been given worse care than illegal immigrants who don't speak a word of English I see them come in with a runny nose with five members of their family with some ... votes on with much though on their feet from the from Mexico you want me to be graphic I'll be graphic I'd had a paint the picture with words maybe it's offensive to you maybe it's not polite NYU talk\nBut they're not so polite either and the invaders and not so polite either by the way\nMaybe if more Americans were less polite than they are we wouldn't be overwhelmed as we are right now\nExplain to the American people how much each illegal alien costs us in terms of welfare and health benefits and then explain to them that if these illegal aliens were allowed into the country there won't be health care for all their lives will be healthcare for non\nThat's what's gonna happen the hospitals will be turned into third world hospitals the hospitals will be overwhelmed who's going to pay for the doctors and nurses and the equipment and all of the things that are required for the care of these people I Know that human beings\nI understand that you'd like to give everybody everything but the world doesn't work that way cannot work that way\nAnd the reason this nation is so great\nIs because of the hard working American people but there's a limit to how much we're willing to pay in taxes that's a separate question are you know I don't want to go into taxes right now explain to the people that want free had a health care for all how much each illegal alien cost us and what it will do to our health system and how it will\nDestroy Medicare for all destroy it completely destroy it they will you won't have anything left\nSeventy percent of Americans support Medicare for all so explain to the average American that if we let in all the immigrants that are trying to break through our borders the illegals\nWill have Medicare for non biggest the system will be completely destroyed okay so that's a simple message the president needs to get out in front of this and explain the connection between the desires of the American people that wants to the American people and the lack of\nResources that already are as in place and what it will do to the system if ah they're allowed to over on the border I mean it's pretty straightforward you know keep it simple stupid but it's all true\nI've talked about it for many years because I've been in hospitals and emergency rooms things have happened to me I\nDon't have a doctor even at my age I take the medication I Know it's a crazy I don't I have no medication so far so good and I don't go to doctors once in awhile something goes wrong I go to a doctor they're great we have the best doctors in the world\nAnd I liked that go a substance they put on my body and and run the the the thing whatever the thing is okay so far I've been lucky and uncovered by you know medical care and all of that because I paid for it my whole life\nBut I'm Talking about the masses of Americans who don't understand that everything cost something every brick on every side walk every every sector meat or every excuse me every every piece of pavement in your city cost something every fire hydrant cost something\nNow what about the one trillion dollars in unfunded pensions and the state of California one trillion dollars an unfunded pensions in California\nBecause of the unions what's the number of unfunded pensions in your state and who's going to pay that so you're telling me that there's no way to explain the American people that if we let more people into the lifeboat the light but will sink\nThat's an analogy I've used for years and all of my books I look at all my books sitting up here on my showcase\nEvery one of them has something to do with illegal immigration borders language culture has been the watch word of this program for twenty five years borders language culture borders language culture hasn't been lifted yet by or any of them I'm sure the next cartoon book will be called borders language and culture by my student\nBut this is not about me this is about this nation and what we're going to leave behind when we leave it behind what are we gonna leave behind when we leave it behind a third world cesspool again does that offend you or I Hope it does\nBiggest in San Francisco we already have a third world cesspool in the streets and it's not being caused by immigrants has been caused by liberalism mental disorder\nYou let a person dropped their pants and you're you're in a or a decade in the street you know long I have a society you have something lower than an animal or dog hides when he goes to the relief himself a dog hides\nA dog ... when a human being doesn't that's no longer a human being the person has dropped out of humanity\nAnd they're begging for society to take them and put them into a care facility begging they're begging for us to pick them up and put them in a priest facility because they have no ability to take care of themselves so we have these these these numbers of\nBums all over our streets we have armies of heroin addicts army's offensive they'll addicts armies of cocaine addicts armies of valley um addicts\nAnd who's going to pay for the care of all of these people I Love all the shows they go to intervention intervention they meet in the hotel and nothing to do they sit around in a Holiday Inn and have some ... for a drug addict I Love all of the care people it's all a racket\nThey get it both ways it's like a the trends meat company we sell everything but the squeal first you're selling the drugs then you're selling the treatment calls the treatment facilities I don't know who ...\nWho is an expert on treatment what's the recidivism rate do you have any idea I Love it Gloria went into rehab for sixteen days and then she ran away we never saw her again I Love I Love you watch these\nShows there's the family crying as the grandmother there's the grandfather weeping love you you said you know\nI don't know I so far thank God I'm and cursed with that problem I don't\nI don't know what to say about it if you have the problem find who's going to pay for it\nOh covered by Medicaid for a Medicare for all treatments in their tell me what's not covered in Medicare for all for it are just covered bald discovered\nYou know test anxiety covered alcoholism treatment covered drug addiction treatment covered how much does this cost\nHow can we afford this\nThe answer is we can't the answer is went bankrupt the answer is the government's printing money faster then why mar Germany was printing money\nThe answer is your act the actual value of your dollar is not what you think it is it's all a hoax the whole thing is a hoax built upon a house of cards and the house of cards is libel come tumbling down any day and if I were the president I Would immediately call a national emergency and I wouldn't give a\nDamn tweet about it\nI Would hold a press conference in the oval office with the seal of the United states of America and the presidency like all presidents have done in the past and stop the damn tweeting already it's not a joke\nNot the cans of speech and the oval office and said this is a national emergency and here's what I'm going to do and why\nBecause I Know healthcare is important to all of you and I want to help you get the health care unique but if we let these illegal aliens into this country they will show destroy their health care system there's a lot but let me know health care for any and so for this reason I'm

young men in great health or military age using women\nAnd babies and baby carriages as a front for the magazine publishers on the left are marching toward the U.S border aided by Mexico I've tried to warn you about what mass hysteria is all about\nI Try to warn you that this was a movement to stir up mass hysteria on both sides by the way\nThat I've also so far in this program been as constructive as anyone in the media could ever be because I told you what I think the president must do and that is hold a national news conference at the right in the in the oval office not excuse me not by choice eating\nNot through a bellicose speech in front of a crowd which changes his demeanor but in a very somber setting up the oval office\nDesk residential seal unannounced conference the president speak tonight at eight o'clock to the nation and the world and he announces we have an international crisis on our borders it's a national emergency no nation can survive an influx of this nature\nI Know that most Americans want health care for all while that is not possible and while we do have the best healthcare system in the world\nI'm here to tell you that each illegal alien cost this country approximately eighty five thousand dollars over a lifetime is probably much higher than that in medical care and medical costs alone and if you do the numbers\nThis medical system will be broken if we let these poor people in and while I have compassion for them wanting to improve their lives by coming here\nWe cannot permitted because we'll lose the greatest medical system in the world for everyone and for that reason I Am here by authorizing the military\nTo a approach the border another problem is is that they have to be stopped before they get to the border biggest by international law I think once they cross the border we have to process them for an asylum claim that's our twisted the laws are thanks to the show my pillow sheet of complex\nIt's going to have to be a little different than that and I haven't worked out the details I think that since we signed NAFTA unfortunately an foolishly NAFTA was signed a few weeks ago it destroyed any go shooting power we may have over the Mexican government\nUh but I assume there are still some elements of that that I haven't been ... that we have some control is whatever the Mexican military must be stationed way before the border\nLike a hundred miles before the border in Mexico\nBelieve me they know how to take care of their ... their immigrant problem trust me on that they don't have the human rights problems that we do\nJust speak to any Guatemalan who came here you'll hear about the Mexican military and how nicely they and how you mainly they treat other Hispanics just in case you ... you might as so choice did you think that it's all one brother you know\nSo they they know how to deal with the problem you have the detention centers you give them the humanitarian care that they need in Mexico and maybe we pay for it there but they can't come here it's that simple\nAnd that's the end of her I'd actually harder to well what's so complicated\nWhy is it so hard to think about doing that why is it so hard I Want to take some calls have been on the air for an hour and a half I haven't taken one call\nWe had a a former da and call and tell me that he knows for a fact that many of these people are smuggling drugs ... was a logical to assume that have Seventeen to twenty thousand people at least a few of them will be carrying a drugs in a in a baby carriage\nHow many movies do you have to watch the figure it out you haven't seen enough of them\nOkay so what do you think should be done ... on there are other answers\nWhat if a million Americans went to the Mexican border what if there was a million American marched to the border\nAnd we the people went to the border and said enough is enough what would happen then\nWell next tower terrible thought isn't it but what if a million American people went to the border I don't know the logistics of that may be Al Sharpton could help organize and he's real good at bringing people Bernie Sanders probably knows how to do that they would note in winter rent the buses probably owned by Republicans\nYou know probably on the buses and the Koch brothers probably on the ... the water supplies on the border for all I Know I Know they should they on them a lot of the detention centers the so called the conservative so what's your answer down there\nHuh All right we can get your calls if you want or would you rather hear me talk about it well let's begin in this segment by playing some rational sound here is representative Louie Gohmert\nThe migrant invasion in clip number one on the Savage Nation\nThe president made no

across\nThe border and New Mexico and deal with a bunch of people are not only did he put Seventy five thousand or so of a new thing called National Guard troops on the border\nBut ... in Mexico how President Trump's aren't going to send people into Mexico but he's made clear that this basically is an invasion and it needs to be stopped\nNow we hear the president himself talking about who's
