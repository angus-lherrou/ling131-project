most seriousness\nAll of the packages are being examined closely at the FBI lab in Quantico according to assistant director in charge built Sweeney\nWe're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from the suspicious packages recovered over the last few days\nRegardless of whether the pipe bombs were meant to explode Mayor Bill de Blasio said this is terrorism\nNow I find that bubbly offensive for three different reasons even though I say W offensive it's actually Tripoli offensive they say that anyone who attacks George Soros is doing it because they're anti Semite let me deal with that for a minute I'm probably more Jewish than George Soros that's number one\nAnd if you're going to tell me as a person of the Jewish faith\nIs not allowed to criticize another person in the Jewish faith without being called an anti Semite I Will say to you go to hell how's that George Soros is the most disruptive individual in the history of the American political system nobody has ever spent more money to disrupt more ...\nThen this man he has funded on the far\nYou know the good folks have been beating people up at attacking police George Soros funds them black lives matter don't tell me that a lot of domestic terrorist group because I Will disagree with you that's my opinion what because as the word black and I can't say that they are violence is something I should ignore sorry I see him\nAnd I call them as I see them\nDon't hide behind the Holocaust and anti Semitism every time someone criticizes George that is a standard operating procedure on the American left I've seen it a thousand times in my life George and you know I think people are on to you\nAnd I do think that the government has an obligation to investigate any ... in there who sets out to disrupt the political system because that's what you do that is what you do for a living us funded that'd be testable group media matters ever since I've been in radio they've been smearing me\nAnd why have you done it to keep us off your back George Soros and your son your pee wee pitched squeak son there has never earned a diamond his life of his own sits there and as a unit as big a big tower they're throwing miss him down at the world you and your son and you have the nerve to publish an article today saying\nThe president and his anti Semite supporters are blamed for bombs being sent to his father's house says that the little son\nHe wrote a new op ed for the New York times called the hate that it's consuming us this is ironic since George Soros funds hate groups I mean it's unbelievable to me so Rowse funds the biggest the most powerful hate groups in the country\nAnd he says the hatred is consuming us and then he says his father has long faced anti Semitism\nOh really but something changed the twenty sixteen he called in America's a stop demonizing politicians Diddy then why does your father fun groups to demonize Donald Trump once you start your own backyard Alexander Soros\nGeorge Soros the sun and nobody called against it as a threat to the future of American democracy and he hit out as the president and the New York times op ed entitled the hate that is consuming us\nNow this kid Alexander ... in my estimation if he didn't have a father was a bit you know like his father he couldn't get a job or selling apple computers in in Zimbabwe I don't think he'd get a job selling computers anywhere\nThen he jumps you ready to white supremacist an anti Semite ... this is stupid\nOr just stupid they're all trying to hide behind the standard operating things that they use\nSo let me read you my latest headline and I'll see what you have to say but I'm sitting here waiting for them to release their Lee Harvey Oswald I Want to know who the Lee Harvey Oswald is and by the way this is all an attempt by the way if it's left or right wing who's doing this and we don't really know at this point\nBut you got to read my headline till to actually hear what I said\nI said mail bombs high probability they could be false flags to distract from hordes of illegal aliens\nThat's a logical statement high probability could be false flags high probability could be false flags to distract from hordes of illegal aliens who've been dropped off the news a screen Sanford thing no one marching army coming from under us to suddenly disappeared\nRight so you know you don't put two and two together and I don't know who planted the bombs needed to you but I'm waiting to see who the Lee Harvey Oswald is going to be who's the patch either going to dig up\nWhen will the passing be shown high probability that could be false flags to distract from hordes illegal aliens now we can talk about that if you want the phone number is eight five five four and a seven to eight too\nBut as I said yesterday and that was the first one to say this I thought it was laughable that four of those receiving these quote bombs or check their mail at the very same time\nAnd prior to the normal delivery time of mail in their areas I thought it was ironic and really suspicious to me I didn't say all of them I said three of four of them at the same time\nRight now this plot was coordinated by someone and yet it of aided all of law enforcement in DC and New York Florida\nHow could how could that be do you have a department of homeland security that looks for these lone wolves also as I said yesterday and I was the first to say a copy today by America as\nNews blowhard none of the packages were stamped none of them were post marked rather meaning they're all hand delivered\nSo they were handling it but we haven't seen one image of one surveillance camera on all of these high powered billionaires property so that was that even possible how\nHow is that possible\nWhy were they conservative give left this this kind of talking point two weeks before the most important election of our time\nAnd by the way any bomb expert\nWho intended to target a hope a high profile individual would they put a bomb in an area they know it'd be checked by an assistant of the target not to target themselves\nI mean if you were a nut and you are an evil nut and violent nut and you wanted it hurts somebody would you put your bomb in a place where you know the person you're intending to harm never even picks up the mail\nRight you know that Obama doesn't get his own man you know ... doesn't get his own male you know Hillary doesn't get our own male so do you have to have any common sense anymore is there any common sense left now\nBy the way where did they get the private addresses of these people where they get the private address of George Soros and could tone in New York I didn't know about it until yesterday with the day before\nThese addresses a non public information and ah didn't a democratic staffer recently got arrested for stealing Republican addresses from the office of Sheila Jackson\nSo who was it who stole these private addresses from the Democrat files that's where they got him from right now what about CNN the most evil network in the history and this is not a network this is out of the Soviet Union union CNN is the equivalent of his ... and probably the wrapped in together\nSo they open their package they took a picture of it before calling the police of the bomb squad\nRight they open it took a picture of it before calling the police of the bomb squad I knew people that gullible to believe that a company like CNN would open a suspicious package without calling the bomb squad first or they're in on the scam\nRemember what I'm saying to you I'm human or using common sense and then the mainstream media outlets all had the same talking points are at the same time\nSo I think that this is either a classic sigh op\nOperation in order to distract us from the actual mob violence against conservatives\nAnd also to distract us from the army that us marching towards our southern border from a Honduras\nThe Democrats had a disaster with the Kavanaugh hearings Dianne Feinstein little trick blew up in her face\nShe tried to crucify cabinet what the false set of claims and the whole country turned against or accept Democrat operatives so that blew up in their face\nThen they figured let's get a couple of hundred marching in from Honduras women and children with carriages will do this again to Trump all of a sudden thousands joined\nThen more thousands joined then more thousands joined and now it's an army mainly of strapping young men of military age marching towards our border with new sneakers and new clothing\nWhere are they getting their food from Diane\nHow can they all have clean clothing on where the washing machines along the way this washing machines in the desert\nWhere how would they keeping themselves clean where are they going to the bathroom George\nOr even the most knuckle dragging conservative can ask these questions we don't need the blank stare at anti coup what the answer for us we don't need those stooges on MSNBC to answer it for us you know most of us are very intelligent George you may not know that living in your little tower their

it why they withholding this perhaps there's a brilliant left us who works for media matters a can answer the questions that I'm asking today\nSince you're so smart you know everything about America's
