F. in in the oval office he used the F word\nHe called the Seventy two year old president broke the rapper had no respect for the oval office he wore no tie he wore a stupid baseball hat on throughout is this the kind of behavior you want in the oval office\nUh-huh would you ever expected me when I went to start when I went in there to start dropping F bombs with the president\nWhy is it no conservatives have said that this was unacceptable\nBy that low life rapper I Am the only voice of his had the nerve to point out the behavior like they should not be accepted in the oval office that as a sacred office even Obama didn't permit that kind of behavior to be shown publicly why are we turning this nation over to whatever pop culture\nDemands there needs to be the core and brought back to our nation's capital remember\nWhere it starts it starts there not only in the White House but in the Capitol building to there was no civility left\nIn our leadership nor the Capitol building with a gaggle of reporters on the ground with dirty clothing I'd make them wear suits and ties and limited to a few\n... press pools and that's it a few in the excuse me in the press pool sitting there and then ... the hearings the clicking and the the lights\nIt's a disgrace the whole thing is a mess I Want to talk about nothing related to the low life rapper and the White House although it's a symbol of the decline of our civilization by the way I Want to talk about something else I'm I'm a student of history as you know\nAnd I am a student of war and warfare revolution\nI Want to tell you something I saw last week or two weeks ago that one third of American youth would be unqualified to serve in the military because their fat slobs one\nThird of American youth are fat blobs of garbage sugar or salt dairy just useless piles of DNA useful only for a social media\nSo one third of the youth couldn't serve in the military so I look back on how many died in the last weeks of World War two and I look at how the people lived through it I don't understand how this country could live through anything like this\nAnd are focusing instead on one part of World War two when tens of thousands died in flames when the allies bomb Dresden, Germany\nIt burned for seven days in seven nights Fifteen square kilometers of the city was reduced to rubble bodies or carried away from the center of Dresden, Germany days after the bombing how many died twenty five thousand to forty thousand civilians now why my telling you this you'll figure it out so\nOkay how many died in the fire bombing of Germany the you know the answer how many died amongst the Russians to take Berlin in the last weeks of the war you know how many I'll tell you how\nMany of the show goes on Hamburg forty thousand died in one month to Nineteen forty three and a number forty thousand here if you break it hanging they'll call like shy still lawyer and he says the company they slipped on the floor do break a hanging out on a department store and they get a shy ... lawyers so forty thousand burned to death in Hamburg\nTwenty five thousand forty thousand killed in Dresden Berlin twenty two thousand one month\nForce I'm Seventeen thousand killed in Nineteen forty five one month dumps that Germany eleven thousand killed in one month uh Nineteen forty four cities reduce the ashes but how many uh Russians died in the last weeks of the war to take Berlin when they bury the third wife\nYou know how many died you have any idea how many Russians was shot in the back by their own officers if they didn't go did you know that here in the military if you have let's say depression or bipolar and we don't feel good that day you wake up at the wrong side of the bed you got to pass a day you get shot in the back at that time by the by the Soviet military\nYour nominees Soviet tanks were lost to the streets of Berlin eight hundred tanks were blown up just taking Berlin and the last weeks of the war because the idiot maniac craze drug addict Adolf Hitler refused to let us troops even though the war was lost he refused to let his troops give up\nAnd save themselves and of course save a Berlin from total destruction this is what happens when you have fanaticism the battle for ... took twenty two thousand civilian lives in the street\nBattles twenty two thousand [noise] but how many died amongst the Russians oh I'm telling you this well I'm telling you this to show you the scope of human tragedy and how we in this country are so diluted into thinking that every one of our complaints and cranks and this and that is something important it's stupid\nIt's stupid it's an embarrassment to the human condition\nAnd we're so soft I don't know how this country can survive much longer\nWe become so soft\nI don't know how the nation can go on\nBut I'm I I'm not I'm increasingly pessimistic about the survival of America incidentally that's really what I'm getting it\nYou may think I'm supposed to sit here and give me give you a ... job it's a wonderful world everything's gray everything's coming up roses you take away welfare for the fifty five percent of the American people don't work\nYou take away the food stamps or lazy bums who don't work\nYou cut off the s as the guy from the fake crazy people you'll take back all of you know how many people are on disability federal disability payments due to how many people on federal disability payments it went up on the Trump not down\nBecause they're not cracking down on the fake disability I think it was twelve or fourteen million people are faking it twelve to fourteen million people declare their to their unable to work you hit us and you're paying hundreds of billions of dollars for all of this the country is so soft that all they want is more free things you understand that\nSo then you've got demagogues on the left say we'll give you anything free that you want\nAnd all of the losers of the world so yeah yeah yeah we want the free stuff will vote for them but where's the money she goes to come from where for me\nFrom the people who work that's where it comes from so what happens is when when they taxes to death and becomes too high what do you think happens do you think that there's a limited money\nWe stop working we just stopped working and that's the end of it and then what's gonna happen what are you gonna do eat dirt so this is how it works unless you see the whole picture than you actually believe that Elizabeth Warren is an Indian chief this is the Savage Nation I'll be back\nDuring the

O. two levels were higher than they are today I guess Iraq Obama didn't get any of this when he was at Columbia University learning how to become a community agitator so what I'm saying to you is of course I Want to clean up your earth\nMore so than you might imagine and I've been working in ... conservation movements and somebody youngster that doesn't mean we have to have is the area in order to make our point and it's embarrassing to me that the administration refuses to permit\nMy wisdom to get anywhere near the president it really gets me angry actually because he's losing great opportunity and so when he was interviewed by sixty minutes and she said what about the scientists say global warming is this and that he could have\nDevastated our with one word Vostok ice core samples and a few more line she would have been finished and it wouldn't make it look so smart because he is so smart but you can't just wing everything that you talk about you can't just shot it on to everybody like everyone's stupid moron and no one's really listening to you and I go on to the next point\nIf you want to make points with the public and I mean the educated public tried to use them educated statements is what I'm saying in order to use educators statements you need educated people around you not people are dropped out of high school and got very rich bamboo selling the public\nBecause they once were good looking before they started to look like Lew Abbott\nSo that's all I Want to say about that subject Vostok ice core samples now over the weekend on friday night after doing a busy radio show I raced to a studio in San Francisco and was on the\nGovernor Huckabee show I Love Governor Huckabee you know why a because he has me on a show and he likes me I mean I tell you the truth the man actually respects me to death or you could see it in his presentation how much he loves me he's a true Christian as the audience is very devout he was a\nHe was on Fox News

you know I I was researching a something bizarre to a person's hair and fingernails continue to grow after death they show what the hell is he crazy no\nWell I think about a lot of things I pre birth after death and we've always seen the mythology about nails seem to be growing after death I Want to give it to science and that of the few minutes\nAnd the optical illusion that is responsible for the idea that herring fingernails grow after that is a is something that you need to know about\nIt's the same as the optical illusion about global warming being caused by mankind and unless you know the science and don't listen to the fact scientists you're not going to know the truth\nAnd as I say I probably done more for cleaning up the environment and saving the environment than most of the gangsters in the global warming business 'cause I've never received a nickel from oil companies or from the global warming gangster business Sheldon I'm WABC go ahead please make your point\nMichael how are you this afternoon a police what's your point\nFive point of mind to make Michael's this okay you talk about on on global warming I agree with you but I think another issue that has to be a has to be addressed to the concept of global climate change and that that is a different issue\nWhether that's that's just shifting the the rhetoric about the same scam\nReally Michael let me let me try to\nDo well well my shoulders hold on shoulder and hold on oh did you hear anything I said about the Vostok ice core samples\nI did I get I get\nAll right so you're a reasonable man how can you deny what was discovered by the science\nNot I'm agreeing with you OK but let me let me let me make my point and see what you feel about off\nRight now I'm listening now you got my attention for\nOkay let's say there's five hot spots in the world and that produces a folder full ... let's see\nOh okay and those fi hotspots\nGetting rearranging on different positions around the world although he has not increased the fight hotspots and move\nAnd wonder since it's the end of the movement of heat from hot to cool\nOkay if those fine hotspots move we will not limit global warming but we they exist at global climate change my my point is Michael but I feel on them all the nominees and the extreme hurricanes shape\nLately among it's not a political phone call by the way\nWe waited on hold and let you want to talk about hurricane strength you do know that one in Nineteen twenty six was stronger than the last one\nBut I again I make an appointment\nOr I'm making it you want to talk facts the statistics here Nineteen twenty six the hurricane winds were stronger than the one that just hit\nI don't like about you [laughter] do you feel that there are more hurricanes now I never\nKnow there are no more hurricanes now no that's another mythology but look you and I may agree on one thing show when as we all want to clean the earth that I've worked for that most of my adult life but I'm not going to base it upon fall science as my whole point\nNo I'm not I'm not clocking I'm done talking if you were\nFar I think we've exhausted this I mean we're saying two different things maybe we all want the same thing\nBut a three hundred and twenty five thousand years ago global temperatures and C. O. two levels were higher than they are today period understory Leslie stall\nAnd those are the Vostok ice core samples\nTrump could have stumped with that one line but he didn't\nBecause I'm banned from the Trump Administration by the new administration is communications director who came from Fox News he bought me a Fox News and now he's blocking me from the White House to their deficit not mind I'll go on and they'll go on and I wish him the best that I support them all meaning that this administration\nBut I'm going to tell you right now they're not doing themselves a favor by omitting the education that I have\nFrom their discussions it's that simple\nAnd now let's move on to other topics too fingernails on here really grow after death member I said that it's an optical illusion what I mean by that\nBecause as after we die\nFlesh shrinks as it becomes the hydrate lineup to discuss the topic and so the skin retraction and the nails and hair appear longer but they're not actually growing\nSo it's a it's a matter of understanding the optical illusion of death to understand why ... hair and they also looked like they are growing as the same with global warming or climate change which is a new name for the same thing or is it warmer or is it not ... well I'm Sorry to tell you it's actually not warm and does that mean I like pollution absolutely not\nI think it's great to eliminate as many pollutants as we can I'm super sensitive to any\nAirborne particles I won't be in a room with someone with cologne on you put me in a room\nWith a Middle Eastern car salesmen I have to go almost to an emergency room if they shake my hand I have to almost have my hand\nRemoved from my body I Can't get the sent off my palm for like weeks after that\nI don't like I like pollution of any kind but mostly I hate stupidity is the worst kind of pollution there is joy those Savage Nation cold feet by ... feet by ... for the summer\nBecause Nashville needs a voice we're here we're talking Ninety nine seven WPN news whether trap\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur isn't thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nSex fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.

goal of socialism is communism lead and said that not Michael Savage but its quoted in stop mass hysteria\nWhat else did lead and say that you must know a lie told often enough becomes the truth\nThat

last week or two weeks ago that one third of American youth\nWould be unqualified to serve in the military because their fat slobs one third of American youth are fat blobs of garbage sugar or salt dairy just useless piles of DNA useful only for a social media\nSo one third of the youth couldn't serve in the military so I look back on how many died in the last weeks of World War two and I look at how the people lived through it I don't understand how this country could live through anything like this\nAnd are focusing instead on one part of World War two when tens of thousands died in flames when the allies bomb Dresden, Germany it burned for seven days in seven nights\nFifteen square kilometers of the city was reduced to rubble bodies or carried away from the center of Dresden, Germany days after the bombing how many died twenty five thousand to forty thousand civilians now why my telling you this you'll figure it out soon\nOkay how many died in the fire bombing of Germany the you know the answer how many died amongst the Russians to take Berlin in the last weeks of the war you know how many\nI'll tell you how many of the show goes on to Hamburg forty thousand died in one month to Ninety forty three year the number forty thousand here if you break it hanging they'll call like shy still lawyer and he does the company they slipped on the floor do break a hanging they'll at a department store and they get a ... lawyers so forty thousand burned to death in Hamburg\nTwenty five thousand the forty thousand killed and dressed in Berlin twenty two thousand one month\nForce I'm Seventeen thousand killed in Nineteen forty five one month dumps that Germany eleven thousand killed in one month to Ninety forty four cities reduced the ashes but how many uh Russians died in the last weeks of the war to take Berlin when they bury the third wife\nYou know how many died you have any idea how many Russians was shot in the back by their own officers if they didn't go did you know that here in the military ... let's say depression or bipolar you don't feel good that day you wake up at the wrong side of the bed you got to pass a day you got shot in the back at that time by the by the Soviet military\nDo you how many Soviet tanks lost the streets of Berlin eight hundred tanks were blown up just taking Berlin and the last weeks of the war\nBecause the idiot maniac crazed drug addict Adolf Hitler refused to let us troops even though the war was lost he refused to let his troops give up and save themselves and of course save a Berlin from total destruction this is what happens when you have to ...\nThe battle for ... took twenty two thousand civilian lives in the street battles twenty two thousand what how many died amongst the Russians why am I telling you this well I'm telling you this to show you the scope of human tragedy\nI'm increasingly pessimistic about the survival of America and so that that's really what I'm getting it you may think I'm supposed to sit here and give me give you a ...\nA ... job it's a wonderful world everything's gray everything's coming up roses you take away welfare for the fifty five percent of the American people don't work\nYou take away the food stamps from the lazy bums who don't work\nYou cut off the s as the guy from the fake crazy people you'll take back all of you know how many people are on disability federal disability payments due to how many people on federal disability payments it went up on the Trump not down\n'cause they're not cracking down on the fake disability I think it was twelve or fourteen million people are faking it twelve to fourteen million people declare their to their unable to work you hit us and you're paying hundreds of billions of dollars for all of this the country is so soft that all they want is more free things you understand that\nSo then you got demagogues on the left say we'll give you anything free that you want and all of the losers of the world so yeah yeah yeah we want the free stuff will vote for them but where's the money supposed to come from where from me\nFrom the people who work that's where it comes from so what happens is when when they taxes to death and becomes too high what do you think happens you think that there's a limited money we stopped working\nWe just stop working and that's the end of it and then what's gonna happen what are you gonna do eat dirt so this is how it works unless you see the whole picture than you actually believe that Elizabeth Warren is an Indian chief\nI was reading some sue again over the weekend the art of war\nAnd he wrote some you know strategies for the feeding an enemy and one of them is make no mistake says what establishes the certainty of victory for it means conquering an enemy that has already defeated and those words resonate with me all weekend conquering an enemy that has already defeated\nSo Obama flooded America with illegal aliens for eight straight years ... he flooded us with Iranians many of whom are operatives of the enemy ...\nHas ... has operatives in America ...\nOne third of our military age men are too fat to even fight ...\nThe rest of the drug addicts or addicted to something else on the Internet and wouldn't know how to fire a gun without shooting themselves in the foot ... so you read some sue and you realize that the enemy has been working around the clock to destroy us and we're a little help from their friends in the media\nI Wonder if we could still win a war means conquering an enemy that is already defeated\nHence the skillful fight it puts himself into a position which makes defeat impossible and does not miss the moment for the feeding the enemy when will that moment come\nWe can have all of the most powerful hydrogen bombs on earth\nBut if we lack the leadership necessary to use our weapons because we've been intimidated by the Elizabeth Warren's of the world than all those weapons mean nothing you understand how that works", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "16"}
