{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Mom and dad didn't make it but she realizes well just a simple reality that family is still family no matter how it's packaged\nAnd mom and dad are still mom and dad even though they're not together and your siblings are still your siblings are So Amy just the mere fact that you called and asked shows that you're a great sister baby and I just want to encourage you to stay the course with your sister\nThings didn't work out with mom and dad but you know you can be the one to make the effort to hold that\nFamily together to be the glue that helps the family stick and so he maybe it's just a casual conversation with the phone when you guys are busy during the week but maybe it's also plan and get it on the counter we talk a lot about calendar control with families all the time on the jeopardy and show don't let the calendar will your life you control that count\nEasier said than done I Know\nIt could be that your sisters just waiting for a tax for a quick call for hey let's grab some coffee\nYou probably know a lot about your sister you you know the her favorite foods are favorite kind of movies the favorite kind of music do see a concert catch a movie you'd be doing to negotiate that relationship and I think the more you do that my hope for you is is that your sister will see\nThat man my relationship with my sister\nIt's one I don't want to lose I Know you don't want to lose it so you'd be the one\nTo make that call have you got a comment like that about your family if you\nWant to get a question in but don't want to get on the air you can be ... you can just call the studio and just talk to my producer Leviticus he'd love to get your question would try to get it on the air hey I meet ... students everywhere who struggle with or who have questions about friendships\nPencil me ask you have you asked your son or daughter how it's going with their friendships lately if not what's keeping you from doing so\nIt's a great conversation to have with your kids Amy and I check in regularly with both Bailey\nAnd Britain and about their friends and I wrote down some questions this week that we often ask our daughter's like who did you sit by lunch today what did you talk about\nThat's a very telling question to ask and we learned a lot about our daughters and their friends and just school culture just by who they sit by and the conversations that have\nHere's another one we ask her daughter ... is there anyone at school who doesn't talk with you\nBecause we'd love to know what's happened in a school that there are some relationships maybe that that they need to work on and maybe some students on campus who don't have friends were always encourage and valium bred to be a good friend\nBy reaching out to those who don't have friends here's another one we ask the any of your friends encourage you to do something you just don't want to do\nParents I find out a lot of times our kids are just waiting for us to ask those those well maybe potentially awkward questions but they're just waiting for us to approach these topics with them so that they can tell us things they really want to tell us sometimes kids just don't know how to get these issues\nAnd so look for creative ways to engage in conversation\nHere's another question that we often ask our girls have\nIs there some friends you'd like to just have over for a weekend sleep over over for a party were throwing a party and a few weakest weeks at our house and one of the reasons we do that we do it every fall and we talked about a hundred a hundred and fifty kids in our back yard and we get a DJ\nWe built a couple of fires and we have a ball and we'd love for our kids to be involved with their friends and to continue to engage in relationships with him\nHe was another question we often ask our girls how can we pray for you\nSpecifically how can we pray for your friends I Love to hear my daughter's pray for their friends if you're a person of prayer had you know prayers impactful than teaching your kids to pray for their friends\nIs a pretty powerful pattern to follow them showing your kids that their friendship list is important to you and that\nIt needs to be important to you'd listen that you can never share that message with them enough just showing them that friendships are important that you want to keep tabs on their kids you know two things happen here it keeps your your your your kids accountable first of all [noise]\nMom and dad asking questions about\nYour kids' friends it just it keeps your it keeps your kids accountable\nSecondly it gives them freedom to talk it let your kids no not me not always but many times that lets them know that hey communication can happen in our home and sometimes it just takes us asking these questions so parents don't stop asking questions\n[noise] the questions we've got ... seats tuned to deal with Jeffrey the [noise]\nSo\nYou've never heard on the dean's segment here's how it works I read an email or ... or a comment from a studio and then I respond as if I'm responding to the team to contact me this is a great opportunity for parents grandparents anyone\nWho works for students to be equipped and ready to answer similar questions are tackling similar comments\nBecause I tell you experience countless experience I've had and working with ... students in millennials they they want answers and so a student recently asked me this year it is I read a Jeffrey I Know that I have a few friends who are not in line with my faith\nAnd they encouraged me to do stuff that I Know I shouldn't I don't always agree with everything they do but if I Do spend time with them who will encourage them to live a ... a ... a a life of fate am I supposed to just turn my back\nOn them great question Hannah wrote in and she asked me that question so she's got friends are friends aren't in line with her beliefs her faith as she says I just turn my back on them because if I Do who's going to share this good stuff with them I'm asked this question\nAll the time from students so keen to dean here's how I Would answer this question here's what I Would say the head and if you doubt your friend is foolish then you you don't just want to drop them out of your life but point in your friends to your faith with out embracing there's lifestyle handed that can be very tricky\nA lot of times they can end up influencing you more than you influence them\nThe important thing is always to remember what your goal is and that's to help them become a better person specifically hand as a person of faith so it's to help this person\nEmbrace your face you know throughout his life the Bible tells us all the time that the greatest man did ever walked the planet Jesus Christ he's hung out with some pretty low people the Bible tells us that\nBut you got to remember this Jesus didn't hang with people just to hang out with him\nNo he always had an tension in every relationship he had he spent time with people for one reason\nAnd that was to see that their life was changed so if you're in this relationship Hannah and you've got a friend that's not live in a similar lifestyle you can still influence this person without always spending time with them\nYou can see him at school pat him all the bad shake their hand give him a hug you can have coffee with them now and then you can embrace a friendship with them without becoming a close\nCompanion to them but more importantly Hannah I think this is the key and for every parent listen to hope you'll share it with this with your kids to not be consistent in the life you live\nHow you live speaks much louder than words you say\nIf you say you're going to do something do it\nIf you say you're not going to do something don't do it at this friend can hides in you and tells you an in a very intimate detail in secret about their lives hold onto that if they tell you don't say anything to anyone don't say anything to anyone\nAnd then you know what just pray that God will change this person's heart how you live in shape their life so just be consistent in living\nBecause again how you lived oftentimes speaks much louder than words you actually\nSay hey before we take a break here's two great questions to ask your kid this weekend\nWho you're five closest friends\nAnd why are these people your friends think sometimes our kids just choose friends just because the French have chosen them\nThey don't put a lot of thought into Haiti who's accepted me with the influences person has all my life so after kids who are your closest friends [noise]\nAnd why are these people going [noise]\nFor instance can be a wonderful ... [noise] but they too can be costly [noise]\nThis is why parents view but they will become your kid friendship just like you have rules for social media TV Time video game time at home working for viewers last seen in more [noise] got to stay in with them when it comes to their friendships still had to be a great friend\nI'm going to tell you how to do exactly this right after the break don't go anywhere\nOn here for the family tonight this is Jeff reading I'll be right back [noise]\nThis is Joe Cornell at Cornell Cornell here are a few quick divorce tips we provide our clients sometimes email us the best way to communicate with your wife during their divorce it's efficient it creates a record and in hordes of ugly scenes on the other hand because you're on the record your comments must be tactful unreasonable assume your e mails we'll be exhibits at trial\nRemember your co throughout the process is projecting damage of common sense in good faith\nThe judge should understand that your wife is the source of this needless litigation you're the good guy the voice of reason a related point be cooperative where you can show flexibility regarding non essential issues judges noticed this besides save your attorney fees for what's important\nContact Cordell in Cordell to schedule an appointment with one of our firms Nashville area attorney so partner men can count on online that corn town Cordell dot com officers in Nashville Franklin Murfreesboro and ... court Ellen Cordell eight ten Christian Center Dr sweet one sixty Franklin, Tennessee three seven zero six seven\nHangers in vale Nashville\nMeaning this if you're in a relationship and you feel as though your character is being compromised then you've got to make that tough choice even if your friends don't follow you got to be willing to lose a relationship\nRather than lose your character we got to teach our kids to be confident in that and the more we speak competence into them the more confident they are about themselves\nBe true blue be confronted her be competed me quickly give you two more be you owe parents is is so important Austrian screen this tonight from the mountaintops we had to teach our kids be you a good friend will never require you to change something about you\nThey just won't require you to do that but yeah sometimes we got to confront them about issues that need changing but you know what I'm Talking about here are good for him will never truly pressure you to be something you don't want to be\nAnd if your son or daughter is having to listen if your son or daughter\nIs having to reinvent themselves to fit in order to be accepted by others then they're probably not in a genuine friendship\nA French should never determine your choices a fringe should never encourage you to compromise who you are and if you let them do this you're not doing your part\nTo make the friendship the best it can be parents every team needs to hear this losing yourself in order to be accepted by someone else is never the right way to go\nYou will always regret being someone other than the person you are plus explain to your child a friend will gain anything from the friendship if you simply act like they're clone\nIf you simply just be who they want you to be\nThen the friendships never really going to be a friendship you should be sharing your best qualities with your friends rather than just being the quality of person they desire you to be\nIf you have chosen your friends wisely and they was like you as you are and if they don't in my definition of friendship they really aren't true friends your kids need to hear that challenge your kids be you that fleet be good\nI'm not so sure that parents even really talk to their kids in such a way like this anymore I mean we should we should consistently be telling my kids I expect you to be good Amy kills it in our home she lays down the last time and again if you if you know my wife you know she's the sweetest person there is\nBut if you know hurting you also know that right is right or wrong is wrong if there is no compromise she is consistently I Can't stress that were developed consistently tell them Bailey and Britain we expect you to be good for instance\nI've heard a lot about the mean girls syndrome long before I had girls I heard about the main girl said to him all over America girls tell me about the mean girls stores that are going on in their lives Jamie wrote me recently just said this appreciate her admitted that she said I'm the first to admit that we girls can be really mean to each other sometimes\nSeveral girlfriends of mine and I we love each other to death but we also fight about a lot of really silly stuff I Want to be the friends that they can count on but it isn't always easy one week everything is great and then she goes on to say the next week there's backstabbing we're all getting up in each other's face her name is Jamie appreciate her saying this\nI I had girls talk to me about this\nBut until I had girls in my life I never really saw the impact of mean girls syndrome till my girls came along parents let me just say this what are you doing about this\nIf you know didn't listen you know mean girl syndrome exist to a big extent I Believe that exist\nBecause parents allow it to exist we have to be involved as parents and see the reality of the choices are kids or make him\nWe have to hold them to a high standard and how they talk and drafts and act and treat others and live if I Believe anything I Believe this mean girls syndrome is something that is learned at\nHome and they get some bad email out of this tonight but I Believe I mean girls syndrome is learned at home now I'm not saying that a mean girl gets her main from a me mom or dad ... that could happen when I Am saying is is that when a parent doesn't hold a daughter or son\nTo an expectation of character an honor and discipline\nThan that child grows up learning and believing it's my world I get what I Want and I live as a police\nI Know this both of my daughters have felt the sting\nOf mean girls syndrome they better not be the girls given up the main girl center where they're going to face the wrath of mama apparently\nWhat have you ever asked me first than to have five sisters\n... yeah is that right here that's right that's right ... five

personalities talks with everyone seems to be able to make\nFriends very easily friends on a dime you probably know that kid maybe your own\nMaybe you also know a kid who has a little bit more difficulty with this maybe it's your students who feel maybe a little little awkward insecure war when it comes to approaching people or developing relationships you know younger kids parents\nParents think about this is we were younger kids parents often managed to friendships\nYou know we organized trips with other families play dates and parties but as kids get older parents often step back in this arena some kids have no problem leading the charge when it comes to cultivating friendships as parents kind of step back but others really struggle with this and this struggle\nCan really lead to a lack of self confidence and feelings of being left out are feeling disconnected I Want to specifically to talk\nTo those parents whose son or daughter feels as though they just don't have a close friend and I I Want to make this clear\nJust because I give you these suggestions I Know this doesn't mean that your son or daughter who feels this way will super naturally become student body president next year or be the most popular kid on campus or have a thousand lakes with every post he or she both I guess that\nI Know there there are many factors at play when it comes to cold debating and keeping relationships but I Do believe that making good friends can\nBe learned and that you can teach your kids how to develop social skills that are that are really important\nTo help the friendship\nDevelopment would try to give you five we got time here before we take one of our break before we in the show tonight the first is is I tell students all over the country\nSay hey every day I like that right say hey every day we have\nA generation of students who have learned to communicate using their two thumbs and a device\nCommunication skills have all been forgotten among Gen Z students actually it probably never even fully learn them Amy and I are constantly reminding our girls just say hey the people they pass in the halls at school questions like hey would you do this weekend\nOr who do you think's going to win the world series this month or how do you feel about President Trump all can be conversations daughters that potentially lead\nTo something more so encourage your kids to be the one that just says hey to shake your head to hugging that to give somebody a knock knock or to just\nSay hey imagine the change the dynamic change\nIn our culture if we all embrace such a principled just the everyday say hey the civil and secondly use your eyes when talking\nI tell my girls this all the time just sounds so elementary but it's it's just so good when talking with someone give them your attention\nGive them your eye attention this can make all the difference in sending the message to someone I Am interested in what you are saying I think that is so important and I don't think our kids are learning is these days so many friendships today are just\nJust superficial at best and in today's teen culture mini mini change their friends as often as they change their screen saver image teach your kids\nThe importance of using their eyes when they speak and more importantly when they listen every friend once a good friend who will listen we got to teach our kids to listen with their eyes\nHow many times oh my word everyone writing yeah you know what I'm Talking about how many times have you been in a conversation with someone and you're a few moments into that conversation and that person starts\nThat their phone or starts looking somewhere else around the room and you can see just because of their eyes are on you that they checked out and we got to teach our kids the importance of communicating\nIn abusing their eyes and the lifting in that process so say hey everyday number to use your eyes when talking number three no that conflict is is really important to\nKnow that conflict as normal\nSo many kids are meet to get into fight relationships over somebody says something someone gets their feelings hurt and it's just done so many kids I Know so many kids probably you know maybe your kids half of the population of ... students live in a divorce told\nMany of these students have grown up here in in watching mom and dad's fight\nThey live with the sting of knowing at least in their home the fighting ended in mom and dad no longer live together so their view of conflict is extremely jaded\nThey need to know that conflict doesn't always mean the end of her relationship this is so important parents stress to them even if you've gone through a divorce stress of them that even the best of friends are going to disagree but\nBut disagreements don't have to end friendships teach our kids how to disagree respectfully talk about ways they can agreed to talk about ways they can agree to disagree\nTake a break up from the conversation with things just get heated teach your kids how to walk away from a fight better than staying in a fight just to win rather than just fighting to win failure doesn't have to mean the friendship is over sometimes we fail one another\nBut we have to teach our kids the conflict as normal the conflict isn't the deal\nThe deal is how do we teach our kids to handle that conflict number four learned to just say I am sorry powerful words that every kid needs to learn\nLearn learn to just say I'm Sorry when was the last time there's a there's a great thought for you when was the last time you talk with your son or daughter about the right way to say the two powerful words I'm Sorry\nIn this point your finger at someone culture blame everyone else played the blame game it's really important I think that we teach our kids the importance of owning up and admitting fault\nWhen they've done wrong how many marriages how many friendships how many relationships are destroyed\nEvery day because two people can't say these two very powerful words I'm Sorry I have a very close friend of mine she lives in another state\nAnd several years ago the ... the British that just went sideways and it broke her heart and broke my heart\nIt's not in your school I Would encourage it just to shut that down tonight just make a mental note of this and maybe right it's somewhere if you're there at home listening tonight or maybe you're at work of course if you're driving don't ride right now but there's a great ... called stop it it's an anonymous reporting ap students use this app specifically on their campuses\nTo report about a dangerous or hurtful action either they're making\nOr a friend they know is making through the ap\nStudent can send the chat message about

they need more than one hundred and eighty schools in Tennessee right now\nAre using the app if your school is not again you may want to speak up speak out about this app it's called stop it really really powerful app and you know since we're talking about being good friends tonight\nI Want to encourage every parent listening to put this number and your phone\nAnd to give it to your student to put in his or her phone is the national suicide prevention lifeline one eight hundred two seven three eight to five five a national suicide prevention lifeline one eight hundred two seven three eight to five what a tremendous act\nOf a friend that had this number and then to share this number with another friend\nWho your son or daughter believes might be in a life and death situation I Hope you'll consider getting this number shared it with your friends maybe posted on social media and all the friends the parents within your circle just kind of remind them give them a little nudge about the importance of this is a great way to pay it forward you may never have to\nThis number your kids may never need this number of their friends\nMay never need this number but you know what all it takes is one kid in one struggle in one situation what a great act of friendship to have that number that national suicide lifeline to give to your kids so they can share it with their friends again it's one eight hundred two seven three\nEight to five\nFive days we wrap the show tonight I Want to share an email with you that I received on October seventeenth I just got this email just this week

viewers could see this tonight\nBut wherever you are how I Hope you listen to this email or a parent recently wrote me and he said this is a jeopardy I recently just found your podcast by the way our podcast as family strong podcast which every day all podcast platforms\nFamily strong pod cast with Jeffrey name he says I recently found your podcast I've had the pleasure of listening to you speak now on the radio and I love\nYour show he said he specifically listen to a podcast from a few weeks ago the show where I mentioned this he said when you suggested to look through old photos with your kids to connect with them it put a smile on my face\nHe said just a week ago my daughters and I were down in the basement going through boxes and I came across in old photo of me sitting on my father's lap\nAs I showed it to my kids I noticed that my dad had wrote on the back of the photo he wrote please give the green paper to your mother\nI'm guessing this was a child support check and I remember that my father wrote this down and I remember that moment and then he said my dad he also wrote on the back of the paper remembered that I Will always love you\nFather goes on to say this he says my dad rarely came around and when he did it just was not pleasant at all he was ... he was addicted to drugs and alcohol\nAnd then his father goes on to say this but as I read the back of the picture I started to to Europe and I told my kids would even though my father was not the best role model when I was a kid the one thing I learned from him is that didn't want to be like him\nAnd I'd always promised myself that have got every blessed me with kids I Would never let them build the way about me\nThat I feel about my dad\nAnd it's because my childhood was rough and I miss so much with my dad and I never want to be that bad I Know it sounds a little weird but sitting down and looking at pictures with my kids\nA picture of my dad for thirty five years ago reminded me to be a great father rather than following my daddy's footsteps to break that chain\nTo be the dead my kids need me to be not a powerful email\nParents I just want to remind you tonight this father has a reminder

United States from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia and says Russia is not living up to the agreement\nAs long as somebody is violating the agreement then we're not going to be the only one I think he went to\nTallahassee running okay ah the Democrat was up nine points and then there was a poll Mason Dixon on the twenty seventh and ... just he's just a point now I haven't seen anything in the October\nAnd this is post capital will this affect the ... the governor's race this is Rhonda Sanders of course congressman who's running for governor of Florida will this have any bearing on that what it looks to me like it looks to me like the Democrat is losing ground now I haven't seen the Santa's going ahead it's probably too close to call this\nPoint but that's another one they told me to look at it I'm looking at it and what I see is it appears to be a trend\nIt appears to be that the Democrats are trending down and the Republicans are trending up am I going to make a prediction for November six\nOh no oh no no no no\nBecause I learned my lesson they because then you you said well I I stay on the best information possible not telling you that's going to happen and then people getting you know they blame me when somebody doesn't win like it's my fault no I'm just telling on the best information that we have\nBut right now it looks like it's trending toward\nThe uh the Republicans I'm trying to talk to you and grab another this when vox nine out enough votes as far left so we'll see what the the Thirteen most important governor elections in twenty eight team\nAnd Florida happens to be one of them\nAnd seeing the main out on the moon and see where they got the latest maybe they got something in the October I Can't imagine there aren't pulled this than real clear politics doesn't have anything after September twenty seven I Can't imagine that there's not something after that\nWell let's see what Scott Walker\nComing [laughter] ... okay who's to them and we don't care\nUh Ohio I don't think we've got any polling data they're just giving a rundown of who's who\nSo if we can get the latest from the polling data how red and green slung okay yeah he's something that may help the Republicans and certainly\nA Rick Scott is how they handle this thing with with the hurricane that's always that's always a big deal I mean people go OK if you're going to be one of my elected officials how'd you do you know how'd you do handling this\nAnd say okay\nHere's into this from Seattle seems that this is amazing now you folks in Florida may have seen something but I'm looking at the latest polling I don't see anything in October this is a huge deal it's a big deal\nAnd there's not any polling data for October for crying out loud we're in the middle of October this is a oh come on that's bound to be but what I'm telling you the latest I saw\nIs that it looked like it was trending down for the Democrats will see how it turns out of course if the Republicans lose ... if not the end of the world although I think any time a Democrat takes over state it's not good for the state I can tell you that but it depends on what he's working with as far as the legislature and all the rest\nOf it but what I'm telling you is when they tell me to look at race in Minnesota and I do and the race in Minnesota tells me that the Republican\nHas made a sixteen point turnaround in the last month I'm not saying that this is the only race to look at what I'm what I'm what I'm Wondering is is this the proverbial canary in the coal mine\nThat nobody now is paying attention to because it's going so strong for the Republicans and this is just one poll but it's the New York times\nAnd that's the only polling operation I can see this polling in that district I'm sure they got some internal polls with the campaign themselves but um you know as far as that's concerned\nAnyway now on to the other stuff the sixty minutes interview and Elizabeth Warren says she actually has some Indian blood\nHow much though this I'll\nGive you this first when the Boston Globe was going to be slanted in her direction\nSenator Elizabeth Warren released a DNA test that provide strong evidence she had a Native American and her family tree dating back six to ten generations and unprecedented move by one of the top possible contenders for the twenty twenty Democrat nomination for president\nWarren who's planes to Native American blood have been marked by President Trump than other Republicans provided the test results of the globe on Sunday\nAnd an effort to diffuse questions about our ancestry that have persisted for years she planted elaborate rollout today she probably already has\nA aimed for widespread attention the analysis of warns DNA was done by Carlos Bustamante at Stanford University professor an expert in the field who won the twenty ten MacArthur Fellowship also known as a genius grant\nFor his work on tracking population migration via DNA Analysis he concluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but he added that quote the results strongly support the existence of and on and mixed Native American ancestor\nPick out the Warren's pure and Native American ancestor appears in her family tree and the range of six to ten generations ago that timing fits Warren's family lore passed down during or Oklahoma upbringing\nThat are great great great grandmother oh see Sarah Smith was at least partially Native American\nSmith was born in late Seventeen hundred she denied his flight in historical documents there was a time Indians face discrimination and Smith would have strong incentives to call herself white if possible\nSo if OC Smith Sara Smith and now she's next thing she goes to save grandmother wrote little green apples both uh that'll be safe\n[laughter]\nIf she were fully Native American or Indian that would make Warren one thirty second negative but of course she's not she just had a ... so\nWhat they're saying is she's between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American\nSo I had somebody out there who sent me this let me see if we can grab this where the yeah says ah you should know this\nThe Cherokees and North Carolina require one sixteenth six point two five percent to be considered a Cherokee in North Carolina she grew up in Oklahoma which would make her a descended from the United or\nIs it keep to wall Cherokee Indians I Apologize for mispronouncing the name K. E. T. O. W. A. each kid to a\nCherokee Indians they require one fourth blood line for a dollar twenty five percent the Cherokee Nation does not stipulated\nPercentage because they lost track of the rules with all of the inter marriage therefore being from Oklahoma she should have twenty five percent bloodline bottom line she is like a mutt like most of the rest of us are\nAnd she possibly committed fraud for getting into college claiming a minority groups you ask you a professorship flaming she was Indian\nAnd I say and if he was in his Native American it's Indian\nCongreve I'm a Native American for crying out loud we're all if you were born here you're Native Americans have done this thing women Native American\nA I'm a ... the Indians are black folks white folks there Jews you know they're

to hold on to grab a hold on a\nShow for it and uh about the number of people who were actually just done with this whole thing about political correctness was that friday or Thursday and we got an expert tomorrow Scott I'm going to come and talk about it\nAnd the ... a vast majority of Americans are sick the death of political correctness yeah that's that's what I Can't find the story right now but trust me that is true which were sick the death of political correctness and so everybody has a hyphenated this or you\nCan Sandy and against the Native American\nLands amazingly weird over and over again is ... gets allergy so here is another story on this whole Elizabeth Warren saying because now there are other folks saying\n... she ain't really an Indian\nThis is from legal insurrection dot com just giving you the source\nSays that a ground becomes very very unnerving uh-huh okay\nWe don't know I'm Elizabeth Warren is not Native American ancestry has been traced by Cherokee

I I told you this long with Kanye and the black community too when when you start hearing this uh I'm not crazy about Trump much and I think you're hearing that with a lot of folks\nThey are they going you know All right\nLet's just let the guy go I told you this the other day I'm Talking to somebody I always tell the vast staff here I was talking to somebody who was not a they hadn't been Trump and they become a Trump fan but they were not a Trump fan the main reason they weren't a Trump fan\nIs because of that Access Hollywood tape and so we're sitting there talking about it and I don't even know\nThat he realized this but as he's telling me about the whole thing and he's getting really ginned up and excited about everything\nHe's using some very colorful language now what if I took of a a secret tape and I don't ... I never do that but what if I were secretly taping our conversation\nAnd just happened to send it to his boss or send it to his board of directors or whatever and say listen to this languages guy was using and I'm not saying anything wrong with I mean this is the way a lot of guys talk and some ladies to whatever the ladies but some women\nIn private\nAnd it was the same thing I was sitting there thinking do you hear yourself because you're using this kind of and that wasn't you know like grab 'em in the whatever\nBut Trump was saying that not\nEver thinking that anybody else was listening other than Billy Bush and never dreaming that was going to be made\nPublic have you ever said something in private that you would cringe if somebody outside the conversation with that other person you're talking about ever heard well that's the whole point and this guy is now a convert to Trump it was ironic that that kind of language\nWas what was upsetting to and I remember the time and go I was shocked but then when you stop and think okay fill up your average what I've never seen anything quite like that but there's no telling what Johnny B and I say\nI Know John exist to cringe themself or Johnny B and I say privately that if it got on the air well we would go oh oh sorry [laughter] but that was meant for the ...\nWell that's the whole thing\nBetween the Access Hollywood tape which I think was probably the low point of Trump's whole campaign and political career well I don't know Stormy Daniels\nYou know comes it's a tough one although the story that he keeps denying that but I mean this is something that we heard right that we could put our hands well a bad choice of words um that we could it was something tangible that we could listen to and make a judgment call on\nAnd I think when we do that we go oh well at the end of the day that could be anybody couldn't it I'm not saying that it's the it's like the Shiite whole comment about the countries I don't know where they said that or not\nBut people like um oh what's his face they are a former and see Michael Steele ... it was like yeah Michael Steele\nAll upset about that that he would refer to some of these foreign nations are Shiite holes well that's where they are now you don't say that out in public but he didn't if in fact he did say this\nThis was to a choice few people sitting around in a meeting about what to do about poverty in some of these places and sending money and throwing good money after bad and the rest of it\nSo he's just he's just telling it like it is and most of us would agree and as you look back on these nations that he was talking about\nWell he was talking about some of the nation's in any actually means all of them that he mentioned we're in the top twenty of Shiite holes from from the list of Shiite holes for the UN they don't call it that is the poorest nations on earth and they are dumps\nAnd and Donald Trump was talking about that they aren't safe for Michael Steele to get upset about some private conversation but I think all of this\nIs blown is blowing over and people looking in the economy and the going you know okay some of the guys got a rough mouth look at all this prosperity will [noise]\n\nMm this is ... some on I played football for the\nPhiladelphia Eagles but what I Do off the field with United Way might be more important I'm a

somebody called agree with them that's fine I always taught I always thought I told my kids are taught my family you know ... and I was taught it's OK got to agree with anybody has your opinion everybody spoke either opinion but this hatred you know they they wanna blame it on Trump and it's just\nPointing in the wrong direction they all loved him until he decided to run for office you know what he's done you know he's done for a smart he's he's kept his promises he's the first president in my lifetime to try to keep every time understanding they touch it\nThat's all he's done try to keep every promise I talk to you whether whether whether whether what his thoughts are good or bad\nHe promised in his delivery now I I I I'm I'm shocked I'm appalled I you know what he promised to all the people I think people are just they want to wall\nYou know ... and it's shocking that that the other that that my own party who left me doesn't even see that it was only twenty or Thirty years ago that they wanted a wall\nTo wall and he's fighting to save the word is where the left to go it's just it it to me it's it's insane I I'm not going to I I I refuse to change\nBut I won't vote that direction I'll I'll vote a big are all the way\nI Want to see Tom Carper out of office in Delaware I'm I'm hoping that that happens it won't\nBut but I ... I just can't I Can't imagine how people especially the blacks in Delaware and I saw it I I I I how how pamphlets out for people on voting day a spot for eight years ago and and it didn't matter what you did they all just\nThey pulled the de lever all the way down they don't even know who they're voting for\nYeah they've been so thanks for your call I appreciate very much the it's a it's a motion in my opinion on the other side they just a\n... it's just a visceral reaction you know Republicans are bad and Republicans are evil Democrats are good and if you care about the common man you'll you'll vote Democrat and it takes I was a Democrat who originally I teased and say it was a birthright in Brooklyn New York you had no choice\nBut when you realized way as you get older and you grow you see that that's not the case that are actually the Republican solutions are far better in in the long run than the emotional reaction of hope and change or whatever you come up with but it does I must admit it it really bothers me to see that\nYour daughter doesn't talk to you and it's just a it's a sad maybe let's go to the gallon in I'm Sorry a Miguel in Corpus Christi\nHow you doing today sir real well\nYou know I'm I'm a libertarian or I go to college so I'm not Republican and I'm not Democrat and I got to be honest with you you know I've heard it from both sides you know I've been called a racist in a big it and what have you from the left and you know I call it because you know\nA snowflake you know from the right and I think it's really come down to this country is being torn apart it seems like to me um by their politics it seems that people are kind of unable to sit down and just you know\nDiscuss politics and work towards you know a a better in America you know together and I will have to say I'm not trying to figure out but\nThe Republicans in the right wing or almost just as bad about it is\nYeah I don't see that as so by the way I was thinking I was listening to what you said and you said snowflake and I'm thinking snowflake is not to like calling someone a racist or a big hit your people and I it and you could be a snowflake and being on the Republican side just means\nYou know things offend you got upset easily you can't handle things I don't mind being called a snowflake it's not anything like being called a racist or homophobic or anything else the snowflake with those things I even like snowflakes so even your comparison except the are laughing you agree with me\nI mean I understand um you know\nThat is a good point uh I guess I didn't think of it that way but you know also I think a lot of you know ... from what I see that the problem stem from also a kind of I'm not really being able to hold your candidate accountable\nAnd I think that's one thing that you know Republicans and the right we could do to further their message and I think it would help you out so much more to kind of get your ideas out there of course is just my opinion but a caller earlier at you know commented on the second amendment and I'm very pro second I'm\nYou know you have a right wing or is like you said that really are Second Amendment we you know if that's what you agree and you want to ban bump stocks and you want to raise you know the age of Twenty one and that's fine but that's not something you agree with a mean old your candidates accountable to that I Would think\nIt's funny you say that because it's funny I have a different view I think that Republicans do turn on their own much more than Democrats to ... ah remember at the health care vote it was all Democrats not one Republican\nOr Bill Clinton impeachment the none of the Democrats would sign on Kavanaugh you had one Democrat who the Trump won by forty points in West Virginia and so you can understand why he may have voted for his nomination\nIf the Democrats the less that really stick together whereas we I don't know you've never heard me before but George W Bush's example is position on illegal immigration I could never accept that there's so many things and a lot of us disagreed with him in Iraq\nWe do it and go against her own so I just want you to see I have a different view I think that we do hold them accountable I I couldn't stand Lindsey Graham's position on illegal immigration but he was a great on Capitol\nUh I I think our side really does hold these people accountable and the other side doesn't isn't that funny depends on your perspective what age are you how old are you\nSir I'm Twenty years old\nYeah you're very articulate I thought you were young but I think as I could be wrong but if you check out our politics you continue to follow this stuff\nI think you'll see that people on my side conservatives Republicans we as an example we don't we don't have ... people would you finding that out um even on social media we I don't care what if you're a you know I'd I'd marry someone who was conservative that that shared my I mean that was a liberal let your mind values\nBut I don't you can see the other side doesn't feel the way they hate the President Trump and people who side with them so much that they're willing to abandon their the daughters willing to abandon the father\nI don't see that side hey ma Galileo I had no longer if Ptolemy and mark has to show dot com if you listen to me longer I have a feeling after a while I could just the big maybe might or\nWhat do you think okay for you and thank you so much thanks mckell and there was a lot of fun talking to you and I want to\nTalk to the rest of you at eight

tired but I'm forty five now she is about to be forty one we drove super tight um\nI mean she I was always the one being told they take your sister with your ... el ... everywhere I had to go you know my sister went and I look back now and I absolutely love that you know and um\nWhat we're really tight all the way through and um you know similar I think it was my senior year my parents got divorced and so we got a little you know a state of my dad or mom and and we got a little separation but we never let the distance or um\nGet it between us we stayed in contact and uh she became a flight attendant for a for a flight attendant shooting and you know she would let me use our faster than we would fly ... yeah and um and then you know slowly as family comes in you know you can\nMaybe don't talk as much but we always talk and um\nAnd we always had the same views for the longest time you know maybe a couple of little differences here and there but um she started traveling a lot to Europe and this that and come back started talking about how you know America does the U.S does this wrong or in the u._s. should\nBe more like this country and this and that is so you know it just kind of like OK okay whatever well um we never really talked about politics until this past election and um and still during the primaries um\nYou know I hadn't made my choice that I think most people you know they had made a choice and I was between crews ... ... and as she was more of a Bernie Sanders she knows\nAll about Bernie Sanders and um she was happy with Hillary and so as it got closer and closer when I actually started leaning orders trial\nWe we started I think there's serious serious debates you know and then I'm In June my son my youngest son was graduating\nAs she was supposed to come out to the graduation and um\nMy son and her just had a tremendous tremendous uh a relationship and um\nTwo weeks prior to the um to the graduation we had a conversation on a song or like a you know what where you get here when I got to talk about politics and this is about politics is about my son graduation and um and then two weeks before the graduation she called\nAnd she said because I'm a Trump supporter she can't come to my house and we have not spoken since that day and I I've reached out or a couple of ...\nAnd a couple of times you know China is a a a relationship with my nephew who it nothing nothing\nI feel so sorry few I I you know it just breaks my heart and and you have to wonder what what about your son I mean she didn't seem to care about that either\nThat the the fact that you just pour Trump was enough to break a bowl the relationship between the brother and sister in ... so much over those years\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I I just uh you know ... cliche it is hard to even hear the story\nDo don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the ... got in fact I was down in socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw\nA but it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time just hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way\nI worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said\nI don't want to say too much about it except one of the hosts had a ... have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a hundred and Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him because she disowned him all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that eventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family story as a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics they disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen and it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael
