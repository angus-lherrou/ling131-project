comment concern you can find me all social media as I Am jeopardy and in my personal email is Jeffrey Jeffrey dean dot com so she rushed me to say this I recently read an article written by Mr dean concerning teens and pornography\nRecently found out that my Thirteen year old son was introduced to porn by accident I hear this all the time by the way all the time I hear this my son Thirteen Years old was introduced to porn but I accidently finding it simply researching a homework assignment on line\nShe goes on to say unfortunately it has led to him going back for more and more of this stuff my husband are scared\nYou've never thought in our wildest imagination that are so would get caught up in porn now I see how quickly it can happen I'd like to know if there's some information Mr dean might have a recommend that you can help with this situation for our son thank you for somebody said his mom dad everyone listening tonight please notice you are not alone\nWe hear from people every week of all ages\nEvery week of all ages who are struggling with Florida you know someone who is I Know this doesn't lessen you're hurting or your concern but look there is much you can do to help your son or your daughter\nIn my book the fight of your life or parents I have an entire chapter on this very issue actually I've got two chapters lawn on how to deal with the issue of porn in one on specifically safeguard in your home from pornography\nThis is a very heavy issue we're seeing across the board hands down this has been number one issue teen boys talk to me about number three issue teen girls touch me about\nIt look on do before I give you some bobsled is I Know that just because I talk about it just because I give you some bullet points on the radio doesn't mean you're going to clean it all up overnight get that\nAnd this poor stuff's it's heavy and if your if your team's in the poor look it probably didn't develop overnight their addiction probably not going to go away overnight with every look every image they're going deeper and deeper and that's what drew me tonight you do not have time to waste\nI've yet to counsel hope everyone is here and this and I I've yet to counsel with anyone of any age struggling with poor desires to continue struggling nobody wants to be inflated the stuff nobody wants to remain on the road the destruction\nBut also found this mini who desire to escape from the bonding to which they are living have little knowledge of how to overcome its rap\nIf you're Tina struggle a porn let me give us some help number one you got to get the facts I've got all this ... dot com slash IM jeopardy not put a link there tonight to several blogs\nA website where we tackled pornography in my book to fight a real life is sold everywhere books are so we have an Amazon author page Jeffrey D and you can go to jeopardy dot com and grab one of the books if you don't have money for one of these books and you need them emailed me Geoffrey Geoffrey dot com will get a book to you\nThis is serious stuff and you listen number one you got to get to the fact it's essential that you know about it that you know about the dangers and that you're willing to approach your kid all this stuff if you don't\nWho will one of the foundational truce of this show and for everything I Believe all want to share with you is this you are the most\nInfluential person in your teens life did you hear this you're the most influential person in your team's life more than any friend unique coach a teacher a pastor a boyfriend or girlfriend jock star pop star teens overwhelmingly tell me mom and dad\nGreatest influence in my life [noise] parents listen to the question is do you influence rather what is your employer\nParents talk about porn and sexuality what their team but they do it indirectly look you can't dance around the stuff\nYou've got to get right to the point you got to be specific you got to share with them the affects porn will have on their life at detail all of this uh ... dot com you go to ... dot com slash blog you search the board pornography odd detailed the effects poor will have on your kid's life\nEven if you do not suspect your team is involved in poor like this mom from Ohio who email me\nI encourage you don't wait to have the talk\nAs far as I Know my girls I've got a teen fourteen another who is sixteen as far as I Know they've never been impacted by pornography\nBut I Know it's just a click away for them and to some point they will be exposed to this if they were sitting in the studio night they would tell you they jump on them I can tell your mom and dad talk to us about this stuff we have to remember if your kid spins anytime on line at all\nIt is inevitable that at some point they will be exposed to the raw deal the multibillion dollar a year business of porn\nIf you've caught your team in the act at first but they may denied that this struggle exit exist or they may try to minimize its effects on their life here's the deal is this critical that you explain to your team that porn we'll get you hooked\nWhen an awesome moment this can be to strengthen your relationship with them to be the one willing to hit the stuff with them to help them develop a plan to protect them from the harm\nSo look you've you've got to get the facts and here's the deal you got to follow the facts up with this three words I Love you wherever you are tonight listening three words I Love you got to tell your kids desk whether we're talking poorer whether we're talking or whatever\nI Know you know this and I sure would remind you that your kids need to hear these three words and hear them often particularly if they've got a secret if they had a struggle\nAs you implement some of these steps on I'm going to give you you need to know this there's there's a fight that's going to follow because there's this darkness in the world today have pornography and it's going to buy like mad if it's already sunk its claws into your into your kid's head\nThere's listen there's a there's a dark there because I tell kids once you download this stuff into your membrane it's very difficult to delete those images every single person listening right now if you've ever checked out porn intentionally or accidentally\nRight now wherever you are if you close your eyes ... unless you're driving but if you close your eyes or if you're driving don't know close your eyes but just let you remembering go there right now if you've ever check the stuff that you can probably hit rewind and your head\nYou can go back and you can recall some of the last images you looked at it could've been five years ago\nCould've been a week ago could've been ten years ago\nYou may not can recall every image every website ever you are out\nBut right now you know unproven truth to you you can hit rewind and your membrane that you could go back and you can see some of those images because as I tell kids once ... once you hit click once you download those images into your membrane it is very difficult to delete those images from your brain hard drive\nAnd said listen you need to help communicate to your teen and tell them off that I Love you I'm In this with you no matter how deep and ... and dark the trail is that you're on I Want you to know my love for you has\nNot changed\nThe needy one one number three realize this is a big one ... that a promise isn't enough you got hit the facts you got to tell them I Love you and the number three you got to realize that a promise from your kid isn't enough because because here's what we're seeing across the country what teens talk to us about this stuff\nWhen your team's been caught in the act parents have told us this all of the country often the first quick response is to plead for forgiveness to apologize and to promise\nI'll never do it again\nI Will go back there\nI'll never do it again\nI tell your parents I I Can't stress enough the desire maybe genuine\nIt may be a re pencils spirit in in their voice but our experience says otherwise that it will only be a matter of time before the addiction wins them over again unless there is someone there to journey with him for a team struggling with porn a promise to change\nHangers in vale Nashville\nStudio where dogs I mean I [noise]\nArms sales to the Saudis looting in Florida I'm Evan hanging on Capitol Hill many lawmakers of\nBoth parties are demanding from action following the disappearance of Washington Post journalist and Saudi critic ... but President Trump is holding this is against

other things we can do that are very very powerful very strong and will do that\nUnder US law major military sales can be blocked by Congress and correspondent Elise Lapid says the U.S faces other hard choices\nFor the amount of time [noise]\nI got another email forest and I we had one from a pair and Ohio earlier but I I just received this email from a parent in Minnesota and no one we were going to be on the air lot tonight I Want to read it to you she said that's my daughter Samantha was in Wisconsin where you spoke this winter\nI have a feed him where she's where she's talking about 'cause I go to Wisconsin off and actually I was just there just last week she says is one of you know that you have changed not only her life\nBut our entire family and that's pretty encouraging here she said we've been struggling with some typical teens stuff she's going through there is some emotional issues she's been having it she says your words and understanding has completely inspired her\nChanged her complete view on life she goes all the right inspiration hope and faith or the prime factors everyone needs and our Sam has started to regain some of these so thank you and then she says is she says Jeffrey one issue we're seeing continually surface\nIs the guy stuff\nShe almost always seems to your boyfriend and this is really concerned to her father and I my fear and she'd be it'll be really vulnerable here over listen to this she said my fear is that this need for male companionship\nMight lead her to make choices with a boyfriend that she might regret for her life how should we approach all of this\nWith her appreciate this\nThis pair to Minnesota sharing this with me we you know we we see this stuff we continually see this stuff and the question of\nWell just the whole dating life and when the kids jump in and what is the appropriate age him what about all the sex stuff and we're seeing it everywhere let me let me give you three things before we take a break here and for every parent listen tonight if if you've got a teen who's dating who was thinking about dating by the way let me just remind you\nNothing should be off limits when it comes to your kids dating life and you should remind him an Arab this\nYou\nAre not a bad parent you are not a nag you are not old school if you were asking questions about your kids Daniel life he or she needs guidance from you so let me give me three days number one you got to talk openly with your daughter just as you spoke with me\nYou know what I'm saying that specifically to the ... who wrote me this email\nThat truly for all parents tonight this this pair it was very vulnerable with me she shared with me some of the challenges that her daughter's having in in her dating life and this need for milk companionship to number one talk to your daughter just like you talked with me let her see your concern\nShe needs to hear from you that you want what's best for her so talk to her there's nothing sometimes parents are so concerned I don't I don't want to upset my I Want to upset my kids when my kids are like me parents let me remind you your your kid does not need another ...\nThey don't need you to be the ...\nThey need you to be the parent so easier said than done I get it I Want my girls to love me my two daughters I Want them to think daddy's the coolest thing ever\nBut I Know more than my desire that they like me I Know what is more important that they use your truth from me this means that sometimes what they hear from me they're just not gonna like\nParents we gotta love I Hope every parent listening to that here's this parents we get all of our kids so much the world case sometimes that they don't like us\nI should put that on the shirt we should sell that shirt we love our kids so much but sometimes we are okay and they don't like us so if you got to talk to your daughter just as openly as you've shared with me the story of her struggle secondly clearly articulate your expectations as parents\nWhether it's in their sex life their homework life what they watch on TV how much time they're on Snapchat\nHow much time they're on Netflix you got to clearly articulate your expectation specifically do for their daily life for her sex life I tell my daughters over and again we expect you to say no\nTo old school but it's still the safe sex way of living it is the only safe sex way of living say no to sex and do marriage I think this is where most perished dropped the ball they want what's best for their children but often miss the mark in articulating such so you've got to clearly\nClearly articulate your expectations let me give you know there's another point we'll take a break remind\nYour daughter specifically to know guys worth of compromise\nIf you've got a son remind your son at the same no one is worth the compromise of your purity of your integrity of your value of your character you will never let me say it again you will

Cooper and you probably know where I'm going to her because she's been in the headlines a lot this week Twenty one year old nearly Reinhardt she plays Betty Cooper on Riverdale she took to Twitter this week to say this and I quote feeling really disheartened\nBy the fact that so many people are saying\nYour skinny so shut up about a bracing your body\nIn the court\nRuled that again she says I'm feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying your skinny so shut up about embrace in your body\nSo I think there's been some talk via her her Twitter feed where she's been talking about some frustrations she has with her body and looking at herself and I think there's been some well some responses to that because people obviously looking at her and would call her a ... a ... a fee in person she went on to say this she says\nI Am dealing with what is known as body ... disorder\nAnd she says if my body just for you is irrelevant because of how I look to some people I mean they're not Kirby enough or on the skinny enough so I I feel insecure she says is it doesn't matter how you perceive my body\nMy disorders my feelings bad as me this is how I feel about me who are you to tell me to shut up it's a very interesting conversation she's making the point that no she may look skinny to some people she may not feel that way so quit telling her how she should perceive\nHer own body oh I Love her thoughts and it really brings up this issue I Want us to approach here in the last half hour of the show because I meet so many people especially young girls who share with me their own personal body disparate challenges\nReality is most teens and millennials Amit struggle in some way with their body on some level\nHas thanks to pop culture so many of our kids are dealing with this stuff\nI mean there's so many kids dealing with the reality of looking in the mirror feeling as though they not measure up looking at someone else feeling as though they don't have and looking at the cover of a ... a magazine or an interview with the ... movie star\nThis body this for a challenge this this or that Mr Reinhart is kind of brought to the center stage this week and pop culture\nI Love it if I Want to talk about tonight this is the fall of the family segment\nCalming all for each time for a phone fast [noise]\nAll told me she said wait a second in the middle of a conversation with her thirty a conversation about life struggles and thoughts and your name and we tackled him\nShe said just wait a second Jeffrey I Want people to like me ... boys the lightning\nAnd the only way to get Boyce alive and listen what she said the only way to get boys to like me is to be pretty and thin and sexy that stuff is important I'd spoken at night at this team conference about the things that are really important and she told me in jeopardy hold on this ... this is really important\nAnd you know here's here's Russia where they're sure that there's nothing wrong with wanting to look good to be liked\nBut there is something wrong with thinking that how you look or how popular you are is the most important thing in the world\nThe thing that defines who you are and the thing that gives you value\nBecause you know what you start thinking that way and suddenly you also start thinking that without those two hundred dollar jeans you'll just die or that you don't lose Fifteen pounds before\nFrom then you just won't look good you just won't like yourself you know what parents we have to remind our kids the constant pursuit for more stuff better body more popularity\nThat pursuit will never satisfy\nBecause that pursuit never ends and it's often leads to a life of regret\nYou know I really have to believe speaking of regret I Believe our kids are exhausted\nI really believe this generation so many of them they're just they're exhausted and many of them they're exhausted with their regrets everyone has regrets maybe maybe you regret not staying in school maybe you regret not pursued a different career maybe you regret wearing\nThose really tied black parachute pants your junior year of high school and the school wide talent shows you saying Barry metals weekend in New England love song\nOkay maybe that maybe that's my regret nonetheless we we we all have regrets we focus so much on the decisions we make in a moment you hear I found this very interested in a new study published in the journal emotion I'll put this link on my face but pace tonight but this new study published in the journal emotion indicates the the old adage\nReally does still ring true it's not the things you do in life that you regret listen to this\nTheir results where it's not the things you do in life that you regret it's often the things you don't do\nThat makes sense really connect with me in this study Cornell psychologist identified three elements that make up a person's sense of self there's your actual self which consist of qualities that you believe you possess there's\nYour ideal self which is made up of the qualities you want to have and then\nThere's your all self and this is the person you feel you should have been so your actual self which consist of qualities you believe you possess secondly your ideal self and this is made up the qualities you want to have\nAnd then there's the ... the person you feel you should have been in surveying the responses of hundreds of participants in these studies actually they did six studies these researchers found that people all over the country when asked to name their single biggest regret in life\nSo good when asked to name their single biggest regret in life almost eighty percent of participants said it was in not fulfilling their ideal self\nThat that that part of their of their person made up of the qualities that they want to have the person they want to be the things they wanted you know we got this this indicates that we might\nHave a flaw attitude toward how to avoid regret we live in this thought about this this week we've we live in a world in which we're told that will have a great life if we follow certain rules so you figure that if you do all the things that\nWill that society expects of you know you you act like a good citizen and you pay your bills on time you get married at the appropriate time you you make enough money to pay your bills on time we we had this belief that if you know if we follow the sets of rules that will will feel fulfilled\nBut those are all the qualities associated with your ought self which the study found people have limited regrets about but when it comes to your dreams your aspirations people are more likely to let them just drift but really kind of be unreal lives in ... I guess this study is really saying that's kind of what stings later in life\nReally kind of point into the reality that to me in this study that\nIt's not enough to encourage people just to do the right thing this study is proof to me that it's vital for many people to really choose to do more with their lives in the short people regret their actions more than their actions but in the long term the inaction based upon this study\nThose regrets stick around longer\nAnd I got to tell you in my experience in speaking with parents everywhere I Would agree wholeheartedly with this research as it relates to parenting\nI've had countless conversations with parents who told me such things as I mean I Wish I Would have parents had better when my kids lived at home I Wish I would've spent more time with my kids wish I'd have been at the office less with my kids more or I hear this and all of them I Wish I could go back and do it over\nAnd have been at work less I'd have been with my kids more\nYou know what I've I've probably made these comments before too I look at my daughter's they're sixteen they're fourteen and I think where these years go what kind of done differently in their younger years what we can do better now you know I think the take home I Want to leave with you tonight isn't one of regret instead\nIt's one of responsibility rather than thinking about this rather than regretting what has or has not happened what if we each pair it'd in such a way that will regardless of the past our idea was moving forward he can do now\nWhat can I Do today better than I did yesterday\nHow can I be more engaged in my kids' lives are going to spend more time with with my wife with with my husband with with my children what if\nEach of us listening tonight shows to commit a little more time each day to talk\nTo be together to ask simple questions like how was your day what happened today that was funny or would you do today\nThat you hope you'll never forget as a parent\nI have a responsibility to go there to not just be there but to go there to be to be present to engage to ask these questions that hopefully entice conversation look I I Know my kids when it comes down to it they don't really care how much I make\nI mean as I say that lightly because I Know that men are you sure what a whole lot of stuff but when it comes out do they they really care less about what I make and I know when it comes to a book out right and then they don't care they're not doubt into that of where I go speak I Do know what they care about is that on President in their lives\nThey care that I care did you hear that daycare that I care about what's going on in their lives\nAnd I can show that I care and so many ways I'm sure working to be a pair he goes to distance with my kids and my hope is that my daughters are learning what it means to live right\nBy watching the right in my life\nBecause I Know I got Seventeen I got Eighteen years left with them not left with them and I got Seventeen Eighteen years until they're out hope I got many years left with them but Seventeen Eighteen years and I know I Know the times going to come when we look in their bedrooms\nWell their bedrooms going to be another home\nI'll never stop being a parent\nAnd I know while they're living at home\nI've got to be present do my part [noise] not living the regret

telling me ... so that they do my own little town you know where to go and then when you press them to find out what what did he do going well I haven't really been paying attention\nYou haven't been paying attention so you don't even know what he's accused of a no vote whatever it is he he's accused of it did it I can tell you that you know why because they got big are they gonna\nThis is where we are today so I'm having this discussion my friend about this I'm going to a serious disease actually said that yes he actually said this\nAnd we're talking about how dangerous is is you know both sides do this to a certain degree both sides circle the wagons around their side I mean that's a natural thing\nBut this is a little bit more serious because you've got a guy who was accused of trying to rape a woman and you're just going to assume because he's not of your party that he's guilty\nI said you should ask 'em back he's Allison because he would have been just as ill informed about that\nAnd then you could have set it up this way he's a good who's Keith Ellison well Keith Ellison is this Republican congressman whose wife said that he was beaten er and er and er he he should he should leave Congress wide guaranteed did it oh I say Republican you know he's a Democrat well\nHe probably didn't [laughter] and that's the way I'm telling you it's the way we have\nRunning concurrently widow capital but this is this is the ironic part of this whole thing that will never that history will never show running concurrently on a parallel track with all of his cabinet stuff was a much more plausible\nMuch more believable accusation and certainly much more recent accusation against a sitting Democrat congressman\nOf nuts ... not you know fooling around maybe going too far of beating her up slapping her around verbally and physically abusing the woman and where did that go in the press know where where do they go in any kind of investigation where we added a law firm\nThey investigated they said they want anything to of course this law for I'm gay five hundred thousand dollars to the Democrats including fifty thousand dollars Alison himself\nBut we're these folks out there where the where the pain can't people on the ... thing they're nowhere to be found and the irony for an irony this going to be in the newspaper column this week I've already written it I mean usually I wait until tomorrow to write about he written it\nSend it out Hillary Clinton\nWhat does the irony of that she's making the rounds last week all over everywhere talking about these women need to be believed\nWell how about all those women who accused Bill Clinton how about wanting to Broderick how that all about Paula Jones having all these folks and then they'll they're bimbos who need to be destroyed\nAnd that's what James Carville came in one of the ... the right wing to came up with is James Carville is the one who called him to bimbo ruptures member rushing out there\nWell why isn't Carville being called on the car carpet by calling a victim who we are supposed to believe a bimbo and also said they were living\nI Can't hear you I Can't hear myself then I'd go also said to they were living in trailer parks there trailer park here drag five dollar bill so excited about\nThis what's come up with\nSome of the people who accused Clinton were memos and trailer trash that you could just drag five dollars to a trailer part in this which come up with I thought we were supposed to believe the survivors now they're all survivors well here's the thing\nYou're supposed to believe who you want to believe but you need to have some credible information there is no pattern of behavior to Brett Kavanaugh I'm not going to rehash do Brett Kavanaugh thing but there is a pattern of behavior for Bill Clinton\nAnd it was before he became what was before you even have the politics for crying out loud but it was certainly before he came to Washington DC and continued afterwards and everybody knew it including all of those folks around them they just knew that in order for him to survive politically you would have to destroy the survivors\nThat's where the column no survivors the survivors of Bill Clinton need to be destroyed and you had George ... who was in the thick of all that with James Carville and Hillary Clinton\n... George Stephanopoulos has now supposedly respected journalists that NBC\nAnd on good morning America and on this week without David Brinkley and the rest of this stuff\nHillary making the rounds as some sort of hang on yoga of the Democratic party a and she's ... years she's supposed to be an expert on everything and then they have all these women need to be believed and not one person interviewing her says\nWell should we believe the people that have lined up to accuse your husband are we supposed\nTo leave them too well here's what I Know the liberals love to say this to take away the take away from this is this if you're a conservative you're guilty if you're a liberal you're not unless you have to be Harvey Weinstein and they just had to sacrifice him because Harvey Weinstein was at the tip of the spear for me too movement\nBut the rest of it all depends on who we're going to believe but most of the accusations and you can look this up for the meat to thing had been liberals it's been the liberals who have you been accused of most thing and certainly the ones that are provable certainly the ones that are provable\nBut that doesn't seem to matter or if the Republicans were just ugly people\nAnd now to just destroying the hate women and so now we have Taylor Swift of all people and she's come out in support of an old white guy\nOver a woman to be in the Senate I thought we were supposed to be lifting women up\nPutting women in positions of power oh that's right if they are Republicans no no no no no we need to to ride them we need to ridiculed then when he did drive them out of politics so you're not for women you're not for minorities it's only liberals at your for this is why I call it the N. double A.\nB. C. it's not the national association a for a colored people if National Association for the advancement of political correctness\nIf there were any other thing than they would have been for Clarence Thomas wouldn't they\nThey would have supported Condi Rice people like this Tim Scott of South Carolina other people of color but they don't they only support liberals of color isn't that interesting\nAnd in their world you're only a survivor if you happen to be a liberal if you're a conservative well you're not a survivor you're part of the problem especially if you're a conservative who has accused the liberal of doing something untoward like sexual assault or rape or whatever you're certainly not to believe\nThis is why this whole thing needs to be re calibrated\nWe need to recalibrate folks here's the deal we go back to the default on the machine you know the default on the machine is\nWe believe you if you have a credible accusation against somebody and it doesn't necessarily mean that you have other witnesses if there is a pattern of behavior\nIn this person whether it be Bob Packwood there was a Republican or Bill Clinton who was a Democrat then your case has more [noise]\nBut if you just come right out of the blue and accuse somebody thirty three years after the fact of something that there's no pattern in this person's life to indicate that he has ever done anything like this before or since\nThen you're gonna have to come with some proof and Dr Ford not only came with no proof the proof she came with was completely discredited\nSo we have now Brett

I Would not be the one to go after Jim Brown that that that's not going\nTo be a lot yeah I can tell I could tell that that I [laughter]\nI\nI and I don't know where we'll after a week man ... ... you know the thing is is that I'm a ... ... even today even still today I Would never be able to catch up with a guy [laughter] but the but the point is\nThat right ... ... ... to\n... the ... and the point on the you know on the bigger picture is the fact that\nJim Brown it has been a very active in his life you know a during incense football and and so you really can't make a point against Jim Brown because he's the guy that walks walk he's the guy that doesn't just talk about it he he'll go and do it\nYou know Kanye West is is the rock star and I know you know Jim Brown's an athlete but since what ball Jim Brown's been much more than an athlete\nAnd so you know again he's the lead people tend to take him seriously they'll they try and be dismissive of ... ... but but the point is is that on that one point the economy I made and and it wasn't necessarily today but\nUh it was a couple of months ago talking about well why can't I just vote for why can't I think this way or why can't I just spoke for the person that I that I vote for even if it's the one that that the other side doesn't vote for you know ... why do I have to be why am I being criticized for\nUh thinking this way and and that's the point again that we have made\nA and pointed out the article written about\nMia Love ah and and and all of that over the years it's been said a time and time again but you know that's the thing and I and thank you for the call west\nI when you when you sit down go ahead and debate a try I I mean on the merits on the content\nA a a ... well Jim Brown um but but a politically\nWell I Want to Lisa rice a Mia Love well but I'll tell you why about Jim Brown because Jim Brown's old mhm yeah Jim Brown as you look at and by the way to the last caller I agree with you I Do believe that John Brown was the\nThe best running back over to play yeah I have to the game of uh of football hadn't hadn't discussion many times yeah uh you know I I got to watch you know OJ play mhm and uh you know as as I've always said OJ was for my boyhood heroes ... I was um and uh I never saw anybody accelerate\nLike O. J. but I don't think I've ever seen anybody have the kind of moves that Barry Sanders had when he played for Detroit but\nHis his career was a a a limited Gail Sayers also was just a a superb running back there's been a ton of good running backs out there I don't think anybody had the power of what what differentiated Jim Brown was\nHe just had the power go back and watch some of the old films of\nJim Brown ... I mean walking over ... over linebackers\nBigger than him mhm and and just having incredibly now idiot power but he had great balance didn't have the speed I don't believe we're the acceleration of an OJ or very Sanders and but he had the power nobody I I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had bought\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average uh a a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is bearing on who you're talking about that though the the the old guy that you know they might remember the fact that you know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with but Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the left is scared to death of Kanye West because he's smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm he cannot\nHave a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion then Trump is exploiting the mental issues\nThe Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues of ... when he when you know he was up the award show where they know on the ... no no no uh nobody in the law was talking about his", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "14"}
