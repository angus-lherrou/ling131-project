marriage is working he hates that you're even listening right now I feel extremely confident that\nWhether you're tuned in tonight or listening via our pod cast as so many of our listeners say they are that they're right now is some distractions fighting right now for your attention I feel company for many of our listeners right now there is a distraction fighting for our attention because the

Liberia and there will always be life issues\nCompeting against your merits\nSo before we take a break at the top of that I Would offer some suggestions to get you\nThinking about time together whether you're a newly wed young married whether you're married with a baby or parents with teens are couples whose kids are now out of the house we gotta we gotta fight for time together let me let me say this quickly to young newlyweds maybe your schedule and Bob the heavy load of school work right now you're filling\nHigher education goals or\nMaybe it's that daily grind of employment you got to put in those hours of work overtime and feel like you've got to kill it ten hours a day to keep the attention of your employer I get that\nMass adjusted for fighting for a time together maybe it's just that you meet for lunch\nMaybe it's even lunch in the car when he dropped the other person's place of work\nMaybe it's that you study together if you're in school right now maybe it's that you ... the moment so sure that you make them work maybe it's at her work or your work or after school listen you you got to work to find that I'm married couples would newborns listen you're probably really really tired right now that downtime more electric for use a quick now\nThings are going to be a little crazy for a while so it could be that\nFighting for time for you guys it's short spurts

time maybe your time together is time with your kid in the room is okay your kid doesn't even know he or she is really in the room because they are and if it right now but as it ... it just it's a new life for you it as it's a little crazy right now just no it's okay that time they'd be short\nBut it can be sweet married couples with teens eight you know it your schedule is probably determined by their schedule your time maybe just short sports as well whatever your season of life and maybe your kids or mood and they're out of the house maybe you've never had kids the important thing is as

Indonesian death toll I'm Evan Handler has demonstrators protested half the Senate voted to seat Brett Kavanaugh on the United States Supreme court\nAnd do we share a bed together she said we're not having sex anymore we don't see each other every day we are still in a union that's very powerful to hear her say this we're still connected\nYou see some of the big part of the connection is our kids\nAnd parents this reminds me divorced mom and dad specifically this reminds me of what I said at the beginning of the show it's very parallel to my first part of the show that it's not about me\nMy my newly re married divorced for him reminded me of deaths that because of our kids we still have this connection\nAt the top of the show I said this that it's not about me we live in this me world were consumed with me messages telling us it's all about me with marriage we have to be mindful particularly when divorce is involved\nYou are more important to me that you and this particular situation often involves the kids and because there are kids involved there are times when even when you're in divorce\nThat you're divorced previous spouse becomes more important to you I Know that's tough to hear that's tough for me to say easier said than done because I'm not divorced I get that I totally get that but I Am confident and I hope every divorced a couple of with kids here's this tonight I Am confident\nThat divorce can still provide for you the opportunity to be an amazing parents in may\nMaybe even better than the parent you were before the divorce [noise] let me explain number one it's all about love we talk about love on the show a lot this might be one of the\nListen this might be we're in the most difficult worst for me to use in such a moment because in a relationship a marriage the love was broken and I and I and I get that\nBut your kids are still in that love story even though mom and dad live in different homes now they're still a love story and then their hearts in their hearts there is a part of their hearts were the two of you will never you'll never be split\nSo your kids are watching the experience there watching how you and mom and dad interact\nSo I just want to remind you this sounds so simplistic and I don't just throw this out there just to have a point to give to\nDivorced parents with kids but I I just want to remind you of the importance of not speaking badly about one another particularly in front of your kids modeling\nModeling good behavior by getting along with your ex it's just really critical to your kids stability if you're allowing the kids to choose who they live with hey don't make 'em feel guilty about that choice keep in mind they are the innocent victims in this situation\nYou know what the number one place to listen to this you know what the number one place is the kids tell me their parents trashed one another\nSocial media divorced kids tell me the number one place my momma my daddy trashed one another ... social media Facebook Snapchat answering ever you kidding me hello parents your kids and their friends and their friends' parents\nThey see this stuff to put yourself in their shoes your was altogether in one home now their homes have been ripped apart their clothes their furniture they're everything is split between two locations\nVacations time off from school holidays will never be the same again with the need so bad the is one of the greatest acts you can show them in this very typical moment is to be a parent that loves even if you're a parent who doesn't like you know sometimes we got to love our ex so much\nAnd I say we even though I don't include myself in that for me because I'm not divorced but sometimes you gotta love your ex so much that you're willing to move past the the reality that you don't like them because of the kids\nSo we got to operate in love secondly you got to be consistent and everything you do in everything you do be dependable be reliable make them laugh their life is full of inconsistencies don't let your name be on the list of things that continually ship in sway and discipline them\nLet that love be consistent\nHere's another one and here's my face shut up through worship together your child regardless of how long ago the divorce occurred needs spiritual consistency\nI Can't think of the more consistent act for every facet of their lives\nIn the act of going to church together as a family don't just drop them off to go with them your ex may never agree your ex may never walk through the doors of a church you don't control your ex choices\nYou can't control what they do you can control what you do when your child is with you and if even\nEven if it's just a few days a month okay make it happened when it can happen worship together prays together pray pray let me say it again pray with your child pray over your child pray for your child pray for your ex\nPray for your ex when your child is listening I Can't overstate this point you know what I find it is really hard to stay angry resentful and bitter at someone when you were praying\nAnd laughing and let me say this understand they are hurting to a close friend told me just this week my girls are still hurting\nMy girls are still hurting and the divorce was seven years ago so be it be empathetic about that grief and about that experience realized the hurt you feel is most likely magnified and they're young impressionable hearts\nUnderstand that her look I get it every divorce situation is different [noise] I Know I'm

patch I have a picture in my office it's one of my favorite pictures I see it every single day and every time I see\nIt takes me back to that moment with Amy and the girls and we went out to Walden farms if you're in the national air you probably know wild and farms there's so many great pumpkin patch is\nWe we love the pumpkin patches and if you don't have a plan I Hope you'll think about making it happen\nIn the month of October my daughter's sixteen\nAnd fourteen and they still expect us to carve out no pun intended time to get to\nA pumpkin patch if you are in the national area you can go lifted up you can go to Nashville parent dot com and there's an interactive map of all the farms throughout middle middle Tennessee I'm In a post that link on my Facebook page and we take a break here\nBut if you're the Nashville area go to Nashville parent dot com and there's an interactive map there and it tells you everything you need to know about where the farms are what they offer hours of operation the cost I find that my girls again even at their agents they love these moments with mom and dad when we're altogether\nDoing something different and here's the key word to gather\nThis is what we call it good times moments let me remind you bees listen up these are the memory making years for your kids\nThese are the memory making years for your kids as we're talking about making marriage matter these are the moments that matter the most with your spouse\nI'm sure if if you are dating someone specifically if you are engaged absolutely Ira I remember those those moments you know we were engaged a little over a year and that was some fun exciting time and just the preparation for marriage and all that\nGoes along with that you can just be quiet intoxicated and romantic as you're getting\nKnow one another and planted about life together maybe you've just started dating someone those fun\nTimes can be a little challenging and a mix of emotions when she kinda lock in and you know that I'm with someone and I believe this is someone those are just such good times but let me also remind you is your critical times too because\nSpecifically in these times you have to be so protective\nOf your purity of making smart choices because as I tell young students young about to be marriage all over the country all the time it only takes one poor choice to change everything\nAs I mentioned often on the show up you've mentioned tonight aiming I met in college were both very driven if you know my wife you know how super driven she is when we started dating\nShe was focused on school and graduated in at the top of our class which she did twice going to law school graduate of the top of her class where she did beginning her career as an attorney which she did and still is\nIn his now also a professor at Belmont University who are on the modern and you know as her dad often reminds me I'm married up I keep thinking one night is going to call in and remind me and remind all of our listeners that are married up you know I got to tell you guys have like any person with you while we were dating Amy and I knew\nThat one poor choice could get a new way of a lifetime of dreams and goals for her\nFor me and absolutely it wasn't always easy but I'm so proud to be able to say that the entire time we dated and we walked out through engagement we chose to say no to the physical stuff I'm so proud that we made that choice if you aren't married\nOr have been married and presently aren't let me remind you that you will never let me say that word again you will never regrets honoring God's will for your life in your future spouse's life by avoiding all of that stuff\nUntil you get married one mama told me that she told her engaged daughter your motto should be baby until you get the ... you don't get the thing [laughter]\nI really like that I should put that on teacher we saw a lot of teachers that are vis a day you get the ring you don't get the thing that really good couples all across America all of the time making marriage matter begins long listen to this begins long before you say I Do\nAnd you know if you've already crossed that line is never too late to step back from that\nI guarantee you this you will never regret making the safest and healthiest choice\nFor you for your loved one for the help to both of you and this me to era\nThere are countless stories of men who have done horrific things to girls and they're also stories of girls who have made a poor choice with guys\nBut men are sadly leading the charge here\nOf poor choices when it comes to girls it takes a special man every single woman listen to the ... it takes a special man who's willing to look you in the eye and say because I Want the very best for you for me for our future I Want us to say no\nTo any choice any choice\nThat could bring about a consequence an emotional regrets\nOr an unplanned situation that could steer us off course so we got a hold each other accountable listen it is so important particularly for those of you yet to be married you're thinking about marriage we got I got a whole bunch of other cattle that's so important you got a whole\nThis is a fire for what's best and ripe for both of you I Love the roost in twenty board says let us consider how we spoke to one another on towards love\nIn good deed is this an old way of living maybe an old school way of living maybe but listen just because something's consider the past doesn't mean it's not the best for your future\nJeffrey fuel for example why they matter\nMarriage and I really could really entire fall talking about marriage [noise]\nWill because I began to she'll tell me why matters marriage to matter to you [noise] because marriage matters to God\nHe began the hotel theloop with marriage he made Adam\nHe made an IV\nAnd he said this genesis to twenty four says this is why men will leave his father\nAnd he will leave his mother and he will be joined to his wife and the two will be nominated into what have you worked from\nGod making marriage matters something we should do because it matters to God he ordained the first couple Adam and Eve men and women to be married and he ended that chapter in the Bible that chronicles the story\nOf they're beginning at the beginning of humanity on planet earth it is chapter two in the book of genesis\nHe'd be he began their story and then at the end of this chapter he ended up by saying the man and his wife felt no shame\nWe're listening we're living in times when there is a we just living in times when there are so many couples who are just living in shape because of poor choices\nSince it matters to God it needs to matter to us and that's why we bring you the truth even the hard truth every week because marriage isn't as simple as choosing coke or Pepsi\nIt is a lifetime choice that matters to God and so here's another point real quickly for ... for couples for marriage for divorced really for everyone pray for those listen pray for those in with those you love\nPray for those and with those you love you pray for those closest to you you pray for your spouse\nIf not what should you pray for anything you want to\nPray for anything that comes to mind here a few suggestions prefer wisdom protection streets courage to serving character charisma knowledge favor in the workplace financial success health friendships\nSafety when driving joy faith in on and on and on the Bible says pray with out ceasing\nMy prayer for you is that you continue to make marriage matter because it sure is worth it it doesn't mean you're perfect\nBut it means every day you realize the blessing and the responsibility comes would do in life with someone who is committed their life do you making marriage matter in your own marriage will be I Am confident\nA choice you never regret it will be a choice you never regret\nIt tonight guys thanks for joining the conversation now\nThe real conversation begins in your home\nFrom a challenge to us keep talking remember strong families can overcome\nAny thing to gather to go\nThere will be the parent you are made to be the spouse you were made to be your wife or your husband your family they're counting on you and remember the key to remain in family strong prayer [noise] the family the prays together\nI Believe the family to stay

spoke in ... Kansas to celebrate Kavanaugh's confirmation and blast those who oppose his nomination each of you\nWill have a chance to just four weeks surrender your verdict on the Democrats conduct at the ballot box [noise]\nSenate\nMinority leader Chuck Schumer who fought Kavanaugh's confirmation hammered the same message before the fifty to forty eight vote the put capital on the court\nOh but there's a Supreme Court nominee coming up I think it's him middle name was given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nDr Ford's husband claims to recall but she had done it by judge Kavanaugh by name in twenty twelve at that point judge Kavanaugh his name was widely reported in the press is a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election\nIn any event it to a doctor for over Thirty years to name her statement believe disclosure of abuses come and so this is not the positive this positive when speaking number three when speaking with her husband she changed her description of the incentive to become less\nSpecific she testified that she told her husband about a a sexual assaults\nTold her husband a sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post she informed her husband that she was the victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified that both time she was referring to the same incident number four she has no memory of key details were not in question details that could help\nCorroborate her account I was watching a video\nAnd it was some woman screaming at somebody and you know they're all out there protesting and screaming and everybody says we have cooperation her memory now some of you have sent me a video of this woman and I watched it over the weekend but I Can't remember the name right off and\nShe was given a Ted Talk she's done extensive research into fake memories\nNow you remember when this thing first came out about Dr Ford and I said one positive member I told you about some of these fathers who actually went to jail because they went through this um reconstructive memory therapy\nAnd their daughters came out the other side and said yes he sexually abused me and then they send the guy off to jail and me to find later that the daughters we can say that really didn't happen that was suggested to me by a therapist\nThis is a real problem\nAnd this particular scientist who's been studying this now for I don't know how long decades she's written numerous papers on this she says the very real thing the power of suggestion\nThey did experiments with people and uh the little things like telling them that they were attacked by a wild animal\nAnd like forty percent of them then when you ask them would give you a vivid description of being attacked by a wild animal even though they never were\nIs one of those things where we are talking about a memory how many of you folks can remember back thirty six years ago or whenever it was now I can remember is a lot of things from thirty six years ago but I Would not trust my memory\nNow I Know you're in a role that tape if I ever have to go to court and [laughter] I'm just telling you thirty six years ago is a long time ... you don't understand this is a traumatic experience well yeah if it's a traumatic experience\nI've told you about some of my minor traumas of getting in trouble as a youth and I remember where I was when I got in trouble but I remember the details I remember where it was I remember who was with me\nAnd I can tell you if I were to call these guys right now they would oh yeah I mean I remember that oh yeah boy am\nShe has none of that she can't tell you where she was she can't tell you exactly what it was now I don't fault her for that because some of these things that I've done or gotten in trouble for I couldn't tell you exactly when it was\nI can give you a ballpark of when it was high school or certainly after I became sixteen so that narrows it down to about a year and a half in high school because I was young for my grade\nBut I can certainly tell you where it was take exactly where I was in who was with me and they can corroborate the stories she can do none of that\nNumber five Dr forwards account of the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she identified as having attended including her lifelong friend and I'm yeah I'm I'm On this team here today\nBecause I think it's important I went back and watch some of the testimony that I missed when I was driving in because they came back from different breaks and I was getting bad linked to the radio station in between so that I could watch the rest of it but I miss some of it\nAnd I miss this I missed\nFord Dr Ford and talking about this ... or a woman\nAnd her recollection of it and she actually was texting back and forth with this woman days before\nNow that sounds like witness tampering to me can you imagine if judge Kavanaugh said well I was texting back and forth with mark judge you were texting with mark judge what are you trying to get your story straight\nAll they would never let it go has anybody even question that this woman was texting one of the principals involved that's giving a statement as to whether it happened and why was she texting her\nWhile I Would subpoena those text messages to find out what they were saying I don't know what they said apparently it didn't do anything to sway the ultimate outcome of the testimony because the woman the legal in Kaiser woman says I don't remember it but I Believe you so I don't remember but I Believe you know\nYou can say well that's okay but then she says I don't remember ever even meeting Brett Kavanaugh\nSo none of this is adding up\nNumber six Dr Ford has not offered it consistent account of the alleged assault\nAccording to her a letter to Dianne Feinstein she heard judge Kavanaugh I'm Mark judge talking to each other to other party Gore's downstairs while she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she couldn't hear them talking to anyone\nIn her letter she says I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other person's at the house we're talking\nWith them\nThan cabin on mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that people downstairs couldn't hear the screens and I explained this to you you would probably hear the screens over a stereo in the same room you may not here to the stereo was on wide open downstairs but you would certainly hear it over a stereo in the room\nOf getting into the tractor analogy you ever been around somebody that's on a tractor and somebody walks up to him you can hear everything they're saying because he's screaming over the over the loud tractor\nAnd you did you jog down there\nBut if the tractor were next to you you wouldn't be able to hear anything they were saying so if the loud music was where she was her screens would be heard over the music and I would assume people would come running\nShe said there was no music on nothing there was silence downstairs find it hard to believe\nAccording to the Washington Post accounted for therapy notes there were four boys in the bedroom\nWhen she was assaulted she told the Washington Post the notes were erroneous because there were four boys and the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter to Feinstein she says me and for others were present at the party and her testimony she said that there were four boys ... Kaiser and herself\nShe couldn't remember the name of the fourth boy and nobody's come forward or they wouldn't be coming forward because it didn't happen apparently\nAnd then she listed Patrick PJ Smith as a bystander enter statement and the polygraph test and then the July sixth text of the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate they called him a bystander\nShe didn't list Leland Kaiser even though they're good friends ... is president should have been more memorable than PJ Smith\nAnd then number seven\nDr Ford struggled to recall important in recent events relating to her allegations and their testimony regarding recent events rains is further questions about our memory\nShe struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post she couldn't remember if she showed a fool or partial set of therapy notes the Washington Post reporter she doesn't remember whether she showed the post reported the therapists notes her own summary of the notes\nNow these are you saying well this is mine is no if I've got notes from the therapist and I'd say well this ... these are the notes I Would know if I gave it to a reporter or whether I'd just summarize them for the reporter I Would know that\nBut she doesn't know that\nShe said in her first what's app message to the post that she had therapy notes talking about the incident when she contacted the post tip line she testified that she had reviewed or therapy notes before contacting the posed\nTo determine whether the mention whether they mention anything about the alleged incident but she couldn't remember if she had a copy of those notes as she said in her what's at message or Miller reviewed the amateur therapist office and again I relate back to one of the earlier\nPoints that Sarah Carter's making and that is she never mentioned Kavanaugh to her therapist either in the group therapy or one on one\nThere's nothing about Kavanaugh and the therapist notes although we had been led to believe she named him in twenty twelve well now that's just here say from her husband\nNumber eight\nForests description of the psychological impact of the events raises questions\n[noise]\nSo you see on good manners are very very\nImportant some day many years from now when you're a grown up you'll be a man\nAnd when you are you should be a gentleman do you want me

radio network\nOh buddy Kevin Jackson [noise]\nFox News distributor has been fired [noise]\nWe've had him on many times especially where we do this whole defeat the fire thing I see and they are the Republican conventions and things like there's a fireball\nSo what do you get fired for well he says I'm he tweeted this one was when they tweak this I think is over the weekend he says feminist or their own worst enemies than any of women\nAlso they want men to never be believe I'm not succumbing to hell with the notion that women must be believe no matter what lying gangs is what these three women are and we all know more\nFollower limited his firing from Fox News saying Kevin I agree with you I'm Sorry about the way it turned out with Fox sometimes we have to take a hit on our way up the steps after he was\nFired he burnt some bridges on the way out he was on Joe ... radio show this morning dragged to add Henry and Jesse waters through the mud on his way out\nAccording to mediate Jackson somehow defended Bill Cosby blaming his jail time on some left the feminist crap and then went after Henry in waters says an ad Henry was hanging out with strippers while he was married\nWhich is a absolutely true I'm Edie Henry left the White House beat in twenty six team after news became public that he'd had an affair with a Las Vegas strip her\nAfter about four months of self reflective time all corners of the Daily Caller he returned to the network in another role Jackson didn't pass them the chance to take a dig a Jesse water is either who's getting a divorce after allegedly being

you like a heaping helping of sarcasm and humor from a guy who learn to speak live third as a child and this show is for you\nSo maybe we can get him on I was I thought I had his number in my phone but I apparently don't\nHad it sucked away from my fault [laughter]\nI don't know but I Would love to hear his side of the story on this thing too I mean you know make all these women who were going after Kavanaugh's gangs and Fox fire them forward um is it over the line you'll be the judge you\nThere's a lot of other stuff to talk about though Rachel Mitchell you remember her she's the Maricopa County prosecutor that specialized in sex crimes\nWell she sent a memo to the Senate Republicans and check this out five pages obtained by the Washington Post\nCites a number of inconsistencies and Dr Ford this testimony on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary committee and explaining why the allegation would not be sufficient to bring criminal charges absent corroborating evidence\nBecause I can tell you right now if judge Kavanaugh who he said when he was on a on the hot seat in the Senate Judiciary committee last week he says I haven't talked to ... to a a mark judge in years and he says you know we\nWere good friends in college and then he went his way and I went my way and we've seen each other different things and communicated off and on but I haven't talked to them in years\nWhat if Brett Kavanaugh was vigorously texting back and forth with Martin judge a key witness in this whole proceeding\nPeople would be all they'd be screaming that would be enough to get him off the confirmation that would be enough to disqualify him in the eyes of all these liberals out there but yet we have Dr Ford who was by our own admission under oath in testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee\nWas texting back and forth with ... or over the last few days a key witness\nWho could either corroborate or not her story why would you be texting back and forth with her well she takes me first\nAnd I would just ignore the tax if I'm sitting there is somebody who is a key witness or not a key witness and accused her of somebody and a key witness contacts me\nI Would tell the Senate Judiciary committee immediately that this woman contacted me and I did not contact her back\nAnd then show them the text message of what she may have said in the text message but they're going back and forth and ... I Believe you I Believe you but I Can't remember any of this [laughter]\nI Can't remember going to a party like this I don't know that I ever met Brett Kavanaugh do we need to see those\nText messages will the FBI investigate those text messages\nThat is something that I'm worried about that they won't do and if you're the president of the United states and you have the ability to sort of guide this investigation\nI'd call up Chris Wray over there and say Chris you know I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job but this woman under oath said she was talking with one of the witnesses days prior testimony don't we need to know what they were talking about\nSeeing as they were set in their story straight\nOr if Dr Ford was urging her to tell it her way do we need to know this\nI think is highly unusual you folks who were in the law business will notice when you've got an accuser and a witness and the witness is getting ready to take the witness stand and the accuser and the witnesses have been communicating back and forth prior to her testimony that's problematic to say the least\nNot to mention all the inconsistencies and Dr Ford story which I Hope the FBI is gonna investigate that when did she have the renovations done she said she did this because of the cabinet nightmares in twenty twelve the Palo Alto records show they did the renovation and two thousand\nEight four years before that we also know that there's no mention of Kavanaugh inner therapists notes plane\nIf this had been holding her if she had been if she'd been suffering from P. T. S. D. is she said then why didn't she tell her therapist who the culprit was\nRarely have her husband's testimony Oh yes she told me well I I don't think that that's a valid piece of ... and even if she did tell him again her telling the story over and over again is not corroboration in of itself but\nWe'll see I just think it's going to turn out really good for Kavanaugh by the end of the week my wife thinks he's going to that they're going to drop him I think they're going to confirm him will see one eight hundred six one eight Phil we're back into [noise]\n\nI can still make an impression on land can bring your bank account because when I Do need to get ... job placement change people right in my community ... years donation Saturn ... rocket will and that has a\n[noise] this this morning we are only two million women who have joined in the war effort now make up thirty seven percent of the workforce changing their procedures medical school\nOpening a new\nThree little girls all over the world looks at the sky where the first woman is now in space\nMilitary stereotypes of challenge today with the trailblazing promotion of us female officer to four star general [noise]\nIt was just announced that the vast majority of last year's doctor degrees were earned by women\nWe've come so far but our news is changing for the worse more women die from heart disease and stroke and many even though it can be prevented make a change I Do read for women dot org today ... by the ad council and the American hardest hit\nFor baseball cap mess and everything you need to think about what you really can't do much more\nFedEx delivery game day their\nReturn that her by delivering\nNinety nine seven WPN\n\nVietnam we have a\nThis is priceless well this is about Richard Blumenthal this is what Trump had to say about them to them\nLook at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no for Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang province we call them ...

because he doesn't drink\nThis is turning into a circus folks an absolute circus in the meantime we got Chuck Grassley calling for the investigation of wannabe Kavanaugh accuses Jeffrey cattle

recanted his story singing made it all up\nMade it all up well Chuck Grassley requested a criminal investigation and Mr catlin for making false accusations and the investigation they also include Senator Sheldon Whitehouse for assisting in promoting a false accusation the plot thickens doesn't it and do things\nThat they're not going to be more accusations we got that professor from North

you believe the accuser we all know it\nRight\nWell otherwise you consider Bill Clinton a criminal or a number of times over right\nNow can I ask another question\nYou know I just mentioned Amy Schumer because of you know people know who she is but the ... model thing why descent you buddy give her eye on the right ability I I Know this probably maybe we mentioned her just once or twice as being\nJoking but why does anybody give her any type of credibility whatsoever I've always well then again if you're talking about the left I say you should give somebody credibility by the substance of their argument would that's the case you'd never hear from anybody on the left so I I forget about what I just said there well\nI don't know why she's relevant is she in the current show I don't know I actually don't know I don't know why she's relevant otherwise\nI saw what those who's the boss to runs all the time\nI'm just [laughter] and she was in the the one with the er which is\nYeah yeah yeah and so she was a witch right yeah yeah\nYeah so\nI don't know I I have no idea if she's in a TV show right now or not but I don't\nKnow I think she was in something last year I don't I really I mean she\nShe's relevant to the situation because she claims you know that she was sexually assaulted so\nI don't know that I'll get it I mean I Know I Know that she had in part of him yeah she'll probably I I Do okay yeah right yeah I didn't know that she said she was\n... that's what I didn't know okay that makes that would that would be a connection that you can use to gain you know right of incidents like that because that's what it's about right okay\nBut I I but pop culture wise I don't know she still is or not I actually don't well as I said you know we because we hear people coming forward\nYou know the you know saying look I've also been I was sexually assaulted two ... and I stand with her well as we said before whether you were sexually assaulted or not still does not give you any more credibility\nWhen a charge is filed or you know when the charges filed against someone I don't mean legally but in this case a ... in um in his nomination to the Supreme Court\nBut the allegation itself has to be backed up by evidence your case for no matter how a missed an evil it might have been if you are sexually assaulted has nothing to do\nWith this case right absolutely nothing because you were sexually assaulted does not give you a better insight as to whether Kavanaugh is guilty or not right none zero right and that is portrayed\nYou know it's one of the one falls that's portrayed well then you well okay then you were late here in ...\n... because you are sexually assaulted then or what you think about cabinet carries more weight no it doesn't that's ridiculous right it's ridiculous statement to make or to be promoting it has promoted constantly in this the only thing that matters is the evidence and every Seattle case in you and I talked about this\nHow long have we talked about this when you know whether it was Trayvon Martin where people were taking sides left and right and we just said look here's the problem you've got that was at the two or three or four minutes span there mhm where he was running away and then next thing you know uh he was on top of government that's the only thing that people saw at that point\nAnd because of that huge blank space in there that no witnesses are there nobody can say what happened so\nThat way by the physical evidence which whereas the life the uh the the injuries to Zimmerman's head but exactly we've said and even a juror or a jury member said\nIt's possible that he got away with murder it's just that with the evidence we couldn't prove because he claims that you know he felt is his life was an imminent danger\nAnd and we rejected at that point and the people uh who would call this show\nAnd with certainty say they knew the guilt or innocence site and we had people bring it up yeah the Trayvon Martin was an angel doesn't matter whether he\nWas or was not an angel right or any other time of his life it doesn't matter what their men headset at any time in his life right all the matter is he said I'm\nGoing to you know let's say a word I write Trayvon Martin right with that and that would have been obviously right would have been which are more said in\nSay ... but people were definitive in their belief of guilt or innocence and based on a lack of evidence and what they think possibly happen we have rejected that we will always reject that as Americans\nAs far as I'm concerned you're obligated to reject that type of yes mindset absolutely go by the evidence the evidence is what dictates everything\nThe motion is what carries the ah the the cause and in in such protests and and certainly for the families who suffer are the the loss of a loved one whether it's a Trayvon Martin's family or or Michael Brown family you can feel\nFor their loss but also know this this this is possible but many people find it impossible to feel for the last of the family but also believe and see by the evidence see what the evidence shows\nThat the evidence points to that person also being responsible now it didn't necessarily in in the in the Trayvon Martin case you had you know what the physical evidence was was ... and then that's what the jury found and we we don't have\nWe don't have a everything the jury saw no no yeah but in the Michael Brown situation with officer ... Wilson on the same um you know the the family or was the first to commissioned an autopsy\nThen that autopsies the one that show the hands up don't shoot never heritage was alive it's still being used today yes as a rallying cry that never happened\nOr that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talk about the Democrats are always talking about\nThe fascist on the right well if you listen to what we believe mhm and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or just the public opinion in general or a political trial\nStill it's the same thing you judge these cases you judge cases and you'd and and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation alone\nAnd and the thing is I'm saying this with passion\nBut I really don't have to because every single Democrat listening right now every single liberal and democratic protesting yesterday and they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard mhm you know how they know it because we're the first ones\nMany of those who are in a you know who ah were arrested yesterday a will would demand due process under you know due process under the law but the fact is they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leads the mindset of fascism leads in them when it's what they want when it comes to how they're going to be treated no you must follow the constitution completely but treating somebody else a constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset\nOf the presumption of innocence and that evidence is the only thing that leads and should lead is thrown out the window because we want what we want\nYou know what comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison\nAnd got out and twenty six team they wanted to be fully exonerated was working to that end and finally it happened it was full exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years where he was either behind bars are having as you know his name essentially associated with\nA murder that happened that he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and refresh my memory on other cases and there was a man who was accused of rape\nAnd spent decades behind bars um it

letter\nA Chuck Grassley Sunday a letter to the lawyers of a doctor for did said I'm a I'm writing in response to your letter dated October second you said Dr Ford is was yesterday said you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not for the documents to be turned over to the FBI actually to provide the documents the Senate Judiciary committee response on behalf of the client is a non ... what are the constitution charges the Senate with the ... and the president and his nomination\nSenators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything be FBI does that's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us\nOr the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of how the FBI conduct its investigations take it up with director rate\nBut don't raise that objects and there's a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence the FBI's investigative decisions art art concern even at the FBI never interviewed Dr Ford or interviews or ten times this committee as a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr Ford's allegations\nAnd that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations\nIt's not even clear to me what purpose tornado do over those materials to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that off but in sober\nTo watch it as we just said that's got was we stop that's the only purpose the FBI search that's always an upset is probably stop the last caller she was well there there there are political ... with the investigation decide political ... the ... the\nThe FBI only facilitates the interviews they conduct the abuse because they have the resources and the training and that's it's that simple right and and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant to the investigation to begin with because\nFor the million time there is no FBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on is the Senate Judiciary investigation\nWell because it it just shows you how are the the lawyers for Dr Ford or either\nCompletely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out because have they been given to the FBI\nAgain assume the FBI decided to respond to them and take those notes those therapists notes they would have been part of the report they wouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\n[noise] uh it's not even and by the way emerges from my phone because I just happened to go into it or in the Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate\nAnd that is precisely the outcome that I think what this request is to get the information right you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I've requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nShe even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go to a to a a national media indeed if the evidence or supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so\nYou are preventing the Senate from consider any evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence\nDoes not support Dr Ford's allegation in quite the way you will claimed ooh that's a challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the ah with the Washington Post that Dr Ford\nHas relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key to\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein in her own oh\nOther than a year communications with me and my staff member my step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing\nThe alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Tice or mark judge and Patrick Smith and a WBUR mirrors Julie sweating Nick or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday ... so it was like I said the last caller brought up was\nShe was going to turn them over to the FBI and our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point does it go directly to the Senate to begin with yeah there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to
