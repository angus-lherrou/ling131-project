this decent man they're ready for the next appointment and what they're doing right now and I can tell you right now because you don't have to be a genius or to believe me gets true they are doing

been right most of the times and I think I'm going to be right right now he will be much more conservative right now but I Want to go back to the social issue of bums they're for catering and urinating in the streets of the big cities\nBecause I don't know how long it's going to be till I go back to the city again\nUh I have an apartment in the city and I go back and forth sometimes I don't know that I Want to be in the streets again\nAnd I wonder how good the food is in these restaurants when you look out of a window and you see a man doing a thing like this I'm asking is that does that appetizing\nIs that what you I I don't understand how city can tolerate this\nSo I said to the Mexican bus boy when this happened I got discussion that I walked it back to a restaurant I send them would this happen in Mexico he looked at me said very quietly noticed wouldn't happen I cannot tell you on this radio show what that bus boy told me they would do to a bum anyone who would deprecating the streets in front of a ... a woman in a child in Mexico but he told me what they would do to him I\nCan't mention it to you but you can pretty much figure out what the Mexican people would do for this kind of behavior now I Want you to understand this is supposed to be superior to Mexico\nAmerica's supposed to be a first world nation was supposed to laugh at Mexico they wouldn't tolerate it what would happen to somebody did that in China\nWhat would happen to somebody did that in Iran what would happen to somebody did that in Beirut, Lebanon\nWe are no longer a first world

failure\nSo now we have the issue of type is breaking out in LA and then we'll get a look at play very ... very shortly plagues still exists Mubarak plague still occurs in the United states of America\nAnd while it was once introduced into the United states\nUh in Nineteen hundred play came in here by rat infested steam ships that itself from affected areas mainly from Asia epidemic soon

entrenched in many areas of the west the United states well but it hasn't been seen in the long in a long time already over eighty percent of us play cases have been the robotic form\nAnd we've only seen about seven human play cases a year in the last few decades but mark my words when the armies of homeless people in the streets\nAnd the rats and the lack of public health care we're gonna see

who said he will back Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S Supreme Court he\nDid so almost immediately after Republican Susan Collins delivered a lengthy speech on the Senate floor where she said she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh Collins announcement gave the nominee enough votes for confirmation and gave senator Manchin a certain degree of comfort that he would not be the one who looked calf the deciding vote\nBecause this individual one of thousands there to stand up for a different point of view how's that for tolerance how does that work in a society\n[noise] so I don't have an answer for society that's become so warped I Would like to say to you that it's unfair and all but you know that already and you probably learned in college that you have to keep your a political views to yourself right\nOh yeah oh yeah I Would write papers differently than how I felt just set piece I teach her aside to get a good girl\nThat's like living in a in communist China that's what they brought these good liberals where'd you go to school\nAt UCLA\nOr don't laugh at the it was still a pretty good school in some departments how long have you lived in in the San Francisco area\nI I grew up here how twenty eight years old and just find a way for for ... years younger but I came back\nSo when you came back have you noticed that deterioration or in the streets\nI worked in that same counselor for the last\nSix five six years\nOn and the homeless between is a couple of blocks I have to walk as a hundred percent where\nAre they aggressive towards you as a young woman\n... pregnant last year I had a homeless than in the approach me and say something that we're not very high and it was it's terrifying\nAnd of course the police even if they're there look the other way\nYeah there are ...\nI don't have an immediate answer a few other than in other countries that's why\nOthers go to work with sisters and why uncles and fathers used to walk women to work I Know it sounds crazy or they have to work too but it turns out that we're reaching that point again where every woman's going to need a male escort to go down the street if this keeps up\nUh there's no other answer for this because the the breakdown of our society is such that the police who are there to protect\nWomen and men cannot do their jobs if a cop what to intervene before that man hurt you even if you're pregnant the cop would lose his job because you see he would have to first punch you in the stomach it you lose a baby for the city to do with knowledge that he was aggressive\nAnd then he hurt you first you see that's how twisted they have made the law which by the way it goes to what happened today with the Supreme Court which hopefully will be confirmed tomorrow we're not going to see much more of this\nWhen this court finally convenes and we finally got one more vote on our side my guess is that this kind of stuff is going to start the change in the country in rather rapidly but that doesn't answer your question\nAh what advice do I have I have no advice I can heal it a ... a a disease city\nI can hail a disease city when you have a a Feinstein a and a pillow see up there on the hill casting aspersions on anyone who who wants to tell the truth to straighten things out you have to keep your own council you have to not express yourself it must be murder for you at work\nAnd at fault\nIf I send you my book which I'm going to do stop mass hysteria you're not going to take that to work you probably have people attack you\nYeah I Would say that I Would say that\nWhile you're getting it you can read it in the privacy of your own home because you live in such a tolerant society that you can't even show a book that you want to read\nThey probably think the book was written by Adolf Hitler but it wasn't it was written by Michael Savage and it's a beautiful book it's a fair minded book and I believe you're going to learn a lot about history and where we are historically and what needs to be done to save this country from the down slide that it is currently a experiencing\nOkay anyone have lots of other guys who want to comment on this right now there's ... it's a cataclysm what just happened to the left have you seen the ... faces have you seen the placards drop to the ground have you seen the pictures of them and capital has the votes\nHave you seen the faces of all of the disappointed hysterics out there have you seen them almost drop to the ground with in these when we\nHave you seen all the crazy girls with the cats break into hysteria and tears when this happened oh you'll see the tonight on the news\nYeah you'll see it you'll see it all over the country they are going to pull the same kind of thing that they've done on colleges thinking that they're going to change the nation by pulling one of the hysteria fits it's not going to work when you see even an old guy like whatever his name was I keep forgetting I mean the guy Grassley\nHe did a great job and I mean the light of what he you know his his age and he's a nice guy from the mid west what they try to do them even have dug in even he got his is higher up they really drove a lot of people for the other side\nI Believe that what Feinstein and company have done to the hope for the whole world to see\nHas made people who are rather moderate Republicans harden their positions and I believe and I hope that this will be reflected during the mid term election I don't know we don't know what's gonna happen we see a polls running one way and then the other\nMadness is a social worker on K XFO magnets which city are you actually in\nUm actually my mother was a social worker in Los Angeles county and ... told me that a homeless people falling three categories a mental illness drug addiction and in a catastrophic event in their lives I stand accident all of them of their employees\nTo wind up in the street okay so what was your mother what was I I'm a former social worker what would your mother advised we do with the armies of the season the arranged people running around our cities\nFor dealing with ah that that is part of the homeless people should carry a spray bottle of alcohol with her because she was a ... and interact with their ... ...\n... here's the one in particular that she really had a hard time dealing with was with the people with their dogs their pets\nAnd that you mentioned that there have been sprayed around here in the freezer the animal so\nNow you're are you talking about the the so called homeless with the attack dogs\nYeah we'll get shafted ...\nWell they're they're basically drug dealers you can see that from a mile away the ones I Know the ... yeah they're all over the place they're violent criminals most of them and they belong in jail not in the streets you know and that that that's another problem is your mother no longer with us\nAs a as a way that I was in three for ...\nAlso already I'm Sorry to hear it but she told you even then what was going on in Los Angeles with the homeless\nWhat's amazing about this average is that some of the things you have ... told me years ago about the ... come in from a phase or for\nI guarantee you if you're poor mother was alive today she couldn't even get a job in the social services any more they would call a too extreme because you're saying like it is through it and let me send you a copy of stop mass hysteria because I Want to stop the mass hysteria before the Gulf so all of us was that simple\nCabinet has votes to be confirmed if the college to the fore speech Collins is a new hero everyone loves are they I think Trump should meant the coin and her image\nIt would uh I don't know what the the nomination would be but I think a new country meant that in the image of Susan Collins a I guess I could tell some jokes about it but I Can't think of one right [laughter]\nRight now but she's the new hero of a lot of Republican women they love her this woman is just wonderful um let's see we got cable are in a David on line nine ... welcome to the program which city are you in right now\nIt's All right right and I always remember that so what's on your mind today\nWell I just wonder I haven't heard talked about Saturday in a while and you know you're getting up for a fight this farming\nWell he's sitting right next to me here as I broadcast\nHe's Fifteen Years old he is a senior citizen\nAnd like all senior citizens he has his issues he has his good days and there's bad days he has a cancer survivor\nYou wouldn't know it because he doesn't show it does to complain about it doesn't cry\nHe had surgery about a year ago and he's a spry in some ways I'm about to be honest the as some coughing fit sometimes at a very worrisome because his vows to leaking or you know around his heart and the fluid builds up and I have to hold them and talk to him and calm them down and then it seems to go away\nAnd um I I sometimes give him a little medication I keep 'em on high doses of pet co enzyme Q. which has turned them around for the better as first turning black again people can't believe it\nThat he looks like he did black hair and originally instead of gray and the Tokyo has been a miracle for him but other than that and you know he's going you know he's aging let's put it to you that way\nAnd I have to give him an awful lot of care as we would anyone any relative of ours who who we love who's lived with us for so many years who gets older and a little in the world we have to take care of them it's that simple I Hope it doesn't reach a point where I Can't take care of him anymore right now thank God it hasn't come to that point but inevitably\nThings do occur it's not the first dog I've had so I Hope that answers the question to some extent\nBecause the teddy is the mascot of the Savage Nation love by millions of people\nAnd years ago I was lucky enough when he was still very healthy\nTo have had one of the great a pet photographers come out from New York Vince remaining when my publisher published catty and me I had asked her to publish a book about the dog and I and she did it as a favorite of me for all the bestsellers that I had just as she did with God faith and reason that I have a great book about teddy\nCalled Patti and me and uh it's it's out there it's floating around the pictures are awesome that's when he was at its peak of health still you know even a few years people go downhill it happens to all of us you know today you're healthy and tomorrow or you're a different person\nSo this is why we love our animals because we see ourselves in them and we hope\nThat comet comes back to us with regard to how we treat our pets is how we get treated by society but
