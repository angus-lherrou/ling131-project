not honoring the namesake of that city Columbus because of the cycles of took over that city\nCatering to the mobs catering to the ethnic bombs in Columbus ohio with the big lie about Christopher Columbus and I gave you a true history of Christopher Columbus including the context of the world which he lived at the time and wouldn't tell them to make that great discovery\nOf America\nAnd without him you wouldn't be sitting here right now God Knows it would have found this country and what it would be today\nThe point is is that the history of Columbus is so important for you to know and as concisely contained in two pages and stop mass hysteria if for no other reason that's worth reading that book that's all I can tell you but that's one of hundreds of different\nFacts that you will find that you need and I don't want to oversell the book I Want to go into the uh subject of a of the day okay so let's take a quick call\nBefore we break on so many different topics\n[noise] a lot of your calling on the sperm counts I Want to see about that one I there was a report that males sperm counts are so severely down in western nations that they're afraid that the entire west could collapse entirely\nWhat do you think is the reason for the collapse of the mail from count I don't think you understand what that really means in terms of the fact that it's not like you're ... looking guy some of the toughest looking\nGuys with the Arabs and the biceps and the ... and the Mets and the glue punishments are impotent basically because ... and not only important but they actually have a very low sperm clap count is too low to actually bear a child is you know that why what is doing it WABC Shawnee line one what's driving the sperm count down\nHow high the crime that\nYes happy Columbus Day may as a memory be forever false\nHair fibers from all over the line that rather than family they're right away for five five in traffic I Hope and pray for fighting for like five frankly [noise]\nOkay so you're blaming women who are aggressive for the lowest sperm right I don't know how that would work that would have to be a psychological reaction\nFinding her hair and if I sell\nMy understanding what truthfully what do you think is causing all the decrease in sperm counts amongst western man\nAnd a lot of Harlem profiting off that Roosevelt\nYeah I Would I Would not dismiss that as a very ... versus well educated in the whole your area of the environment certainly\nEnvironmental toxic and have to be one of the factors but you do know that marijuana reduced the sperm counts don't you\n\nAll know no one knew that that isn't part of the new mass hysteria that marijuana is good for everything for marijuana Dr sperm counts down not up I guess you didn't read that in the New York times of the daily news is now the cure all for everything that's part of the mass hysteria marijuana is one of the reasons the stress is another reason\nSitting in front of the front of a computer is another reason in fact sitting alone make sperm count slower incidentally\nYou know there were ... I don't want to get into the biology right but it's pretty obvious a man is designed so that his sperm is housed in a organ that is outside of his body in order to keep them cooler than the body temperature\nOkay that's the way it was designed sperm these are cooler body cooler temperatures in the body temperature when a man sits for lengths of time like all day long in front of a screen\nOr sitting in a car commuting he's increasing heat in that particular an atomic all region of his body thereby um diminishing the sperm count right then and there I don't think it's that complicated\nBut then again when the common sense ever count in this country in the last Twenty years so there's your answer now Shawnee he's going to go to a bookstore tomorrow familiar not\nIncluding I'm\nWell I'm sending you want for free right now I'll be right back joined the Savage Nation coal no eight five four hundred Savage eight five or four hundred seven to eight to ...\nJust Savage Nation is sponsored by Swiss America the only company I trust with my financial future recall eight hundred to eight nine twenty six forty six or Swiss America dot com\nAre you taking my anger and tired of paying fifty dollars per camera in\nMali John catching Mary plan I think it's ten dollars per time it\nCame down his thinking ... is a fading from ... to ... come out and get free shipping on ... on my aunt Molly dry different Carolina honestly licensed in all fifty states for information and managing X. dot com icon at eight hundred for science from him when he arrived at eight hundred and four\nOr five from my fix wind\nStopped George Soros and is paid agitated before they ignite a civil war in the United states remember I alerted you to borders language and culture they are trying to destroy this nation stop mass hysteria\nYou need to own stop mass hysteria it's a history book a political book America's insanity from the Salem witch trials to the Trump witch hunt stop mass hysteria\nFun to seven nine six four or five that's F.

perfect timing for your book to come out the last few two to three weeks after a clear a mass hysteria on on Kavanaugh first of all can you define what you mean when you say a mass hysteria so that people understand\nI think they can see it all around them you see people going hysterical and invented um themes cabin or the drunk\nCabin or the serial rapist that's one example there are many many others the sky will fall if they put a moderate Republican on the Supreme Court I mean let's be clear about an hour and\nI actually didn't support cabinet when he was first chosen because he has a Bush era George Bush was to moderate and too liberal for me\nBut here you have Trump kicking amongst twenty five nominees for the Supreme Court that he had before him perhaps the most liberal Republican and look what they did to this man\nCan you imagine if a true conservative had been checked by Trump what they would be saying couldn't get any worse than what they did to this man and and here's the question is a reversal to the mass hysteria which is massive now says it's one thing for a bunch of young girls to become a historical in Salem, Massachusetts\nIn the sixteen hundreds and such and I people condemned to death for being which is based upon pure hysteria\nIt's another thing for millions and millions and millions of so called intelligence so called educated people to buy

these human beings we're known as ... wine\nAnd I've used this word ... to describe conservatives who continued to be conservative\nIn secret in this country you understand where that came from\nLet
