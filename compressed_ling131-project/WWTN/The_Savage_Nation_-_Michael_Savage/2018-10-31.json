Pittsburgh\nPresident Trump wants to sign an executive order to end American citizenship for children born in the U.S to illegal immigrants but house Speaker Paul Ryan ... radio in Lexington, Kentucky that the president cannot do that you\nPer episode and they're all big liberals every one of them is a huge liberal and make a hundred thousand three hundred thousand dollars a segment of a series and yet they won't give are known actors a chance they hog every part they run from series the series from Hulu to apple they're stealing all the money\nThat we're going to talk about a little known fact which I saw today in USA Today which is that the island nation of Jamaica\nIs the right capital of the Caribbean one of the most serious problems that's being swept under the rug that poor women are being raped down there\nLarge numbers and they should be forewarned\nNow before I Do any of this I Want to invite you to call the show later on or whatever you want to make five five foreigners Savage eight five five four seven to eight to I Want to invite you to go into a Barnes and noble store and buy your relatives a book of Saturday called stop mass hysteria\nBefore the midterms and frankly it's not too late to awaken them to America's insanity going back to the Salem witch trials\nAnd before I Do any of that I have a real treat for you today\nWhich is I've been talking about borders language and culture as my watch words since I began to radio in Nineteen Ninety four everyone knows that\nEveryone knows that I own the whole immigration subject and I'm Glad many many others are now involved with it because it's long overdue but when I began speaking about a nation's definite a nation as defined by its borders language and culture\nWas unheard of at that time no one has so clearly defined how a nation as the fine until I came along no one could do it\nIf you if you ask people how do you define what a nation is they'll bumbling around they won't come up with anything as succinct as that and when I came up with a Ninety four when I just started a radio it was revolutionary at the time and so I Want to play for you a short piece from the earth twenty ten\nWhere I talked about anchor babies and I want you to listen carefully because a lot of what you're hearing on radio today from other shows on podcasts\nOr thinking that it's all the original comes directly from what I wrote over the years and what you're about to hear from the year two thousand and ten\nDoes anyone listening to the show no why there was a fourteenth amendment\nThat grants citizenship to anyone born in the United states it was not for illegal aliens from Mexico ... harm doors Brazil\nIt was to make sure that the ... the children of slaves became citizens it was fairness and it's time right now it is a nightmare national nightmare [noise]\nNow director of the immigrant pressure groups and it's interesting to me now that the Muslims have taken over some of these immigration forums because they would like to flood America with as many ... as possible so Ali neuron the executive director of the national immigration forum which is a front group for his many illegals as possible\nSaid that eliminating birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants would be a colossal mistake all in the Ronnie\nSays it puts the United states of America on the brink of legalizing apartheid I haven't done any idea why he would say that because this has nothing to do with apartheid\nBut the question is after so many years of people like myself talking about the flood of illegal aliens into America remember I founded the show\nA circa Nineteen Ninety four and I coined that phrase borders language and culture\nAnd now it's become something of a watch word for most people in radio they understand that our borders have been destroyed by our government that our language has been ... and destroyed by those who it turns into a triangle nation where English becomes a minority language and culture what culture you're talking about the American flag they burn them\nThey spit on them and now they say they're shocked to seat prominent members of Congress suddenly embracing it such as the so called prominent Lindsey Graham who is not as prominent as you may think but nevertheless I'm asking you the audience or the Savage Nation do you think\nIs that birthright citizenship should be eliminated\nThat's the show today rise scene in birds to illegal dwellers that's what the vermin USA Today called illegal aliens and out of ... how in the world you can call someone who snuck into a country\nInvaded a nation and Paris of ties with it by taking free things that they're not entitled to to to age well er I don't know unless you're insane I wouldn't call them dwellers I call them something else that I've had enough of it\nThis debate on birthright citizenship has been long overdue I've been waiting here since Nineteen Ninety four for this debate to finally percolate up to the average person but now when I see it on the front page of the usa away newspaper I realize it's time for us to talk about it\nIs it time for the fourteenth amendment to go\nWar should everyone who comes to America who drops the baby on our doorstep be entitled to have an anchor baby after all their their children just like your your you know your children\nThey're all equal everyone is equal on earth there should be no borders or some of these liberals talk you wouldn't believe what they're talking about they don't know what the hell is saying there should be no borders no language and culture that's their idea of a perfect world\nIt's not my idea of a perfect world that's not what your ancestors for to die for it was not to see a man of the uh of the letter say a a quality of Obama as president\nOr Congress as low as lying and as corrupt as this one could never have a card if we had a legitimate press in this country that acted in the way the press was supposed to act which is a watchdog for the average person not as a lap dogs for both parties and that's what talk radio comes in\nWe are the watchdogs for America\nDoes it make us tough guys know it makes us guys that you need more than you may know\nBiggest without us what you'd have I'll tell you exactly what you have you would have less than a banana republic or not for people like Michael Savage willing to take the chance is necessary to expose the corruption and greed in our government and so I throw the question to you again is it time to get rid of the fourteenth amendment\nAnd no more birthright citizenship\nFor what [noise]\nWell they asked the question of the day that's the number one question should Trump through an executive order and then of course we know that um it will be challenged by one or the left wing operatives\nIn the court system but here's the good news he's the good news it'll go to the Supreme Court in a couple years and you want to have a really good news now it's our Supreme Court isn't that a good feeling and we've only just gotten started cabinet was just the beginning of the conservative majority\nDo you realize over the next few years it's highly probable that Trump will have at least one perhaps to more Supreme Court justices to place on the Supreme Court it's our Supreme Court now and I shall return\n...
