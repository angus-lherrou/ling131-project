is white men most of them radicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them there is no ban on you know they have the Muslim land there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nThis guy is a stone haunted racist who has no place in the American media landscape and yet he is on and they were afraid to fire him now Jeff Zucker should be fired as well because this isn't the first time this man has done something like this\nIn twenty Fifteen over thirty thousand people signed a petition demanding that lemonade be fired from CNN after he attacked police\nWhen Donald Trump became president\nIn January twenty Eighteen John lemonade the racist in my opinion Don lemonade introduced his broadcast on CNN with this this is CNN Tonight I'm Don Lemon the president of the United states is a racist\nAnd yet Jeff Zucker does not fire him Warner broadcasting does not fire him a TNT does not fire him so let's look into Don lemons background because now I'm interested to see why you so twisted and how he's gotten so far as a a hateful person\nYou went to a Baker high school in east Baton Rouge\nThen he went to Brooklyn College which said he majored in broadcast journalism it doesn't say graduated\nThan the attendance last year we don't know if he graduated but apparently oh into the hiring laws in America he was moved right up to this position rapidly began as a news assistant little little station then move right up and here he is\nAnd he has spoken about a lot of issues\nIn September twenty ten lemonade said that he was a victim of sexual abuse as a child and it was not until he was Thirty years old he told his mother about it I'm reading from a computer in his memoir\nCalled trance parents Don lemonade came out as gay\nAnd discuss this color is in the black community I don't know what that is never heard of it and I I like to think I Know words but I guess there's a thing I never heard about called color as him in the black community\nAnd the sexual abuse he suffered as a child he has Creole ancestry is great grandfather was a French descent in addition to Nigeria and Cameroon and Congolese ancestry\nIn January thirtieth on January thirty first twenty eight team no that's this year lemons sister died at the age of fifty eight police concluded that a death was an accidental drowning in upon while fishing\nAfter being absent for approximately a week lemonade open the show unfair every six by thinking everyone who wish to impress onwards encourage Mitt mhm he\nSaid that conservatives like Sean Hannity were among the first to call out cynical can you get\nAnd they actually respect each other out good rely on them of course that is so typical of the wall Bangor have good relations now why was showing at all you have good relations with a lot like this and work behind the scenes to make certain that I'm destroyed I think you can figure this out because he knows lemonade is not a threat to him\nLemon was only one of a hundred and fifty most influential African Americans were ebony magma limits working on the list of war you're twenty four the lemons work was named it all is the worst journalism the year by the Columbia Journalism review first question about Malaysia Airlines flight three Seventy\nSpanking children you know and the U.S army POW Bowe Bergdahl he suggested to an electric bill Cosby rape victim should have resisted all sects biting him despite claiming in his book to be a victim of sexual abuse himself there's not much here that you can really\nUse in coming to a conclusion as to how an overtly racist man\nHolds such a position of CNN other than perhaps the payout would be so high and they'd be afraid of being accused of being racist themselves if they got rid of him because they certainly have to understand\nThat their advertisers on CNN that could be boycotted by people like you who listen to the show I'd been subject to boycotts for twenty five years and yet this loud is not subject to boycott so go figure that out\nAll right well you could let me talk on this for a little bit more boycott ATM through the parent company I think he'd rather talk about other topics you saying what's new about that no I think you can't let this go I'm Sorry you cannot let this go\nYou can't let things like this go because the hatred for whites now is becoming and that Mick in the United states of America and it's one thing for idiots with low IQ's to be able to say it on Twitter it's quite another thing for this anti white racism\nTo be prime you'll gated on major media like CNN make no mistake about it this is what triggers whites at the bottom to become psychotic killers is this kind of words these kind of words remember what power will remember I have a radio show where I can attack this guy to what he's doing\nAnd it gets to that in my system but many of you are listening to the show you have no outlet whatsoever\nMaybe you are I'm poor maybe you have a bad job maybe your wife has cancer maybe you yourself are sick what do you think those of you will not like that this is doing to them when they hear a man like they're saying that men like them should be banned from America\nThe biggest terror threat in this country is white men or we have to start doing something about them what do you mean by doing something about them round up white males white males in jail throw white males out of the country what does he mean so now if you're a guy in the bottom and you're sitting there listening to this", "show_name": "The
