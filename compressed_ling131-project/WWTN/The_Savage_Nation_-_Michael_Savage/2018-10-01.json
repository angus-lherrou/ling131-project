I found Brett Kavanaugh people even though there was such a notion\nFrom falsely accused innocent man who in the in the court of public opinion and they are they leading up to this oh unquote hearing a life with completely turned upside down his wife was getting that threat\nAnd his career with cooking the entirely sabotage and destroyed as well as his reputation and here we have Christine horn and I can't believe that something happened to her\nShe obviously has been in therapy for ... H A she has set herself she has two front doors you know anybody that has to front door bell no there's no snow so obviously she had issues now it just because she says something happened doesn't happen\nAnd we have plenty of examples that or the it gift because she says Brett Kavanaugh raped or maybe not but all the evidence that she's for that so far fall short of being out of it ends\nIn fact if you present innocent of Cornwall in which the so called victim provides for names Brett Kavanaugh mark judge PJ Smith labeling Kaiser including her best girlfriend legal in God's or\nWho would have no motivation on line or allied all who said I don't even know where I live in all\nThe all of them said the event didn't happen including mark judge you wrote on the floor supposedly with the with bread Kevin on Christine forward he said it did not get discount more judging okay what about PJ Smith who simply a classmate\nWho said these events never took place when Christine Ford's said they did then wheeling Kaiser her best girlfriend said they didn't happen but she also said I believer why believer but they didn't happen I don't know I don't know how that works at all and then you have are saying that well\nI I was flabbergasted when Trump running for the presidency and twenty sixteen what the name of bread cabin on the Supreme Court list fact the matter is he didn't put his name on the list when he was running it didn't happen till November twenty Seventeen so how could you be frightened during the campaign\nAbout bread Kevin are getting the Supreme Court when his name one on the list at all\nAnd how can she be believable to those are like you just mentioned Chris Wallace Karl Rove and not all the time is up I don't know\nBecause I ... exactly what were they watching and hear like you said when I had a sexual harassment case it fell short of being an assault case however I had the burden of proof that was my responsibility short order for a present the evidence I had to be cross examined I had to beat the post let me tell you something\nI wasn't given lawyers from the defensive side that tripped me with kid gloves no okay it was a very uncomfortable hearing solved it talks about equal rights and gender equality will you know what\nI was treated not as a woman not as bad as a person bringing bringing forward charges against another person\nTo watch that lawyer that the Republicans hired treat her as though she were a child she's a doctor and not take the opportunity to necessarily poke holes in them any stories that she had concocted she didn't like to fly\nSo they continue to ignore the members of their own party with these allegations that you know what I'd like to know though I Want to know which senators spent Seventeen million dollars in tax payer money to cover up there on sexual indiscretions\nThere on sexual harassment and assault against their staff or what if somebody sitting on the Judiciary Committee\nKept a secret did in the U.S Senate and the Congress all the private settlement Seventeen million dollars never got out did it\n[noise] no I\nKnow here we have people lecturing another example Kamala Harris\nShe's talking about integrity and she's like shrinks Brett Kavanaugh at that hearing Kamala Harris\nGot her start on one of the brown casting couch she was having a public affair with a married man when she was assistant da and ... says go and Willie Brown with the mayor of San Francisco so I don't need a feminist\nLike Kamala Harris tiny how I should live my life or others should live their life and she has never had to explain those types of actions what would the me too movement say about a woman having an affair with a married man what about the Mary amounts of life\nYou know how about Cory Booker sexually molesting a Fifteen year old girl US Senator from New Jersey no big deal right\nRight\nWell we got her on ... you're the best we'll see what happens in a few days but dye pray to God Brett Kavanaugh's confirmed and all this crap sorting out really be the\nDemocrats though we beat this that's kind of politics the personal instructional character assassination at the poll we need to make sure that we show up and numbers that they can't handle and we make sure that we keep the house and keep the Senate and even grow the house\nMegan bar if you're a great American thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show thank you very much thanks so much about uh let's continue with more Kamala Harris cutter jobs on the casting couch Amir Willie Brown who was married to continue with more built counting him live with you every Sunday night\nYou know what's going on and talk about it with Michael from nine to new and banned from New York We're talking about ...

wasn't that the president said he would get a free trade agreement done what he said was he will get a free trade agreement\nThat will get rid of the trade deficit\n\nNow I Know the president will be out and he will be selling this irrespective of what is in the free trade agreement and the people that love the president will say he did exactly what he said he was going to do I'm fine with that as long as he heads in reality he\nBut he initially said he was going to do\nWell you know [noise]\nI I'm just fine with everything if they'll just get behind us you know the the the moving of well we'll do this much more of a here and and this much less over here\nIt really isn't because there's there's been no promise the only thing I've seen in terms of the measurement of the dairy agreement\nIs that it will mirror that of the the agreement that Canada just reached with Europe and other other countries other parts of the world so I have no idea what that means for the U.S\nI don't know how to quantify that and it it again [laughter] there was no um target right there was nothing\nWhere they said look we must get this much increase for the dairy farmers of of the U.S you know we're this is what we're working on this is who were working on behalf of so I don't there was never this this\nI guess line or or go for them to reach the administration in fact just a few days ago they were saying yeah we're way too far apart to be reaching a deal before the deadline and ... and here we are a few days later\nSo we have no idea what it means and how much of an increase for those dairy farmers in terms of being able to sell the camp Canada that is\nYou know what I didn't hear mentioned it all ... and ... article but right now it's early on and maybe and maybe tomorrow nothing on the soft amber\nNo I I didn't see anything on that and so the only two hours as I did see a lot dairy and automobiles settle that so I I guess my ... and by the way when we say win or lose we're not talking about win or lose by our standards because women lewd by our standards with trading with Canada\nShould be free trade across the board no tariffs no limits or anything if Canada puts tariffs on that's wrong if the United states put tariffs on a you know uh uh the batters wrong but is that where we made the compromise on soft timber and that's why you\nDidn't hear the administration come out and talk about you know the the the soft timber\nThan we upset okay we're not remember they were going after the soft timber industry claiming that the government subsidizes it in Canada right ah and with the duties and whatever put on soft timber\nAs we know a construction in the United states will become has and will become more expensive which will hurt the bottom line of the GDP\nSo I you know that look there's a there's a ton of things here and you just mentioned something that just a couple of days ago we're way far off we're not going to have a deal well the president knew that he had\nTo have Canada in the dealer was a no go in Congress wasn't going to go anywhere right so he was under that he was under that pressure to come up with some kind of deal otherwise it wouldn't go through when he had to get it done now\nBecause they want it done before December first when the Mexican president does out right so we're why did that sixty day deadline it's got to be done now\nSo there was pressure on the administration did the administration crumble on parts that they wanted I guess we shall see\nIt was interesting that ah read a couple of articles on the last couple of weeks from Canada where they said you know what the Canadian government decided to do we're just not going to respond to Trump on anything ... he can sit there and script just be quiet say nothing\nDon't give them a target back don't say anything and so if you if you think the Canadians have been quiet lately because of it\nThat was their whole purpose let's just be quiet but Canada knew that they they look they understood had understood that look one of the things that we have against the United states in this deal is Trump has\nTo get it done he's got to get it done by a certain time period otherwise you know the Congress is not going to pass a trade deal that separate from Mexico and therefore that's the pressure they had on the administration\nI guess we shall see well yeah it it here's what I don't fear right now I don't fear any um any promotion of of a a massive I guess concession by Canada by the administration you\nKnow cause they dairies tiny ... and that's that's the whole thing is that the movement if there were big movement here we we know about it already that would be in the media that would be the story that Trump claimed\nThe following\nSo again how much of a victory as it did it do anything did it change anything and if we haven't gotten the steel and aluminum tariffs done\nThen what does that look like\nBecause that ... that right now if you look at what is really impact of the economy so far it's been it's been that just the threat of those when they started talking about those tariffs\nSo let me ask you this is it ... are we at a point where both Mexico and Canada because we talked about how not a lot of details and promote about Mexico right so we just to the point where they said look we both got to say we have an agreement to start the clock ticking for the next sixty days\nRight\nWe've come to terms and will work out the details later and we've pushed off the deadline for now\nThan we have a lot of stuff to talk about including that a cabin on the FBI investigation or how the goalposts have been moved remember last week I said that they moved the goalpost\nAre basically from a a a you know a a an American ... American football the Canadian football now I think the goalposts moved at the soccer field now it's that even that ... that much longer now\n... years ago ... keep moving with the Democrats will get to that plus your calls and comments we had a great show ahead if you'd like to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I told ... ... ...
