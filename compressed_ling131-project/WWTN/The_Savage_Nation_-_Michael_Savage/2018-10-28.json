send a picture oftentimes\nExplicit pictures they believe there are no ramifications yeah right what teens don't realize is that the recipient tell teams is all over the country the recipient can easily screen shot that photo and use it in ways that weren't originally intended\nThe results of course range from public humiliation tarnished reputation bullying and eat a legal stuff I mean there

mass shooting up the tree of life synagogue was held in Pittsburgh tonight\nA definition of right and wrong considerably changed edited adapted particularly just in the last twelve months in culture\nAs I mentioned moments ago to many students right it's no longer right wrong is no longer wrong and sadly what what builds good at what wins challenge most students with whom I talk ... listen to this this is the summary statements of most students that are made across our nation\nMost students with him on whom I Believe that it is okay to do anything you want\nWhat you want to as long as it works for you in the moment\nHey if if you want proof of it is getting a room full of students college students middle schoolers high schoolers get in a room full of students and ask each of them for an authentic discussion involving topics such as\nEuthanasia or suicide or gay marriage or abortion or religious tolerance I mean do you pick the topic\nSadly you're going to see that students many of whom have grown up together who do church together and many who say they're Christ followers they're going to have very interpretations and beliefs about what is right\nIn about what is wrong the reason for this isn't just the people have different opinions no the deep meaning of this and this is why we're covering this ... this is why this matters for us as families the reason isn't just because they have different opinions the reason is because there are no longer absolutes for this generation\nThere is no guiding force there is no biblical belief up on which they base\nTheir their facts or their evidence it is simply okay what feels good to me is right in what feels good to you is right I find is\nHarmful belief system permeating the lives of both Christian and non Christian teams for for instance let me tell you that\nI was at a conference recently\nAnd I explained that links the ideas that I've just been mentioning to use and then I asked OK so out of curiosity sort of like twelve hundred students in the room\nI ask don't get out of curiosity how ... how many of you believe there is an absolute truth and I had I had the students raise their hand in a room of more than twelve hundred teens again I asked them how many have you believe there is an absolute truth mean that there there's a right and there was a wrong\nLess than one hundred students in this room raised their hand\nOver twelve hundred at this conference how many believed there is an absolute truth left them one hundred that tells me should this shock you really didn't shock me it's sad it's scary but it's the reality that tells me that at least in that little personal experiment but only about ten percent\nOf the students attending this conference who say Christ guides their lives to believe that things can be absolutely considered right and things can be absolutely considered wrong that tells me this the flip side is is when it comes to morality when it comes to ethics the other Ninety percent\nAnd they just kinda go with their gut so there's this dilemma I decide what his ride I decide what is wrong let me get one more the dilemma I call the sin is in a dilemma\nIn several weeks ago I was asked to speak about\nMy daughter's a school and I am I'm excited about the opportunity to be able to speak there and and I know that there's going to be\nThis opportunity bill Scheer truths with these kids I've spoken to this school before and I spoke are there a couple of years ago I remember um I met a girl there she told me that she said I really don't see a big difference in the way Christian a non Christian people should live\nWe all do the same stuff\nWhether it be good or bad we never really blink an eye I remember telling me to speak at the school again she says I really do see a difference in in the way my Christian and non Christian friends live\nSome scary stuff parents is telling me that we live in a world where simply what works for you is what works for you and what works for me is what works for me and it's all good\nAnd I don't see anywhere here's my faith coming through here for a moment and I don't see anywhere in God's word that the Bible tell us that we just blend in with the world and become whatever the world since we should be no matter of fact Jesus said and John he said you know what's\nThe world's going hey they're gonna hate you for what you're going to believe\nAnd there's a possibility [noise] they're going to kill you for what you believe the world has received so many of our kids into believing that\nTheir choices are no big deal\nBut they can live as they\nCan become whoever they want to ride wrong [noise]\nDoesn't really matter at the culture that's where we are scary stuff scares me to talk about it [noise] you know what study feels show the mom and dad have the loudest voice influencing their\nKids ears I sure hope using it this is Jeffrey Jeffrey new show\nWere back in a moment

fulfill their desires and their needs and the curiosity and that is what's tonight subject of our email of the night\n\nIn the mail of the night [noise] [noise]\nSo parents emailed me this week that said if my husband and I recently learned that our tenth\nGrade son is questioning all of his beliefs about God and about faith she says you can imagine are shock or son says he's a Christian he's heavily involved in church he's in argued praised band plays guitar he said for years that he wants to working missions after college parrots\nDespair tells me we're now questioning everything we did we're wondering where to go from here it's just no surprise that I get similar emails I get Facebook messages like this more and more\nFrom parents literally overwhelmed with the realization that a son or daughter is struggling with their face\nAnd obviously you know I I Can't answer this without talking about my faith but I have to say this our enemy he's working overtime using the world stage too\nKids that God if he if he does exist that he's no longer real and daddy's he's no longer relevant here in the year twenty Eighteen listen if you've got a son or daughter who's in a similar place\nI Know that I Know that I Can't clean all this up and just a few minutes here on the show tonight but I Do want to encourage you to stay the course\nI truly want to encourage you to stay the course he or she may be questioning it all but this doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong not I I don't know your situation I don't know if you don't ride or you've done wrong but I but I can say this\nJust because our kids make poor choices doesn't always mean that the parenting has been poor\nAnd I I Want to stress that on the show 'cause a lot of times I'm encouraging us to get better and I hope the mayor before my face every time I say that because we as parents we we got an never never buy the lie that we can't keep growing and we can't keep getting better every single one of us listening whether you're a parent or not of course that's just\nThat's a good medicine for us all but I I Want to remind parents and this is one of the scariest\nThis is the scariest things about parenting right now that you know it's easy to buy the law will if my kids have blown it I've blown it and that may be the case\nBut it isn't always the case we have a Paris listen we have a world determined to take our kids down the wrong road\nWe have a world right now determined to take our kids down a wrong wrong and particularly this parrot who wrote in asking about whether or not they've made it happen or not and whether or not they messed up or not\nI don't know for sure your situation but I but I can tell you this here here's what the Bible says the Bible says that there is a time and this is in second Timothy a book in the New Testament very important versus for everyone listening tonight\nThe Bible says that a time is coming a time is coming when people won't listen to write teaching instead listen to what the Bible says instead they will look for teachers who tell them what their itching ears long to hear\nThis is where we are in culture right now\nThere are people right now who are telling your kids simply what it is that they want to hear we have a generation of students listening to a world telling them what it is that they want to hear\nThat's a very scary place that we find ourselves in the summers was very brilliant when he wrote lead me and your truth\nAnd teach me your truth Paris I got to tell you this is the rally cry this is the rally cry of every kid whether he or she knows it or not because I Am of the belief every single one of us are born into this life in a desperate need to know our creator\nWhether you'd give credit to him or not there is a time when you're going to find out if not in his life in the afterlife\nThe guy wasn't jacking around when he ... he had a plan for you he had a purpose for you he is the real deal in families we have to fight for this stuff I I write about this at all of my books and my first book for parents called the fight of your life\nMay not toward this up a killed and I talked in constantly about the fight that families are in their parents listen you have to see it as a fight\nYou have to realize that there's there's a fight going on and it's tough and its bloody and this long and there's going to be times just like the ... who sent me this email this week\nWhen it's going to feel like you're not doing a good job and it's going to hurt in those moments\nYou've got to stay the course I Know there are parents listening tonight who are scared we got the scary thing going on and our producer limit it gives us has some great fun scary music forced to listen and all serious right now here in this moment I Know there are some parents right now who are scared like crazy\nOur role as parents cannot be to always shelter and protect them from such moments but but when we can do is use the moments we have with them to build confidence and to instill values\nTo remind them of everything we've we've talked about tonight as it relates to never having to try to be anyone or anything other than the person they are a key to this\nIs time parents I encourage you if you missed any part of the show tonight he grabbed the podcast our potash into show always populate every Sunday by midnight now we have other pod cast of their own are pod cast a family strong pod cast with jeopardy dean\nOr just Google families Trump ... great Dane or go to any podcast platform you'll find it again family strong password jeopardy but if you missed any part of the shows and I\nDon't you go grab it listen we've given you just a lot of stuff not to think about just a lot of scary stuff\nGoing on in the culture and the key really all comes down to this word time an ... you know this the one of the scariest truth about impacting families today is that if you actually make time to be together\nAn online research study group recent recently released the results from a new survey that showed American adults let me say this again American adults\nSpend up to three hours a day on social media\nThree hours a day the same study showed that the average family lifted up the average family spins just a fraction of that time together today Americans sadly Americans are spending a mayor thirty seven minutes of quality time together each day\nThirty seven minutes they'll listen I just exposed the scary truth evidence to the reason why so many of our kids are hungry for attention for love and for truth I don't have a statistic\nTo support what I'm saying here but I can tell you\nAfter countless conversations with boys and girls across America the last twenty five years I Believe this to be true kids whose moms and dads are intricately involved in their lives\nAre less likely to self harm to contemplate suicide to fill devalued to sleep with their boyfriend or girlfriend when students tell me their heartbreak stories I almost always first ask what's life at home like with mom and dad\nAnd an editor believed the response is consistently something to the effect of all I don't I don't talk with him about this or a ... I'm not close to my parents or they don't even know what's really going on in my life so\nHow do we create time moments with our kids\nHow to how do we do this whether the ways or new herbal but let me before we and to not\nLet me quickly offer three before we had to the house the the first is is parents number one ... quality time you know this quality time it can be any time there is never a bad time to engage with your son or daughter there just isn't but you have to be the one to make that time count\nI find that kids one time with their parents even though they don't say they do and sometimes even though they don't know\nThey do but I find this to be the case all the time in a in a recent online survey teams were asked the question if you could improve one thing about your relationship with your parents what would you change overwhelmingly kids answered more time together\nParents realize quality time can be anytime secondly communicate to your child I'm approachable and I'm a shock of all parents did you hear this\nYou must communicate to your kids even if you're not using the two words in just the message of truth that you speak into their lives in the the time that you were available to dinner with them you must communicate to them I'm approachable\nAnd I am in shock ... listen your daughter lives in the world that tells her to live by what I called the three S's be skinny be sexy beast bloody\nThat's the world of girls today your son lives in the world that tells them you've got to be cut you got to be popular and you've got to sleep with just about any girl who will\nThat's the one about gas today to compete you've got to be willing to go there with any conversation important to your son or daughter any conversation\nListen your daughter has questions about her body your son he's curious about sex she's interested in dating he has feelings and insecurities and questions and pad passions and interest and desires and fears and dreams and goals and board the more we talk with our kids about this real stuff\nThe intimate stuff the hard questions stuff the more they see us as approachable\nThe more they see us as a shock ball impairs let me give you another one make home they're haven\n... it's a good place rest and to not make home there have been you know this life is busy it's confusing it's demanding\nIs challenging for our kids we as parents have to work hard to create a home environment a place of peace and joy\nOf comfort sometimes as parents we take things a little I think too seriously and we forget our kids just want to be kids they just want to know when school work is just a little too much work\nNo when they need to take a break from homework\nGo get some ice cream let them stay up a little late every now and there and remember they long to be long so create this environment of home that reminds your kids hey baby you belong here\nHere's a really good safe comfortable peaceful place for you know parents let me let me say this we could tackle so much more tonight we're about to wrap the show will bring it back again next week will handle the pod cast tomorrow listen after listening to these scary truths these trends impacting our kids\nYou made me feel a little burdened little little overwhelmed\nA little concerned about the state of today's\nStudent generation about your your elementary kids

life you may be a person of faith maybe you're not a person of faith but I'll tell you this and when you choose to give gotta try he never let you down\nHe will never let you down there is an enemy there's a world press an end to tell you otherwise but I'm telling you God's got it he's created you it's no mistake it's no coincidence your parents and your kids are looking to you for truth they're looking to you for significance\nTheir list listening there watching how you live shaped how they live even when you're not talking they're learning from what your life is saying so one challenge\nWhen triumphant moment one tragedy at a time let's teach our kids what it means rather than look to the world to look to us and hopefully more importantly see a God and that is worth following\nParents our kids are learning by [noise]\nBy watching are left\nThe hope you'll take it every day\nAnd you'll kill it hey thanks for joining the conversation tonight and now\nThe real

Mandel all of this prosperity and not only dismantling the totally reverse it they want to take your money\nWhich are not going to have as much by the way once the economy starts to go to tank because they do away with the tax cuts and not to mention you're going to have as much money in your body because they're doing away with the tax cuts and then they're going to take that money they're going

[noise]\n\nOr the victim more than a thousand people held candles and sang at a vigil\nHonoring those who were killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue after a gunman barge did an open fire the city's public safety director called it a horrific crime scene federal authorities planned to file hate crime and other charges against the gunman who had expressed anti Semitic views on social media\nThat who was wounded in a shootout with police the President Trump called the shooting a wicked active mass murder they just pure evil adding anti Semitism must be confronted anywhere and everywhere it appears ... Pittsburgh\nSo you have these people sitting and this is the thing they can figure this out where we can't be divisive what do we do well based on a lack of evidence we must blame one side and we have a complete lack of evidence\nThat they've been involved in this because we know nothing about it we do nothing except these were suspicious packages we have no idea who sent them we have no idea what the political motivation\nIs behind it we still don't know whether these were alive bombs are not Eric as you and I write that brought\nAbout when we looked at this by the way the national review also so we just mentioned Andrew McCarthy's column but the national review had a story last uh last night that said that both Obama and the powder harmless than they quoted a social one ... CNN yeah the one side to CNN yes the one that was sent to to CNN was um\n[noise] uh the powder was harmless and but when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I look at each other said man you've got to parks everything these days you got to be very careful ... ... it says the powder the outer right without her along with the bomb right that was and it it was a ...\nThere's ... there's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any source says that the a suspicious package that was sent there all the explosive device potentially explosive device\nWas was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to us\nRight and and early in the day the NYPD had bad\nThat the um uh but the uh the ... there was the the the suspected\nPipe bomb and another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice or would they suspected it might be right center you know who knows [noise] um but it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both the bomb and the powder are harmless were harmless and we looked at\nYou know who they source for that which was Associated Press an Associated Press nowhere and their says yeah that the that their sources of the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because\nFrom what I've seen and what I have read the FBI has not come out and said these were bomb no no these were alive bombs ready to go off of space\nJust in nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using the authorities have been using but the media's been using\nBecause for me what is the media do inevitably they bring on as they're covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert and then they look at it\nExcept they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be and and so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here\nSo I suppose it is somebody that supports the president and the Republicans well do you just heard the side that you support if that's right ... found out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case in that somebody who just\nWrite but less than two weeks before a major election you would just hurt their chances\nAnd and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a ... and we've said this all along but there was a rush rush in collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigative ... your point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay\nUh when we find out if they were you know lie bombs ... well then\nYou know that without question was an attempt to kill these people that would end so right you go around the problem\nYou go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was they find out that none of the bombs were active that none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things or if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature ... it was meant just a couple of weeks before an election\nTo help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the\nThe motivation here was to help drive an election to a a certain side mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it's if they did this to help Trump did to help Trump\nAnd then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN it going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive comments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive\nThan accusing another side or a person\nBlaming them for something where there is a complete lack of evidence says to the motivation\nOf the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm\nNow see I'm not jumping out of China and assigning it says something nothing could be nothing could be more divisive source they sit there on their high horse screaming that your devices they had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side that it's not possible she's shut the door on that just days ago\nWell look this this is where we we have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after steep skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress\nAs possible would you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and no no no and\nNone of it's going to all of this has to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers claiming\nThat they care about civility and they are anti divisive that's what they're about and they hate the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWould they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there is no evidence either way there's no evidence\nAnd we may not have it for a long time\nAnd the fact is they don't see that no they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack\nUnderstands how obvious it is so not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a ... there's a again\nA we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm not much you\nCan say the only thing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI\nOr they were sent to you know prominent members ah or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so that's all we can say\nThat's it that's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story that we can talk\nAbout it but right now\nAbout without knowing the motivation unless that person comes

whether we talk about the issues and talked about the substance of the ideas is because we believe that we can explain them easy and the majority of Americans will agree with us\nWe have fun at times we sort of fake name call at times you know and and the worst we ever call anybody who's an idiot because we call ourselves idiots\n[laughter] and and that's really about the the ... the worst that we um we do we get passionate at at times but that's one of the reasons we've always said for any Republican out there you don't need to use\nAny type of of rhetoric that the opposition can ever used against you in any way it's part of the discussion\nThat we've had over the last couple of days for Republicans and\nAnd the president and general take the winning move on take the take the ... that's

I'm not sure I'll get back to you on that one it's one of the reasons why we really we ask questions on many issues but we don't speculators fact\nNow we don't speculate to the point of conclusion right I'm On things that we don't have all the facts on 'em and and that's what it comes down to for me is that uh you the\nFrustration I think right now is the with me at least is the fact that for the first time in a long time the Republican Party is motivated by a president\nWho on many ... economic things and national things can get things done mhm focus on those but beyond that\nBuild momentum forward and you know I've got a couple of emails from yesterday's show you know in talking about well you think that people are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and blah blah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with them they hold on a second you missed part of the conversation\nWe're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle that win elections for you right that's who you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially to put it in the president's ah you know we'll house to to new customers\nBy the by the way I don't know I I I answered the the one email from the one woman who wrote that\nThe the the one that because it sounds like that's when you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll get my mind and in the end and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look not talking about you arrive yeah this was going to change it I'm not talking about my I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know\nWell I Know that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and
