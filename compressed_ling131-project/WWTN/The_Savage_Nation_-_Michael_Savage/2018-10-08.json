I was telling you to you about a woman's\nPerspective and I made this point with her about two weeks ago then I'm of course a man you might be a woman but if you're a woman you're probably married to a man or was married to a man or want to be married to a man\nYour father was a man what kind of feelings damn towards your husband and your dad your brothers are male what kind of feelings damp tore them and you may have male children or grandchildren you want to live in a world where because of your gender your automatically just believed or believed\nIn other words every now and then a woman lies and every now and then the man is not guilty of rape\nOr sexual assault happens all the time\nSo you can't say because a woman speaks we must listen or because a man is charged he's got to shut up\nThere was a line to be murdered merged between the me too movement on one hand and wound up ... percent acceptance on the other\nAnd in fact you want to believe a victim of a crime which I naturally would do as a criminal defense attorney a take off my head and I generally believe all of a person's as their car was stolen\nOr a person says my house was burglar eyes or a victim of an arson or a victim of sexual assault my naturally want to believe that person\nBut then if a person is charged I Want to live in a world that says that person is due process rights because that is the rigorous reaction of subsidies heaven procedural due process\nThat pursues the truth and make sure that those are telling the truth or concerns and those that are lying or rejected\nAnd Democrats never wanted to put professor forward through a any rigorous process to determine what she was saying was accurate now here we are several days later\nAfter she testified what about ten days ago that practically everything she said was false including the number of people that attacked or what had happened how it happened that how old she was\nThe timeframe that happened in the two front door was a kind of hard\nFearing to fly was ridiculous and her boyfriend came out and said she was a safe\nAnd some of these other facts come out and you're thinking now wait a minute maybe what I heard originally\nIs not accurate when Chris Wallace of Fox News after she testified said the Republicans are in trouble I thought to myself\nNow hold up on that car let's find out what Brett Kavanaugh has to say and now that she's testified there's going to be a several day process to check out what she says is if it's accurate the two front doors was either a misrepresentation or a lie\nBecause the front door went in and twenty oh eight not twenty twelve and it went in not because she needed an extra way out but because a small business owner a therapist\nWant it to rent a part of her house and she wanted to separate entrance for her patients which was the second front door and had nothing to do it cost her phobia\nThen the boring friend follows the affidavit saying we flew little planes all over French Polynesia and painting and uh Hawaii we also went on trips to Central America to South America and Europe she had no fear of flying it was a lie\nIn fact there was nothing she said ... that turn out to be accurate but see the Democratic party didn't care about finding the truth\nThey had a ball face mitigated allegation that could not stand the rigors of due process so they quickly ignored and said if you want to get into the veracity pursuit were not with you on that she said\nShe as mainly X chromosomes therefore we believer and the person with the Y chromosome ... that's a liar\nBut then the truth came out and it's like well don't don't bother me with the facts that's what caused a writer for the call bears CBS late night show to say quote aerial doom is said quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote\nFat is reflective and indicative of what the Democratic Party things today about Brett Kavanaugh we ruined his life were ruined his wife were ruined his mom and dad and were ruined his daughters\nSo aerial do most of this team of Kobe or show quote whatever happens I'm just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaugh as life unquote that's where they are don't care about his qualifications it's constitutional principles his academic scholarship it kind of person he is\nThey want to ruin someone's life\nAnd they're happy that he can't coach a girls' basketball team anymore north teach at Harvard according to Stephen Colbert Irish writer we've ruined his life\nNow we're feeling pretty good [noise] you want to stand with that

continue\nLet's go now to Mike in Wisconsin Mike in Wisconsin welcome to the bill Cunningham show my yard\nA great really how are you good really I think we need to learn from experience and you had an earlier caller I think it was prior maybe at it and that was an inspiring phone call because he like he was a traditional Democrat and he's now come over to our side\nHow are we going to get more people to come over our side I think there are three ways [noise] number three I think there are people like Brian saw\nNot only dishonest they are downright evil they will soup that nothing to get a power\nNumber two that Democrats looks socialist progress is incapable of analyzing back whether it be about climate change ... whether it be the lives that that Dr Ford presented in front of the Senate tradition\nTrue provable lies that we still are ignored by the mainstream media provable lie\nI Want to be ... say they're misconceptions\nBut damn it they were alive because she lied about flying she lied about that second front door she lied about them for boys became one she lied about her late teens now it's Fifteen he lied about the fact that was the mid nineties eighties Nineteen eighty two because Greg Kavanaugh in the mid eighties was in Connecticut she lied lied lied\nAnd she wasn't covered because she was a woman\nThat's right and and really let me tell you the most important thing that we learned and that is that we Republicans we didn't stand up to them before they took advantage of our moral character and we learned this time that the only way to like that is by\nOn his political force hats off to McConnell yep I talked to Collins hats off to Lindsey Graham about that political forces the only way that we're going to eat them and we can avoid a civil war as your last guest said how can we do that by Bruce waiting for my beat him in at the ballot\nGot away and you got to vote you got to you know Schumer said one thing Saturday and that was correct you got to vote in the Denver if you take away the Democratic party from the coast and about seven or eight major cities\nThere's no Democrats hardly anywhere there's this sea of red from seed a shining city it say irrelevant minimalist party but the problem is the mainstream media is there a megaphone ... and the major media will not cover objectively this president nor any Republican president\nThey didn't cover Alito correctly that didn't cover Roberts here and look what they did a cabin all look what's next to Amy Coney Barrett ought to be the next Supreme Court justice\nAnd from Notre Dame and when that happens all hell is going to break loose and Barbie gene ... made certain maker you walk that fight\n[laughter] really getting it affect you today to hear Eric Holder who scale contempt of Congress said that now we have to call into question the legitimacy of this of the Supreme Court let me see Billy\nThe last forty years since Nineteen thirty seven cents conservatives had a majority on the Supreme Court we never questioned malignancy of a prominent but now all of a sudden when we go through a legitimate process of confirmation\nAll of a sudden they stand up and say we've got to question the whole legitimate you process\nDo you recall outrageous you recall in the third debate that Trump made a Trump was asked whether or not if he lost the election if he would accept it and the media has a meltdown when Trump made a statement to the fact that he might not accept\nThe results in November elections if he felt it was rigged against him and the media Hillary Clinton New York times jumped on top of Trump because he would not accept the results of the election everyone thought a core sailor who's gonna win\nAnd then Trump won and up to this point Hillary and a major media has\nNot accepted the outcome in the election and so they became what they criticized\nAnd the third debate Trump said I may not accept the outcome of the election because it looked like it it's rigged however\nThe media went after him Hillary one after him Hillary said let's be clear about what are you saying and and that means he's talking down in American democracy and I'm appalled that someone is the nominee of one of the two major parties would take that position quote unquote Mallory Clinton\nBut then Trump won and Hillary never considered the election she'd never accepted the ballot box New York times never accepted the fact that Trump won\nSo they became what they criticize it was nothing but nothing short of a ... and thank you for your

to have you ever heard of China and\nSimon and his book code red about a ... vote and racial fraud in American history of the cities\nYeah I I think that there is a bind him example in the city of Cleveland there were more votes cast for Obama\nThan citizens registered in certain words and it's because the because Cleveland's in an important state my home state of Ohio I'm sure there's massive voter fraud in Chicago New York and whatever\nBut Ohio in Cleveland Columbus I Would not be surprised at all if there's hundreds or thousands of illegal votes cast because of the tabulation system and there's no check and balance because there's no Republicans in Cleveland\nWell the thing is Mr Cunningham if you're over ... code rich out of concern would be an excellent guess for your show for the new terms but here's the thing\nThe way it works with the algorithms and the machine and the companies that are for the next ... only three or four for the entire country and it's gone in the cities\nAnd what you would have is a situation where the machine has program where the Democrat has a thousand actual votes cast the Republican has an actual votes cast\nThe machine's gonna say eleven hundred for the Democrat nine hundred hundred for the Republican it's programmed in advance and the person that runs the city that Democrats in most cases\nThey're the ones that oversee the

... and a Democrat [laughter] I have indeed done to others they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh will they will try and do to us if they can the second thing is is that\nAll of our minds entirely destructive behavior\nOf attacking institutions people say people constructive in ten of these things about our society it really to me bill is nothing less than that continue some version of our nation beginning in the Nineteen twenties\nWhen the communists and their attempt to undermine us from within and I don't think we see that but I think if we do [noise] or it will provide a great context for the situation that we're in your Catholic as mine are you aware of this terrible a present state of revelations in the\nSex abusers and the official

the Communist Party starting in the Nineteen twenties late twenties and for\nTwenty years I introduced into the\nSeminary place than at the American Catholics cemeteries one thousand one hundred men

independence\nUnderstand the presumption of innocence clearly they understand due process under the law the polls showed that Democrats may they just wish to ignore it because what they want now is more important than anything\nIt is about their day to day politics\nAnd so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I Move onto goes between you you'd never happy with anything no men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks\nWell it's a couple of things the um the the whole idea\nOf of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the Web or a greater motivator for the center you know the left a you know says there are since Saturday evening\nWhile we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that\nWe'll look at early voter turnout\nAs we always do but really even with the right guy no I Know the motivation on the right there we know that so that's not going to go away or the motivation in the middle that's the question that's where you win the elections and so you look at the undecideds\nAnd how many of the key races right now are undecided or have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that group going one way or the other end turnout\nIs is is the key so beyond that the win at the highest court\nRemains to be seen because we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice ... rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench is a victory and that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey they\nJust started the process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court\nAnd if this president is still president or how that goes but ultimately now you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seen for years\nAnd so that when there is that it's an odds game as we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart and his comments\nTo us during the twenty twelve race and talking about how important the Supreme Court was\nWhen we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time for for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart censor was very clear\nAnd it is an odds game because you can support\nA John Roberts and they'll Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh and through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect\nOr if that's going to happen or for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides them and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely all agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction of some and by the way when we talked about remember what was that the\nAh was it the location device so the location of ice on the cars are about ... what was the case that everybody has a cell tower two\nWas the ... there for everybody where everybody said well we're ... the never Trump first came out and said see you didn't you say he sided with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge ...\nAnd then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court\nOr and and the Gorsuch that actually use the Scalia ruling a you know Scalia was probably the ... the the most construction as judge of of my lifetime paying attention to\nWhat the Supreme Court has a has a has has done Clarence Thomas always is not always a construction\nIs right Clarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day\nRight that's not what I'm looking for I'm never look for that I Want that's up to the legislature to decide to me there's these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the Constitution's say does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda right so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably ... or ... it was almost\nNinety nine probably Ninety nine percent just doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent Mm depending on depending on the year [laughter]\nYeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least a for me on on the ... on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare right oh huge\nAnd and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so\nI'm a again this to me was about\n\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't\nA a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you when I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party a\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party\nThought they they were uh\nI I Will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump hers\nBut to see it in action and to see them look to see the debate points that they were bringing up\nTo see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this stereotyping\nBut at the convenience all women are to believe unless you're deals those type of woman over there by the way to one of the stories of saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame\nWhite women for Kavanaugh being put in a way man I thought women were always right right and then I then they started a blaming of Eddie and the case it well wait a minute thought the woman was women\nWere always right right yeah yeah but that case had too many holes well that's the whole point that the ... the so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment\nIn order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nYes\nTheir opinions don't end their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left and them and not just the far left what you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party\nIn Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law reject a presumption of innocence and we'll slander and the pain somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting\nHe was the burning my year ah because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent bought for years and used to vote for Democrats he's sort of tell me how I can never vote for democratic at ... ever when I'm being told what white males thanks as always Ron and white men are always evil and women are always to be\nBully because everybody knows that's not true right\nFun to seven nine six four or five that's F.
