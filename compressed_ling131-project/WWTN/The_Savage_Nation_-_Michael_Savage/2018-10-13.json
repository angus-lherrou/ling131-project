Kennedy came along\nA when the media propped up at president into a celebrity they made JFK a celebrity they talked about as good looks as youth as vigorous beautiful wife his life and Camelot while ignoring his father's bootleg ing and ... he has many affairs and his horrible health problems that was probably the trial run in the media\nAre making up a celebrity of a president nobody came close\nTo being a celebrity for awhile afterwards Nixon certainly was not well liked by the party forward and had no personality Carter was bland and depressing and then along came round ...\nYou might say Ronald Reagan was the next celebrity president but you would be wrong yes he came from Hollywood and today we look back on his presidency as successful and look upon him with respect but while conservative Americans love Ronald Reagan the establishment or didn't they didn't let them at all\nAnd so here we are facing what we face today we're moving slowly but surely into a new direction right\nAnd I say to you have to look at this very carefully because presidents as celebrities are something rather new and as I said when Reagan was there a conservative Americans love the the establishment Republicans hated him and the Democrats painted Reagan is a dangerous dumped cowboy\nBut still the American people respected Reagan in ... and they did not work but they did not warship Reagan never celebrity presidents really took hold with the cult of Bill Clinton\nEven though there were many scandals white water rose law firm records allegations of sexual misconduct and write the media ignored it and create a celebrity and Bill Clinton\nScripted dances with Hillary on the beach Harvey Weinstein your knee ride Harvey Weinstein orchestrating Clinton's entrance at the convention for television consumption these were the tactics that were just being developed for the age of the celebrity president\nWhen GW Bush won they use the same tactics on him that they tried unsuccessfully to use on Reagan but this time they were successful\nFirst they said that G. W. Bush stole the election sound familiar then after being the most popular president history after nine eleven they successfully turned them into a racist the failure after Hurricane Katrina and an economic meltdown that was not if it's doing\nNow with the rise of cable news channels\nMore talk radio and more and more television programming able to pedal the ideas of a socialist ideal the media would not fail again to allow another Republican takeover so they created the ultimate celebrity president in Iraq a mama he had to look see the smile\nHe had an empty message of hope and change that they could sell even though it meant nothing and he was black\nAnd articulate Joe Biden said\nHe was articulate he was so perfect they tossed Hillary Clinton to the side and for eight years he was the perfect president\nNo scandals they said there was no fast and furious no weapons going across the border to Mexico no Irish scandal notifying reporters no ... no attacks upon the opposition no attacks on the police they cover it up for Obama and recreated Camelot\nCelebrities like Jay Z and Beyonce were paraded through the White House and the celebrity presidency took hold in America they didn't respect him or admire him they worshipped him\nBut Obama's bad policies in big media gave rise to a real celebrity president the novel Trump\nWithout to make believe perfection of Obama and Republican Party or did nothing for us from could not have a resident and we are happy he is there because he is promoting our agenda but he has continued the poison of the celebrity presidency by parading more celebrities through the White House now it's Kim and con yet\nBut what difference does the climate\nWas the hatred for Obama as bad as it is for Trump some could argue yes but what you didn't have during those years was the violence we are saying this is the new element so we've gone from celebrity worship\nRight to now motivating the worshipers into becoming a violent mob did we encourage our anti Obama people to beat up the other side to destroy property together people's faces in restaurants no we did not when Eric Holder the former chief law enforcement officer of the nation stood up before supporters\nAnd said when they go low we kick him he also said this is the new Democratic Party well is this new this is the result of a presidency that as a cult of celebrity now we're not allowed to call on the FAA a mob the word mom is not to use the cording to these new idiots this is a very dangerous place we're in now here's the main point\nA cult of celebrity has gotten our society to where it is Obama use that to his advantage to a rile up the radicals we are seeing roaming the streets now\nBecause of the celebrity of Trump Hollywood in the media have riled up these radicals to acts of violence and then there are those on our side who say President Trump can do no wrong they are the true believers this is not healthy either\nMaybe we don't need a celebrity in the White House after Donald Trump\nMaybe we do need a sober bureaucrat who makes governing about the people and the nation and not about himself or other celebrities Trump is encouraging these celebrities to run because that is the world when it comes from but Candace ... box be closed now that it's been open I'm not sure I can\nI'm Michael Savage and the author of stop mass hysteria

read what you can read yourself on on my website\nWhat I Want to go down to this he says at his best on his talk show the Savage Nation he can be a master storyteller and that voice as heavily present in this book\nMany of the essays are full of interesting angles and as he does on air Savage ranges widely and bringing in comparisons or taking a moment to dwell on a related matter\nWhile covering a lot of historical ground the book is actually fun to read it also involves a lot of storytelling told by a dentist viable engaging voice now here's what I'm getting too he writes this is my absolute favorite among the essays was the second half of chapter eleven from communist to comics\nAfter discussing the Hollywood blacklist then Joseph McCarthy and nuanced fashion\nThat conveys the genuine this of the threat but follows the threat of hysteria that eventually was used to discredit anti communism he turns to an entirely unexpected comparison the anti comic book hysteria of the Nineteen fifties\nAnd which lurid comic books were claimed to be corrupting the nation's youth leading to congressional hearings the hero of this particular tale as a man named William games with him Savage explicitly states he identifies listen to this you won't believe this\nGames came home from World war two and joined and eventually took over the business started by his father max gains\nWhom Savage jobs one of the most important man the history of popular culture games you see invented the comic book because as a printer he was bothered that the special presses used to print Sunday color comic

them out of business now it turns out that there was a happy ending to this story but I refused to ruin it if that's a reason to go out and buy stop mass hysteria you probably won't mind if you read this far Thomas thank you very much\nIt is a very beautiful review because you actually think and you could actually right very well it was Thomas would write a book anyway it's a great review and I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story but the whole comic book business was very interesting to me how it is\nAn example of mass hysteria what was done to them at that time the comic book thing

have gotten over it but I'm ...\nAnd let's say to you be careful with your worship not healthy\nYou're not supposed to worship president no matter who it is\nThat's why my monologue and the first hour so bringing it when it went over the has the most listeners it did I Know it it it's just like my book stop mass hysteria because it's not a cartoon cover of people with a a cartoon people don't want to read history you don't want to understand\nThe history of what they're living through they don't want to understand context the new ones they don't want it\nThey want black or white white or black good bad they're good they're bad where the good guys that are bad guys or do you want to hear\nSo when you were a man like me who grew up thinking about everything since he was a kid looking for answers\nWalking down the street in New York and my dad and ask them questions are not wise a sky blue I don't know what I asked the moon or to members what kids ask their fathers I always was thought to try and come up with my own answer my father wouldn't answer a question\nHe was from the old world he made me answer my question\nAnd he taught me how to think for myself\nAnd that makes me a great minority in a nation of true believers and true haters\nMost people in America today the true believers a true haters there's absolutely no in between this is the problem that I've been trying to tell you about this is why the country's falling apart this is why we're on the verge of civil war because the ... the large ... the large middle ground has been lost\nThe middle grounds God there's no middle ground in the media you see people on both sides taking a hard position one way or the other and if you don't take a hard position what happens you don't make it in the media\nYou don't make it as simple as that there's no room for the middle ground there's no room for the new ones there's no room for thought there's no room for discussion you see the lover hey that's all it is so it you know if you're a man like me to grow up thinking\nAnd now you're living in a in a ... you know in the medium of radio and a best selling author\nAnd you want to come toward a true answer a reasonable answer a rational answer or civil answer and you're living with shackles on both sides taking heart positions\nIn legion believe maybe it's time to step off the stage you get out of the spotlight I I'm telling you I'm going through a lot of soul searching right now even on the verge of a whole new career\nI'm asking myself\nIf they're going to get worse leading up to the president say forget the terms we already see what they're doing on the left egging crowds on to violence we see that already from Hillary onto a lemonade violence is good now all of a sudden the people thought their children not to hit remember just a few years ago the lives of saying oh we don't hit we don't have we don't have we know\nNow it's kicked people start a civil war anything goes because the which hasn't become president yet she thinks by whipping up the masses she's going to become president oh no the opposite is going to happen\nWhen is they're ever going to be civil living in this country I don't really know I don't think you can never ever return in in the near future\nSo having given you a nice uh nowhere introduction leading to nothing\nUh I'd say what you do open my to my\nLeft you should do open Mike and Mike eight five five four and seven to eight to because right after the show is over I'm going to just uh I'm just a big big whirlwind now with this book and\nI got a race to a TV studio get the makeup job which I hate I don't like make up even on women I like legs on my own face I Can't breathe when they put it on me I don't know and it could breathe all that stuff no wonder they can't think of television how can you might be clear of your face is covered with muck\nHow could a man thing with luck all over his face I guess in that sense I but I got a race than they were due to the Huckabee show which I Love doing because it's a great audience of country and western Christian people and they truly understand me\nSo if you want to talk about any topic go ahead [noise] it's okay\nLet me read you one Bible passages to blow out the people who hate the Bible and God and make the three people who are believers happy today because I promised you on Fridays I Would do a little did I did because I said I didn't actually I Would do Bible on friday so I got a little piece of tiny piece\nAnd I should get a passage that works for today and I can't find that\nI don't know Isaac and Abraham is Sarah I'm not interested in the Hague are the Egyptian wasn't near a drummer anger or the Egyptian I thought there was a musician and they have or the I'll give you one of the ... you'll all relate to its from genesis\nThan the lord cause the to rain than lord costs to rain upon Saddam and upon Gomorrah ... stone and fire from the lord out of having\nAnd he overthrew those cities and all the plane and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew up on the ground but his wife looked back\nFrom behind him and she became a pillar of salt that a little passage from genesis has resulted in so much great literature in so many languages ever since that one piece of genesis has been written\nThat genesis Nineteen or twenty four twenty five twenty six you you've heard ... they'll look back we will become a pillar assault you remember Bob Dylan's great song and movie don't look back\nSo many musicians I've been inspired by biblical writings and biblical ... insights we've heard about Saddam and get more we all know San Francisco as a symbol of that and it's generating by the day more and more and more you were talking about brim stone and fire\nWe don't have room store on fire a fire and bumps don't in San Francisco we have human feces and an epidemic needles but hey all is not lost without a lawyer's plastics draws you use plastic hypothermia needles to shoot yourself up and throw them in a playground but hey not a straw liberalism as a mental disorder\nAnd I cannot escape to them out unless the evil over take me and I got to behold now the city is near to the free onto any of this little one so you could say it's poetry written by ancient Israelites the ancient olive growers are the Bible\nAnd they created a religion\nEven if you don't believe in God you have to understand that [laughter] then religion of Judaism set the foundation stone for Christianity and for Islam if you don't know that into your ear and on a on a educated person\nSo this book this original book the so called Old Testament set the entire western world in motion for good and for bad\nAnd there's a lot of bad and good by the way in what came up from that\nAnd it came to pass the under two full years the pharaoh dream to behold he stood by the river but I don't know you already to do this I don't want to do it how about birds and dreams number I had a dream of out of white owl a number of years ago and I painted it you don't have an painted in about six months then about six months before the start painting\nThat shows that my ... my creativity is is going in me I don't like that my creativity is kind of dried up\nBecause I'm too driven by politics I don't want to do this anymore just politics I hate it actually I actually hate politics\nAnd trying to think back before politics was their life for me what did I Do before politics I ask myself this every day God has blessed me with good health thank God thank God I don't know what tomorrow will bring ... good health long life relative wealth\nWhat am I supposed to be doing with all of these blessings\nGetting up there every day and the microphone in talking to the people writing books for the people and being at the end of the day completely drained and exhausted with no no one bill it need to do anything after that do you understand what this takes to do and I'm not

loves my show even though he probably politically is the opposite of me but he always had an ear for talent and I would finish radio in the early days of radio I had never done anything like this and after three hours I was drained I was sweating from head to toe\nAnd I would say I am just drained the you know what he said I mean that's how it\nLearned is not in our lexicon and some are in John

go in and out with people and it's just I just lose touch with people whatever it is she writes this review where he says Michael Savage is timing could not be better in publishing his new book stopped ... of the mass hysteria okay\nTrump and he says Trump the arrangements syndrome was driven a large chunk of the meeting and tens of millions of Americans Barney and they are acting out an alarming the rest of us the very day after the book was published Eric Holder was caught on video calling for the new Democratic Party to kick opponents when they go low whipping the crowd to what you spoke into laughter and applause\nMatt Drudge caught the synchronous just again featured the books warnings of the top of his page on October limits twenty Eighteen I didn't want to thank Matt Drudge

the mobs of the nation will fall that actually that was Matt Matt Rogers headline Savage won't stop the Mavs donation will fall he summarized it better than me\nBut going back to Thomas listens review he says the average employees a broad definition of mass hysteria characterizing two complimentary aspects of it I pay thirty five mass hysteria or a massive no says is insidious in stealthy\nAnd it falls into two categories the first is positive illusions nations or hysteria when you believe something Israel absent evidence just because someone says so where it fits your preconceived notions\nThe second type is negative hallucinations or hysteria when you deny the existence of something real despite overwhelming evidence that it does exist\nOn this broad shorter Savage Rome's through our history with a series of highly entertaining essays on incidence of mass hysteria and then he summarizes them\nAnd I'm not going to read what you can read yourself on on my website\nWhat I Want to go down to this he says at his best on his talk show the Savage Nation he can be a master storyteller and that voice as heavily present in this book\nMany of the essays are full of interesting angles and as he does on air Savage ranges widely and bringing in comparisons or taking a moment to dwell on a related matter\nWhile covering a lot of historical ground the book is actually fun to read\nIt also involves a lot of storytelling told by an identifiable engaging voice now here's what I'm getting too he writes this my absolute favorite among the essays was the second half of chapter eleven from communist the comics\nAfter discussing the Hollywood blacklist than Joseph McCarthy and I knew once fashion\nThat conveys the genuine this of the threat but follows the threat of hysteria that eventually was used to discredit anti communism he turns to an entirely unexpected comparison the anti comic book hysteria of the Nineteen fifties in which lurid comic books were claimed to be corrupting the nation's youth\nLeading to congressional hearings the hero of this particular tale as a man named William games with him Savage explicitly states she identifies listen to this you won't believe this\nGames came home from World war two and joined and eventually took over the business started by his father max gangs\nWho Savage jobs one of the most important men in the history of popular culture games you see invented the comic book because as a printer he was bothered that the special presses use to print Sunday color comic sections for newspapers sat idle most of the week\nHe first reprint that's on Sunday comic strips into book form staple them together and then moved on to original contact content when ... died in the boating accident in Nineteen forty seven his son William took over the business among dispersed titles was tales from the crypt\nFollowing the publication of a best selling book by a psychologist subduction oh the innocent Saturday ...\nScheduled hearings of a Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency and drag games before it and her rank them ... went on to a greater prominence nagging the vice presidential nomination of Democrats in Nineteen fifty six would at least they would sit at the top of the ticket\nThey lost ... lost everything the backlash against comics drove him out of business now it turns out that there was a happy ending to this story but I refused to ruin it if that's the reason to go out and buy stop mass hysteria you probably won't mind if you read this far Thomas thank you very much\nIt is a very beautiful review because you actually think and you could actually right very well it was Thomas would write a book anyway it's a great review and I'm not going to tell you the rest of the story but the whole comic book business was very interesting to me how it is an example of mass hysteria\nWhat was done to them at that time the comic book thing so I don't know I could ask you to comment that I can play some sound I don't know what ... saying on merit just fine\nShy play that or um what's his name that as getting a lot of playing Don lemonade if ... if you have a lemon ... if you find yourself with a lemon making lemonade Don lemonade\nHe's a loser on lemonade as I said you many times before he became a prominent moron before he was an uh an unknown more and now he's a prominent moron Don lemonade again if you go into a light bulb store let's say Home Depot\nAnd you buy a boat for a lay up you've got a hundred a hundred and a quarter an eighty water uh Seventy seven water they make a forty water than there were a utility bulbs the little ones that you're putting the back of a refrigerator stove\nEven the media Don lemonade is like a utility ball in terms of intelligence and brightness so now he's making a name for himself and becoming a vial idiot that so what more do I have to say about it more\nNothing more needs to be said oh here's a nice one this is a good day for it the way I'm feeling\nCan us reveals pointless iPhone co during White House meeting why he would have a deranged dirty mouth\nIndividual like this at the resolution desk is so heartbreaking it's unbelievable to me\nI tell you the truth I think this advice is not coming from the president I can pretty much tell you I Know who advised this but I'm not going to do it at the risk of alienating even more people in the inner circle this was the worst public relations disaster for Trump with his base I've ever seen\nAnd it's a result of Fox News taking over the the West Wing it is is that you remember how he criticized the coziness between Bill Clinton and the media member how he criticized Obama and the friendliness of the media and we were right to do so when the media becomes owned by a\nPresident it's not a reliable source\nAnd what you see\nEvery day a shout out to another Fox News host as good as they may be there's something very inappropriate about this cozy

it in perspective and talking about it [laughter] we're taught Ninety nine seven double duty as the weather's traffic and taught I appeared on Newsmax\nTV you go to TV station these days it's the alternative conservative television station it's a great station Newsmax TV and I highly recommend\nIt will they interviewed me this week I Want you to listen for a few minutes and tell me what you think\nAbout that I thought for you\nAsk me questions I'll tell you know after after what we just went through with cabin or could there be a better a book coming out at this time I mean you talk about mass hysteria\nI have not seen anything like this historically since I Would say the Dreyfus affair and France where a Jewish French military officer was unfairly accused of being a a traitor\nBy French anti Semite they planted evidence that was not real sound like Dr fraud doesn't it\nAgainst Kavanaugh and he was he was sent the devils island you may remember ... remember the movie with Dustin Hoffman a devil's island movie escape from that but whatever it was the fact of the matter is it took a hundred years to exonerate ... and ... was never a spy for Germany would they just did that Kavanaugh\nIs exactly akin to what they did to Louis Dreyfus in France the framing but this was a public execution ... orchestrated by Dianne Feinstein and our pal of gangsters\nFor the whole world to see and the only question that we have today is will this have an effect in the mid term elections meaning we'll enough women who came out for Trump realize\nWhether they're Republican or Democrat or independent they have sons brothers and her husband's uncles\nThere are males and families even feminists have males and their families would you believe that they weren't made in test tubes well except in San Francisco part [laughter] their father was a turkey based or in San Francisco so I guess it doesn't apply here\nIn all seriousness though if we don't stop the guillotine of hatred\nBeing dropped by the left their own heads are going to be cut off back and and the guillotine is a very thirsty instrument and as the French Revolution taught the world after they killed over the counter revolutionaries they didn't stop killing than the revolutionaries turned on each other for a power in a power struggle\nAnd this is what went on and Castro's Cuba poll pots Cambodia mouse China or the Bolshevik Revolution and what we're seeing now in America is exactly again in my opinion to what went on and all these revolutions in the early days that's a capital was a symbol of everything they hate\nOr what is it that they hate the left let's check off the boxes together he's a male jak\nHe's white check he's at or a sexual ... three he's married count for a way he's also a Republican count five ... so unless the person is the opposite of that the left will destroy them politically they insane\nRight that might have had I gone down there than my my background\nI you may know and and mental health and psychology and and the question I get from the audience that's when I think around the country and why are American so easily do ... I Believe all the things we all know is still alive than Americans tend to believe\nBecause the media is Ninety nine point ... percent controlled by the radical left a you how many Newsmax TVs are there how many Newsmax websites are there it's infinitesimal small look at all the major media they're all left wing and they're all\nTrying to appeal to the lowest common denominator amongst they're listening to ship you know something occurred to me in in in in writing mass hysteria\nYeah there's a thing called groupthink which we're all familiar with ... and people tend to repeat what they hear others are saying in order to be approved by the group and it's very hard to be an outlier let's say you live in a liberal community you go to a liberal college right\nYou can't say that you approve of Columbus Day you'll be castigated ... and so you don't say no Columbus was a terrible person\nOr I Would in a bar last night to have a beer in a little town here in northern California I just wanted to be alone had my beers bar tend to look typical millennial early thirties kind of guy you know straw hat beyond the Barney sounded talk to me that know me obviously said\nWell I sort of slow to that he said well it's a holiday weekend you know Columbus Day but I don't celebrate it\nSo I said why not use them I don't like what he did\nI said well you wouldn't be here of Columbus had done what he did\nYou see I guess you're right it wouldn't be here I said you have any children\nIs I'm a seven year old he said I guess my child wouldn't be here was a guy with only one statement for me without anger he came to realize that Columbus\nDiscovered America mhm so now you want to wipe out this great amazing sea voyage of discovery because it's not politically attuned with at times but the main thing I said to him was\nCan you name one country on earth that was not founded and blood and conquest and he said no I should say why single out our own country as being worse than the others that was the point I'm trying to make\nNow why have we vilified our own nation as being worse than any nation on earth ... and it's all connected to mass hysteria and group think\nWhich I carefully\nKind of uncomfortable here and in my book stop mass hysteria and I I Want to say one thing to uh to go into the book for one minute we don't have much time and people are great\nAnd having me on I've written political books and they've done very well in this book I Try to bridge politics with history and and I found out that a little history goes a long way such as saying that this bartender can you name one country on earth that was not founded and blood and conquest\nAnd it's instantaneous the answer say no I really can't and in doing that by learning a few things you can probably turn arguments with rational people now that's a big ... rational people\nWrite that down and that that guy there are some might only asking you so you engage with your audience what are your caller is telling you about the deep divide between themselves your callers that they're conservative what are they telling you about that divide between themselves and their neighbors who might be ideologically opposed to them\n[laughter] you can't you see here's the problem I think the battle lines are drawn as a I have said before and unfortunately I see happening ... years ago wrote a book or stop becoming civil war now this is becoming sort of a common thing like all we're having another civil war you know\nUh I think the battle lines are drawn the Mason Dixon Line is very clear people on both sides families are divided just like before the civil war and we'll we're waiting for a Fort Sumter and I think Dianne Feinstein was a living embodiment I'm a Fort Sumter with a lipstick", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "13"}
