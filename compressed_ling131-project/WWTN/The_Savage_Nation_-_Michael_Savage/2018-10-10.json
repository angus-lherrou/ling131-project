through the book stop mass hysteria that's why they're not running it on Fox News because there's no connection to the news is that there's a connection to a cookbook or to a cartoon book but nevertheless we plod along doing the best we can\nI Am like Donald Trump during the campaign when they said he couldn't win a and it's up to us to whether or not the message when just that simple now I realize many of you are sick and tired of hearing me talk about my book I understand that but let me ask you something\nI Want to ask you a sincere question have you heard about my book on the other is themes conservative shows\nHave you ever heard in ... about Michael Savage on Fox News or any of the other so called conservative stars no you haven't so I'm Alone you're alone but the message is really most important today because unless we stop the mass hysteria\nYou will see a disaster in this nation unlike any we have seen in modern history there gunning for us\nI saw an article yesterday in Oregon\nAnd I put it on Michael Savage dot com it's a fourth down I Believe\nAnd it's shocking it's a video\nOf Soros funded anti ... took over the streets of Portland, Oregon\nDirecting traffic blocking cars threatening people didn't obey calling anyone white a Ku Klux Klan member or a white supremacist you add militant disgusting so called feminists you had anti whites in the streets directing cars and the way that gets worse\nA Portland policemen on a motorcycle sat there and did nothing\nAnd I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the ... that is raining in San Francisco\nAnd in Portland and in Seattle and an other depositions of extreme left as that is spreading like a cancer because of a mass hysteria where they think anyone or they've been told that anyone who opposes the communist agenda is white supremacist\nWhat they don't understand what I Do understand is that this is a civil war that has been fueled for a number of years by Nancy Pelosi who at UC Berkeley that's the University of California at Berkeley thank you\nAre in a commencement speech three years ago said we are all the structures she encouraged people to go in the streets in cause chaos\nTo block traffic what does she think what happened or by Maxine Waters who should be in jail for what she's doing\nA encouraging leftist fanatics like those and on the five to beat up Republicans harassed Republicans a drive them out of restaurants I refuse to live in fear that I Will not cower myself I'm a public figure\nI perhaps the most prominent member of the opposition in the San Francisco area I Will not cower to these people I Will protect myself at all times I'm an old boy scout I remember the boy scout motto I Will protect myself at all times and if I feel threatened\nI Will react accordingly I Will not be driven out of my own city of my own home and I hope you feel the same way what began with Trump witch hunt\nHas now spread to anyone they disagree with\nSo of course there's no ties to the news\nYou won't see any mention of stop mass hysteria on Fox News because it really isn't news hysteria there is no hysteria and the air what you saw against Kavanaugh that wasn't a a result of mass hysteria there was a witch hunt against cabin or he wasn't a pa not up for all white\nMale heterosexual Christians washy of course he was\nWell that's the fact of the matter is we're living in very historical times and very dangerously hysterical times and the purpose of my book is not for me to buy a new car or a new house I have a new car and too many houses\nNo what I'm trying to do here is save America before it's too late and so I'm asking you to Savage army\nTo help me and that means have you gone to your local bookstore to look for the book\nWere ... were was the book where it's supposed to be I have a list of where it's supposed to be\nIn Walmart and Sam's it's in bestsellers and I heard this there\nAt the books and millions on making news table I heard it's there but I'm getting mixed answers from Barnes and noble it's a purchase to be on the new released table between the ninth of October which is today and the twenty second of October which is not today and I have gotten one picture after another of\nThe book not being on a new release table or buried underneath other books on a new release table so it's up to you to go there and demanded the book the put where the publisher of paid for it to be put because it's probably the most important book of our time in fact I Would say can you tell me of a of a more important book\nTell me what book tell me which book is more important right now because I don't know of one and so what happened when you went into the bookstores and what are you going to do with the book many of you are buying the book for yourself and friends to try to have a dialogue with them\nAnd that's the main thing can you buy one for your liberal neighbor to read will they even read a book you know I Am pretty active on Twitter since Trump started trading at first I thought it was for children only but I realized that there are many people who do turn to these\nOutlets for their opinions and for their for to to debate people so I put some stuff up\nAnd one of them was do you think\nFox News has blacklisted Michael Savage\nAnd why well I Know why\nAnd then I make another statement as the only major conservative TV outlet Fox News is like a public utility and yet they engage in the same censorship as Twitter and Facebook now how's that for turnabout we've been hearing that Twitter\nIs engaging in censorship that Facebook is engaging in censorship and we've said no that's not fair even though they're private enterprises and the argument we abuses that they're so big that they are like public utilities or shutting the same reasoning apply to Fox News\nThey are the only conservative TV outlet and yet they're blacklisting some people myself included should they be allowed to do it now don't give me the garbage about that there are private enterprise you can do what they want that will be true if there were three of four conservative TV outlets but there aren't there is only one\nSo they're doing the same thing as Twitter and Facebook and getting away with it because we haven't thought through\nAnd that's the opening to the program judicious timing Michael Savage a new book mass hysteria by are more of world net daily I suggest you go and look at it it's a great article by art\nAnd another one came out from the times of Israel which again you'll only find linked on a Michael Savage dot com apparently uh the times of Israel world that daily Breitbart News is no longer good enough for anyone in the conservative media\nThey banished me Breitbart world that Daily Times of Israel all normally linked by those in the media are suddenly blacklisting them as well well\nYou have an option you can read these things thank God Newsmax is still out there they had me on Newsmax TV and my friend Chris Reddy as not stab me in the back thank you Christopher standing by me a in a critical time in American history\nAnd if you want to see the Newsmax TV ah interview I linked it up on Michael Savage dot com and I suspect there'll be more\nOf this to come let's go to the callers on the Savage Nation chaos info Steve line one what's on your mind\nYes I went to Barnes and noble and Alfred oh your book was not even out anywhere so the lady went to the back room to retrieve it for me [noise]\nIsn't that nice well Serino for those who don't know it is in the area known as the East Bay of San Francisco which is the harbinger of the most left wing fanatics and the country this sister to Oakland, California to give them some idea where it is [noise] uh and and who was the lady\nWas she wanted these wonderful feminists or she normal normal human being\nThe same normal um no problem with her going back to get the ... it's just the fact that it was an out anywhere and I searched and searched and fell I finally went to go forever and ah\nHe well right well I'm thanking you for being part of the Savage army because his average army certainly needs you

there is in the bay area of San Francisco right now she said people are more afraid to express themselves here in the San Francisco area than they were in my communist nation of Hungary before the

Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those people in the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed them and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I'd learned today that Governor Huckabee\nAnd his show has one of the most loyal and phenomenally large audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News if not more so in its own time slot wherever it is seen\nNow last year Governor Huckabee was kind enough to have me on a show at the grand old Opry houses where it was broadcast for God's sake and reason in the book took off like a rocket after that\nAnd I'm going to be on Governor Huckabee show this Friday I've invited ... the governor onto the show to be with us today and I just got an email it can't joined me

wag the dog for so many years as suddenly the dog said look enough is enough we don't want the tail wagging us you'd be an angry tail wouldn't you or am I speaking an allegory is that are too complex for the average Fox News view or perhaps I Am\nNo there's no news in the stop mass hysteria people in the media saying well we're not covering it because there's no hysteria out there is no news handle okay so I'll ask my audience is there anyone else\nAnd who can see a news angle to stop mass hysteria there's the books just launched today it's not going anywhere except the up it's not going to go down I've taken\nYou want an unprecedented Journey Through the long history of mass hysteria in the United states from Columbus to the Salem witch trials and the so called red scares in the Nineteen thirties and forties and I every counted them many times collective insanity of prompted by sinister politicians were they'll tear your motors has gripped the American public\nBut what about now what is going on in our world today that would indicate a form of mass hysteria I think it's pretty easy to put\nIt together uh and I'd like your calls at eight\nFive five four hundred seven to eight to eight five five four hundred Savage WABC rich thanks for calling rich what's your topic please\nMr Savage the resignation [noise] go ahead [noise] um I think it would be pretty much journalistic negligence not to mention the fact that she sent her letter only one week after Trump made in our thing address to the un\nSlow down I don't know what you're connected what what embarrassing address you're talking about are you talking about when Trump's at America's great again and we've done great things that to you is embarrassing\nNo no they didn't say that he said my administration has done more than any previous administration which everybody laughed at and rightfully should\n... ... what are you saying I don't understand that you have to understand that America is now looked upon by the rest of the world in a new light and it's a positive light\nAnd that's why everyone's laughing\nYou see again you only heard what you wanted to hear I listen to that speech they truck old when he said that in the beginning because they were laughing with him and then he moved in to talk to them I'll play it for you if you want and you can listen to it again they actually sharing them right after that\n\nWhat what did you only hear the soundbite from Jake Tapper is that where you got it from from the did you did you listen to it on the on the on the Pew better known as the view I closed appeal because it stinks I mean that we are is that what you heard your soundbite from the view or from a er Jake Tapper\nWhereas the I don't know where he went are have a nice day let's get the soundbite if you can in the shower [noise] of the actual speech at the un where Trump\nMakes what the left thinks is a fellow part of the world laughs at them and listen to the entire context of them not laughing at them that's what I heard by the way\nOkay what do you think about Haley's resignation do you agree with me that she resigned because she failed to ignite war with Russia She was put there specifically to ignite meaning to drag the U.S military and to attack Syria and Russia look it's a very complicated game the middle east\nAnd you have to have a mind as complex as mine to even understand that otherwise you could just sit here and salute and say she was great because she's on our side that's the easy thing to do she was a disaster and the reason she's out is because she didn't she did not\nSucceed at what she was put there to do which was to ignite a war that would've dragged us aircraft if not troops into Syria forever that's what she wanted to do and that was so that there would be a buffer between Iran\nAnd the other forces that are aligned against Israel and I can't blame Israel for that not at all\nI mean if you're Israel and you're a little nation surrounded by enemies of course you want to do what you can to defend your own people\nBut I Would say that America First means America First not America second for any reason that's my point of view and I'm a devout Zionist that have been some twelve years old and a great supporter of Israel but you know what Israel has the most powerful military in the middle east is time they use that\nInstead of using a uncle Joe you know I'm sick and tired of America dying for other other people's wars and I'm not alone in that that is why Trump was elected he was elected to keep us out of foreign wars not bring us into them\nBut I guess you will forgot that\nAnd a on a personal note well you know the Trump is surrounded by several factions as are all presidents\nOne of the factions are global lists like Nikki Haley like moustache Leo\nAnd then there are other factions who are nationalist and they vie with each other for the president's attention and then he makes the decisions obviously that's why he's the chief executive\nWell he didn't listen to the global is who wanted him to launch Tomahawk strike against Syria four weeks ago Haley was literally ruling\nDrew when she was on the verge of success our greatest success ever of igniting a war and it made no sense to me\nNone whatsoever\n[noise] ISIS had been beaten back into one city ... whatever it is and Russia and thank God for Russia and Syria and our own warplanes ISIS was beaten back into this one city\nAnd in order to make sure that the Syrians and Russians didn't go in to clean out the remaining elements of ISIS in that city\nThere were talks that Saddam was going to unleash chemical weapons on\nHis own people which made no sense whatsoever none\nI mean you're winning a war the whole world is watching everyone as an iPhone you can unleash poison gas on your own women and children who would do that who wouldn't believe a story like that other than idiots who would buy a story like that and I kept saying this weeks and weeks ago don't do it don't do it don't do it\nI said message after a message to the White House whether they were receiving them or not I don't know I I Know they received them\nAnd they know one thing about the Savage Nation so long as I'm Still here as long as I still have a loyal audience which I Do you are the base that elected Donald Trump not the Johnny come lightly none of them elected Donald Trump you did\nAnd now that I said that I'm going to say something else so it's not lost the historic\n\nWhatever I decide to do come January whatever that may be whether it's what's announced or something else\nI Will rest knowing and my family knows and they're pretty bright people that it was a guy who helped push Donald Trump into the public eye and pushed them over the finish line he even said the same thing to me put his arm around me and said without this man I wouldn't be president I Am proud to tell you that I have saved the western world\nFrom the total insanity that they were and still are engaged and that is how I see it and then as how that is how my Britain family sees it and I don't need the approval of anyone else in the media I Know what's right I Know what's true and I want to thank God for giving me the power to have help move\nThe west to save itself before it's too late but the game is really not over\nIt's only just begun you've got a few nationalist movements in Europe that are trying to wrestle with their own survival being fought by the international is the communist the socialist the George Soros funded suicidal brigades just as we do here\nAnd the battle is still being fought everywhere in every outlet in this world in the west that we know of it\nThe battle for the soul of the west is being fought on a daily basis that's a form of the mass hysteria I deeply describing my new book now I admit that maybe it's too much information for the average Rush Limbaugh listener\nI don't call myself el Savage Joe or the great one I don't need to do that I Need you to understand the bigger picture\nI live in a medium called radio that is what it is I Love and I've been with it for twenty five years and I will tell you that it's very easy to fall back into\nThe tropes of left and right and just go along with the herd in order to be heard but I'm not going to go along with the her just to be hurt I Am

you want to repeat the history of the Bolshevik Revolution\nOr of the revolutions in other countries that led to the deaths of millions go ahead be my guess I Would like to reference an article written by Cindy gross in the times of Israel I'm going to read you a few paragraphs and I'll Try to stay away from\nThe obvious she says\nSavage is the host of one of the most countries most streamlined radio shows but Michael Savage also fortune teller a brilliant wanted that who else of Michael Savage would release a book on October ninth the first day of work for associate justice Brett Kavanaugh after three weeks of historic hysteria embarrassed our country internationally\nI spoke with Savage and he said the left is not just take President Trump they hate this nation is nothing new but it's at its worst\nAnd then she says Savage delves into American history history of mass hysteria to approve it from Christopher Columbus the Salem witch trials and then he or she she quotes me and she says that these are being set in motion by sentence the politicians without Syria motives\nSavage provides vital contacts for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks a mass hysteria their causes they're short and long term effects\nThe tactics of the puppet masters who duped gullible masses interfering threats both real and imagine she then went into the issue of Jews because she writes for the times or Israel she's very Jewish and she asked me a key question which\nWas funny which was is this good or bad for the Jews what is being done to Capitol at that time\nAnd Savage said quote when Jews are good they are great but when they're bad they're very dangerous\nSavage pointed out adding quote the smartest yet most dangerous person today is Bernie Sanders he is so smart he knows exactly what he is doing he models this platform from the power madness of the Bolshevik Revolution he is energizing this frenzy among the young ...\nOf course we discussed the cabin on stereos\nAnd he said the check off to smear Kavanaugh was challenged in last male white heterosexual married in Christian the involvement of a Feinstein who was not Jewish Blumenthal or Schumer affects Jews long term\nWe compared how Jews were treated during the alpha Dreyfuss earlier Frank cases\nSavage also related how Jewish laws and ethics are the exact opposite of what took place during the process of confirming Cavanaugh I thought that was the most salient points of our interview Savage related how the Jewish laws an ethics are the exact opposite of what took place\nDuring the process of governing Kavanaugh\nWhat was sad about it was that there were Jewish people violating the ethics of their fathers Blumenthal amongst them bloom and throwing others amongst them using the exact opposite of the teaching of the Jewish people\nSavage a Trump supporter agrees that while he doesn't agree with Trump one hundred percent he thanks got every day to Hillary isn't in the White House to any critics Savage says nobody agrees with a spouse or friend one hundred percent\nAnd then he went on with other stuff Savage encourages opposition to read the book and debate him\nAnd of course my discussion was Savage included where to get some good food the Catskill Mountains and as involvement with about so there was a very good interview and I ... and it's worth reading by people who are interested in the deeper ramifications of what happened and how the effects of going to be seen for years and years to come\nSo many different topics there's an article a Web traffic race CNN beats Fox News can you believe that drudge beats the New York times and the Washington Post these and independent and guess what dominates porn sites porn sites of dominating Web traffic\nNow you could argue that's part of the free free market or you could argue that same nation would not permit this any longer\nThat things would be done because they're destroying an entire generation forget older people\nI'm Talking about children who you know and I know are being forever warped I Am talking about couples are in couples therapy because they can no longer have normal sex because the

goes along with it and she feels no kind of activity what the man she does adjusts to please them and to have a little sex but it's not what she wants which is she wants to love\nAnd as a result the

Francisco right now she said people are more afraid to express themselves here in the San Francisco area than they were in my communist nation of Hungary before the wall fell I was actually done by that observation\nWe have now the Senate to the point of absolute in total fear because the leftist have taken over\nOur minds let alone our politics\nAnd this is something that you have to come to understand you you for example listening to the show many of your rely upon me because I'm sort of your statue of liberty\nIn many ways I express what you would like to express and are afraid to express let me tell you something you're actually a prisoner you're more of a president of the people lived under the Soviet red\nScare\nYou're more of a prisoner then people lived in Russia\nDuring

you may know the show is moving to only a one hour show in January and apart cashed do you think that that's because of not because of political considerations I was taken off major stations a year or two ago even though I had very high ratings\nThere are other people who oppose us quote conservatives but they're not a threat to the establishment\nThey're very safe conservatives it's easy to call yourself conservative and not be a threat to the establishment is another thing to be an independent who is a threat to the establishment both left and right there's no room in America for the independent minded individual let me tell you that right now almost no room whatsoever none whatsoever\nYou got to play the game according to the rules and the rules say you joined one party or the other it's an interesting that so many people who put Trump down for years straight back to other candidates ridiculed you are now making believe that they're the greatest supporter of Donald Trump well he's not fooled by it\nAnd I'm not fooled by it but let's get back to the news of the day and my opinion on it I don't know whether you agree or disagree with me I said that Haley resigned suddenly because she failed to ignite a war with Russia and failed to get Trump to bomb Syria now\nWhat do I base my opinion she was bellicose from the beginning she was bombastic and bellicose at the same time and very threatening she was the exact opposite of what an ... supposed to be an ambassador is supposed to make peace not war Haley went in there with one mission which was to cause dissension with Russia\nThrough Syria and by bombing Syria again based on the false flag of a chemical attack\nWhich I kept pointing out over and over again it's a false flag false flag false flag false flag there were about to release gas and say that I saw that it I pointed out over and over again Assad would be an insane individualized would put in to do this when they're\nWhen they've got ISIS back in a corner in one city they wouldn't do it and somehow people within the Trump Administration\nHeard this viewpoint and decided not to unleash another Tomahawk missile attack on the Syrians even though they were ready to do so they were on the verge four weeks ago I don't know if you remember and who was beating the drum for the launch of Tomahawk so against Syria\nWell it was miss the most jazz trio himself\nThe man who gave us the Iraq War the most dangerous man in the administration is that and the ... plant in the national security advisor ship position and Nikki Haley the two of them wanted war in the worst way they were bloodthirsty and they wanted war\nBut for some reason the non global is around from war of the winners and they prevented them from launching against Syria and from provoking a war with Russia which is a fantastic well\nAs a result Haley's resigning that's my opinion maybe disagree with me and I don't know on what basis you would disagree with me and then we're talking about my book stop mass hysteria what you found in the book stores or\nA more intelligent level if you've gotten the book through Amazon in advance and you've read some of it what are the best things in it\nSo here we are on the day of the launch of the book and you're not seeing it anywhere in the media because of the blacklisting of Fox News which has now spread to virtually everywhere but there's some some great news on the horizon the you and for me for that matter\nGovernor Huckabee has his own show\nAnd it was left off last year by those people in uh the cable world certainly Fox News dismissed them and left them off they thought he'd be marginal I've learned today that Governor Huckabee\nAnd his show has one of the most loyal and phenomenally larger audiences amongst country and western Christian people\nAnd it's become as important as Fox News if not more so in its own time slot wherever it is seen", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael
