I. L. A.\nThe public interest legal foundation says this is how the Texas Democratic party is inviting foreign influence\nAn election and the federal election cycle the Texas secretary of state's office said it too had gotten complaints from both immigrant scam from relatives of dead people who said they got mailings asking them to register Texas Governor Greg Abbott vowed to investigate he says if true\nThere will be serious consequences\nSo now we have a Russian woman charged with meddling in the election not twenty sixteen\nTwenty eight team a Russian woman today has been charged with interfering in American elections including next month's midterms through a vast social media effort aimed at trying to sway American public opinions\nThis according to the Associated Press it's believed to be the first federal case alleging Russian interference in this year's elections and remember what they've been saying to\nCurse than a a Nielsen da chess secretary has said that the Chinese are trying to influence the election to who do you think they're trying to influence there trying to influence people to vote against the Republicans of course of course\nJustice Department disclose the criminal complaint soon after U.S intelligence agencies setting a joint statement that they were concerned about efforts by Russia China and Iran to influence us voters and policy this complaint says the woman Alina alec said no\nCushion nova worked for the same Russians social media troll farm\nThat was indicted in February by Robert Mueller the complaint accuses her of helping to control the finances of a Russian effort to use fake social media postings just so anger and division among American voters now what they're doing in many cases is it taking both sides of the issue\nSo why are they doing this I've done a lot of studying on it I've done a lot of studying on this issue and it\nSeems to me that the Russians are trying to\nDiminish our influence in Europe\nAnd if they can so discontent amongst us and create chaos in America it takes our eye off the ball about what they're trying to do in the European Union which is to control those folks with oil and gas and everything else they want to do and have their way with the European Union\nYou know they've already made deals with Russia side deals with not even supposed to be making NATO countries are not supposed to be doing that but they're doing it any way same thing with Iran we're trying to keep people from dealing with Iran they're going to deal with Iran anyway in Iran China and Russia are trying to screw with our elections again\nAnd we'll see what happens we'll see what happens\nEarlier the AP reported that um\nThe U.S intelligence officials say they're concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia China in Iran but here's the interesting thing to their only focusing on Russia you know why because of the Mueller investigation and the\nI guess the insinuation is is if that Russia's meddling is bound to be involving Trump and they're involved in meddling in the elections to its Russia it's China and its Iran\nAnd they don't say who's the bigger culprit but I can almost guarantee you're China's the biggest culprit but they don't emphasize that they mentioned it several paragraphs down\nIn a joint statement the office of the director of national intelligence the homeland security department the Justice Department or the FBI said they're worried about activities that seek to influence voter perceptions and decision making and the twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty elections\nThe agency the ongoing campaigns could take many forms examples include attempts to influence voters through social media sponsoring content an English language media such as Russian outlets are tea\nOr feeding this information through sympathetic spokespersons regarding political candidates in disseminating foreign propaganda\nIntelligence official said last year than Russia sought to influence the twenty sixth in presidential election through similar means what they don't tell you is it they were going on both sides you had pro burning stuff anti Bernie stuff pro Hillary stuff anti Hillary stuff pro Trump stuff anti Trump stuff\nAnytime there's black lives matter involved in something with the police there in the middle of that too on social media anytime there's a secession movement in California or Texas they're on both sides of that any when they can drive a wedge between America and that's what they're doing\nAnd the idea is to get us at each other's throats so that we take the eye off the ball on foreign matters they're trying to have their way around the world and they think that if they make us totally discombobulated over here in the United states that we will be weakened\nSo this is a concerted effort on the part of China or Iran and Russia to just screw with us\nAnd if anybody doesn't see this by now this is not Trump and Russia conspiring to win an election this is Russia they don't care who wins what I say they don't care who wins I think they would rather not have trumping there certainly after you've gotten in\nA but they want to so discontent they want us at each other's throats and it's working you look around the country we're at each other's throats about all sorts of stuff\nAnd a lot of stuff that really doesn't matter you don't think that they're involved in all these mob protest and things like this of course they are we found out during twenty sixteen there was an anti Trump rally\nThat was sponsored as we found out later by some Russian troll group on Facebook and they weren't even at the rally they just encourage other people to show up so people showed up anti Trump votes waving signs written in screaming and having a big time\nThis is what they do so this is just the latest example and it's not just Russia folks Russia Iran and China QuickTime organism your phone calls in a moment one eight hundred six

we're just talking about Iran China\nAnd Russia are trying to influence the midterm elections easy to chat with his about Iranian oil headed for China and he's on the line with us which when they're younger Richard how are you\nDoing great how are you I'm doing very well\nSo it's ironic that we have this Russian woman arrested today\nShe's part of this trolling social media operation where they're trying to influence the midterm elections and beyond the AP story of course doesn't tell you that they're trying to influence both sides are trying to get to all of us will be others throats as they didn't twenty sixteen but they also mentioned later on in the article\nThat they also know that China in Iran are trying to influence and you're going to tell us about Iranian oil heading for China I think it was rather ironic in light of what we know today\nWell that's the way we know that Iran like Russia and China or one of the most threatening cyber actors out there right now trying to attack us or in the cyber realm and also influence our election\nOr they have reason to because the sanctions that President Trump has reimpose comeback or fall back on November ... and the Iranian economy has already shrinking ah the IMF is warning that we're going to look at a recession in Iran\nOf the expansion during the Obama era Iran nuclear deal\nBut so the Iranian regime right now is looking for ways to evade that pressure uh it's gotta be hard for them to to to find ways to do that one of them\nAre we just learned about is trying to uh send ships with their oil out to various parts of the world including China hoping that the ap that the sanctions are in effect they'll they'll be able to sell their oil on the black market\nSo are they not going to be selling it directly to China as we speak or or or what's going on with it I mean if it is it's a matter of they're going to wait for the sanctions to be lifted are they going to go ahead and defied the sanctions\n[noise] yeah so it's important to kind of take a step back first does understand where we're at a back in may before President Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal that sanctions ran a comeback in six months\nThe Iranians were exporting about two and a half million barrels per day of oil to the world a record high since well before the Iran nuclear deal a ticket affected before the sanctions come into play a under their ...\nAnd so what we saw over the last six months a steady decline as countries prepare for sanctions come back\nAnd we believe that uh after November says that number of on their exports could fall too between one million and one and a half million barrels per day so taking a million or perhaps a million and a half miles per day of Iranian exports off the market a massive impact to Iran under the sanctions after November fifth\nIf you're a country that has received a waiver from the United states to continue exporting importing rather\nIranian oil because you have significantly reduced then you can continue to do that but if you have not received one of those waivers any bank that process the transaction is subject to sanctions and so what I think the Iranians are doing\nRight now is they're preparing for a couple of scenarios one because so much of their oil it's coming off the market so fast they're afraid they may have to shut down production wells and they don't want to do that because of the domestic impact that would have\nSaid they're trying to just keep flooding the market even if it's just on floating storage on big ships sitting in the middle of the Indian Ocean and\nSecond if they have oil in places that we may not know about\nA it becomes harder for us to detect when they might flip out the shipping label on some of these\nAh boxes and some of these tankers and so that suddenly you might think that you are buying oil that came from Iraq or or came from Saudi Arabia or came from somewhere else even though the actual original contacts were around him\nSo is it seemed to saying that some of these folks are actually getting the oil may not know where it's coming from or they they complicit in all this and they know about the label switching before it gets to them there are black\nOr to fill the vacuum a and so I I don't think we'll see that right now we've seen oil actually come down over last week or we're now basically where we were a month ago on the oil markets\nAnd so I'm unless we do something drastic ah to Saudi Arabia to impact their oil supply or one would think that we're we're very much in in the realm of eighty dollar a created at this point on on the front\nAnd I hate to think of it being political but everything's political it would to me um unimaginable to Trump will do anything about Saudi Arabia before November six because that may have some kind of impact on the oil prices so we're probably going to see all of this taking care of after the midterm elections running\n[noise] yeah I think that you'd have to pay out at the world bully get some sort of answers this week maybe even today or tomorrow I'm I think that they're on a timeline or that is presumably separate from politics\nUh but uh you know the timing may work out that that's something does happen after the terms of just because that's how the investigation holds up\nAn interesting Richard Goldberg with the

do\nCall me an anti Semite stomach I'm anti termites so he was referring to the uses termites\nFacebook representative informed the ramp is Eric ... comments were or what\nThey called tier one hate

Twitter now has not taken down the tweet nor has its suspended pheromones account they did this to of course Alex\nDrones anytime he was doing what they perceived to be hate speech that closes accounts kicked him off Twitter\nTwitter told buzzfeed this was on Wednesday the tweet did not violated the humanizing speech policy because it's not yet been implemented [laughter] we have this nice humanizing speech policy but it's not official yet\nSo I Wonder you know this retroactive\nWhen you have a ... speech policy and it's in place then go back to ... speech and say hey we're gonna have to take this thing down you know what Facebook is already doing this but there are only doing this because they've been pressured to do it they see all this stuff they get the complaints and then they don't act on it\nBut this actually you know this video a clip of course is is a viable it's Farrah Khan it is worse then that's the way Farrah Khan is to me he's one of the biggest biggest sin racist and the country you see him posing for pictures with Obama\nAnd all these other Democrats and Keith Ellison and the rest of these folks you think he's just wonderful because after all when you were black and you're a Muslim you\nCan't be a racist you can't be a big it but we all know that not to be true it is absolutely true speaking of strange things the French we have a French\nLawmaker who is

out there there there that's where it's coming from\nI I it's just unbelievable to me but see they have nothing to run on all they're doing is running against Trump and I was looking at a tweet

victims or do what he said was the principal cause of so many sexual abuses homosexuality it's\nHypocrisy he wrote to refused to admit that this scourge is due to a grave crisis in the spiritual life of clergy and not take measures to remedy it of course in this day and age you can't\nYou know you can't criticize homosexuality even inside the church these days but what he's saying is\nA big cause of that quote unquote political correctness has been going on inside the church that people just turned a blind eye to it it it's almost like saying well we can accuse somebody because their moslem

Ryan\nIt's good I mean it it it's it's typical Clancy stuff you know I'm a I mean I like that but it is a lot of high tech and you know 'cause some of this stuff is in March Julie believable but in one of the scenes\nYou have a Jack Ryan talking to a superior and they're talking about essentially profiling Jack Ryan is upset that he didn't that he saw something that should have been a red flag for him and he didn't say something because\nWell it would you know it would mean that he was profiling somebody\nAnd so his boss who was Muslim in this now he wasn't in the original you know Clancy books but his boss is his Muslim now and so he he gives them an example he said let me tell you something let me tell you story\nHe said on nine eleven\nHe said there was an airline attendants and it wasn't the one I've always talked about 'cause that's man that's really too damning thing you know he this guy saw uh Mohammed opt out one of his comes as I saw them and I said this is not a terrorist I don't know who is but then I had the mentally slap myself 'cause we're not allowed to profile it wasn't that story\nHe says and I assume this is a true story that they're taking out of history\nThat one of the ticket agents\nWas um the processing the tickets for two people that got on the plane and they had bought two first class tickets\nAnd he says as they walked away I noticed that their shoes were a of poor quality and ... and dirty and they didn't really comport with them and the rest of their dress and a first class tickets\nAnd so this guy asked jak why what was the guy supposed to do alert the authorities because of their shoes you just can't do that then I went well hell yes you can do that if you think there's something strange\nAbout somebody's appearance or whatever and you have a reason to suspect them for whatever reason what happened to all this see something say something\nAnd I'm I'm I'm shaking my head is he's going well of course you can't say stuff about that of course you can that's what the whole see something say something about if something doesn't add up\nThen maybe you run a little bit more of a check on these two guys buying first class tickets and

the Saudis explanation about ... death possible he has made clear he does not want the international controversies him in and to billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nWhile Trump appeared to be making light of the situation one else correspondents association didn't find it funny\nThey issued a statement today from the president Oliver nuts and the statements all American should ... from the president's praise for a violent assault on a reporter during doing is constitutionally protected job this amounts to the celebration of a crime by someone sworn to uphold our laws\nAnd an attack on the first amendment by someone who is solidly pledge to defend that\nWe should never shrug president cheerleading for a violent act targeting a free and independent news media\n[noise] now you know this is the first step towards what I'm Talking about it's not going to be long before they say well look at that age praising the body slamming a reporter he called the media the enemy of the people which he didn't he called the fake news the enemy of the people and all this amounts to a a tested wink and a nod\nTo executing and dismay and bring a member of the media by the Saudi Arabians that's going to be coming next you know it is\nNow we got the proud to the Proud Boys that were in the bra I guess last weekend they'd\nBeen arrested this was the New York city where ah one of them was making a speech and outside and people was waiting for them and they came out and they were fighting within people now know Reston ... of course\nI don't know all the particulars in that but ... is known to be violent but the news media won't even call these folks antique but they're all them are protesters dressed in all black\nWho do you think that is where their faces covered with black men Dennis I think is probably antifa\nSo we've got somebody here who actually knows a member of the Proud Boys Gina you're up next to Jean how are you\nHi how are ya\nI'm doing well so you know one of these Proud Boys\nI you know originally from New York and I haven't been many years but I grew up with one of the guy on they weren't going to travel by then but it now\nAnd they're issue is not about race and all that issue it with their teeth and how they get away with the violence that they get away with that they show up\nAt a place to start up ... show and tape at target\nAnd that that there is they're not going to get in and let it ... people at a rally get attacked they fight and that's what a crowd boy they say what wake up to it that is correct on there or not you know\nA gang getting out of law the air air thing it's fighting against it that paper and you're\nIt it why can't keep it that was there it was also a rally in Rhode Island a couple of weeks before that and then have that came out came there are and started\nAnd they came with fire extinguisher a bad thing and there was another all and the Proud Boys were there to protect the rally so they're not a lot of gay they're not that they all have John ever get tired of this group and keep getting away with what they get away with\nReloaded I Want him to even got away with it again because I don't think any member of and people was arrested in that role\nYou're correct to two of the a Proud Boys it get arrested in New York but I think it's a charge that's got to be dropped I honestly think that\nNow we shall see when I think this just enemies are somewhat free trade that the regime of things for the update on that [noise] All right let's just say enemy lose their motive and Stan\nSaudis confirmed the death of the journalists top military general dismissed and Saudi Arabian Eighteen Saudi's have been detained\nOne of the suspects in the interrogation gone wrong has mysteriously been killed in the car actually we told them yesterday that was really guy got back to Riyadh and all of a sudden oh my ... him oh he was killed in the car wreck\nStrains isn't so now comes the big question what is the Trump Administration can do about this what's the president going to do and uh I'm doubting seriously he's going to do anything before November six and you're saying well that's just political\nWhat are what ... what does he supposed to do I'm not sure what people want him to do a sanctions against Saudi Arabia I don't know I mean are we going to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia or whatever and then you see the oil prices Mike right before the election and then you know what I'm just telling you everything is political so after seeing gym out there\nSince ... stuff you just read about the Proud Boys is mostly crap\nGavin again is those two shows on C. R. T. V. and as a self described libertarian an ark is that has converted to conservative family man and strongly supports Trump I see him as a solid citizen\nThe group is a new satire they make fun they make fun of themselves they will however confront antifa as Dina was just saying and will not allowing people to beat on them without fighting back you can go on his shows websites on C. R. T. V. and see live footage of most of the confrontations\nAnd all I see as antifa thugs provoking violence and getting some when they attacked the Proud Boys\nAs you might imagine Gavin get snow on his big media coverage\nAnd the New York city commit a commerce are undoubtedly relishes any opportunity to arrest any of the Proud Boys while ignoring the antifa antagonist gym\nYou know we told you win this thing broke about the Proud Boys earlier this week I guess it was Andrew Cuomo came out and says we do not tolerate people like this in our city and I'm going I'm\nAt that point there was you know it was it was just there were two groups there were arguing and getting into her bra so you're going to ban people that are like this there hate groups they don't call antifa hate group\nNow again I'm not advocating violence and I don't know squandered by the Proud Boys but I Do know antifa and these people you want to talk about songs in violent these people are thugs and they're violent\nBut you don't get the news media hammering on these folks day after day you don't even think I Would have to check and see I doubt very seriously if you'll find antifa listed as a hate group on the Southern Poverty Law Center is website\nWinds and because the economy's and the companies don't get listed as hate groups see because they're doing I was gonna say the during the Lord's work but they don't believe in the lord so they're doing they're doing what needs to be done\nAnd this is where we've come in this country where we've got the mainstream media covering for a bunch of thugs it's a matter of fact you\nCan even call them a mob a lot of these mobs you see from the left is out there are antifa and CNN won't let you call them a mob beep and say we won't even say the him word
