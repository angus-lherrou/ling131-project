don't know who doesn't recognize that fat right she just wasn't prosecuted\nFor breaking the law of the U.S be espionage law and the ... of trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act law by putting the server in her home\n\nAnd we have gone through this ... the actual law and even told me said well it yet but no reasonable prosecutor would do it because we've never fought an instance like this yeah because you never had a secretary of state but put a private server in their home\nTo avoid the freedom of Information Act and to allow foreign entities and she knows that she's smart enough former first lady former senator secretary of state to know\nThat our enemies are looking for anything that's on secured mhm but thinking and believing though that's okay we know what the intent was he in that everybody knows with the intent was I Want to keep stuff private I don't want it to be documented by the government\nAs is law to be archived by the government right now the lawyer for subject to freedom of Information Act right that's what like lock her up about it's not about locking up because she ran against Trump\nSon about locking her up because she's married to bill ... it's not locking up because they produce the offspring of Chelsea Clinton who now wants is is expressing interest in front of him for political office\nWell it's not it's not based on rhetoric is based on a fat right that she broke the law and that she is not above the law\nNow you may disagree with their analysis but you cannot disagree with the fact that backup what they are saying\n\nAnd so they use it by the way they use that every single time and the like the last month where I've seen them saying well let's see what you're saying that the lock her up lock her up that's uncivil that's a no it's not meant to then it's actually it's meant to promote civility but you locked up people that have committed crimes but you believe in committed crime right\nI mean\nThat's something that is provable by the way that fact that basis is not debatable right\nThe actual facts in the case nobody has debated no she hasn't gone to trial or shows and gone to ... you're right but nobody debate facts\nRight and nobody debates what the last day right it's simply call me who hated Trump they didn't want a prosecutor now\n\nWe know the whole story when we've been through it before we've gone through the last specifically we went through the first draft of as we know the first draft of analyzing Hillary Clinton what she did and how they changed the language of it because the language that they originally had was the exact context\nOf the law that she broke right that she was not prosecuted for she broke the law this is the fact she broke the law\nUsing

Nashville's largest way\nThe only way we're talking Ninety nine seven [noise]\n\nFollow goes for [noise] and\nHe's currently I'm Jerry maxim or eight six six Ninety\nRead I welcome and a good morning yeah so you know when when we talk and analyze the mid term elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans are and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing the Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have had it too late but it's still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when a all of us I mean we here at at at our job\nHad to put in for you know benefits here are the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it\nA Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now and we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open that you know they did a horrible job or a you know when it came to especially premiums\nThat we're going to sky rocket and we said they've got to come up with something\nAs to what they're going to do when they really happen and Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and so the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away this was three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters were not yet made up their minds\nAt the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans to earn the votes of these undecided voters an honor commitments to the Republicans who already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken\nHealthcare system and he goes to the whole thing that the truth be Republican principles up for the book for America as a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by healthcare system but it's simple to use innovative and affordable\nWe believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance that meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost and quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American in a simple understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions\nAbout their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith preexisting condition so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically improve health outcomes while significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship is the center of ineffective\nOf care system and that should not be disrupted by micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have earned their health care benefits and that they\nTheir families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats or a private third party\nPayers or middle men we believe in a competitive healthcare market where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare\nInterferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less asked access to treatment and leads to long wait times for critical care we believe that the current health care system\nIn America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is so much less effective at helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system\nIn an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future\nAnd then he goes on to the Republican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOr the or a six billion new to fight opioid epidemic in the past the right to try legislation passed historic VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go through the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right we do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it\nGoes to the states the states make a decision as to what they wish to do\nRight and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire

I think one of the first things they will do is Medicare for all\nYeah right\nI I just believe that my liberal friends would say what good are you if you want a house and you're not putting in Medicare for all it's all you've talked about ... so they would want Medicare for all we were wearing it where where do you know the price tag on that one\nYeah right\nWell and a half of America is for Medicare for all right now if we don't care about spending sure so Medicare for all I don't know where the free college will go anywhere\nWhether they'll just you know drop drop that one I think the only thing or whether they'll drop ... think about that so just hypothetically if they took the house ... and and all the promises of the Democrats have talked about this is an interesting discussion that we haven't had yet a great hypothetical or would they 'cause I\nI just believe that health care is is there a thing and they and they want to get it on the table and they'd want to get yeah they'd wanna early on get the ... the Republicans either say yes to it or no to Medicare for all\nRight because they would then want to use that\nThey called them over the head with rhetorically speaking yes [noise]\nAh so would they go for with the with the house now look it has no chance of passing a Republican Senate that's not known point the point is you want to put people on the record would they would the house and go for her [laughter]\nThings like guaranteed income\nAnd the the baby bonds well here's a question do you float that now\nKnowing you can't ever deliver the promise or do you keep that promise alive for twenty twenty or do you use it and do you use it or in the run up to the to the election you make it an election issue that you may find an election issue that\nYeah you you say right now I'm happy to get out or it's not going to\nGet done now but if we got the Senate and we got our a White House here's what we would do so so what you do is you bring it up and you still bring it up and it doesn't get passed and you bring it up again right you bring it up as an election issue mhm\nYeah he's I think you you were an throw it against the wall and knowing is going buddies that resistance if if your Democrats and you take the house you got to ... you have to make your statement\nTo you're far left base to you wish to energize\nThem yeah and you're not going to do with little tweaks here and there are a different government spending out there no no no you're\nNot going to look you you're not going to make any any ground\nOr anything short of the big game the big prize is not going to is not going to work for you I here's another one because remember how infrastructure\nWas a big thing just a couple of months are going up [laughter] ah\nI mean everybody's memories remember him a runner [noise]\nAll right but the Democrats the Democrats get in the house and let's spend a ton of money the president will go for it\nWell we know that that was no now the Senate won't go for the Senate and well okay so here's a question here's the question though\n[laughter]\nDo the Democrats in the house believe that there are things that the president will side\nWith him on but can they risk that in that they would be appealing to the president to get the work\nDone and to try and convince the Senate no that is on infrastructure not not on Medicare no because I have agreed with the president before and it has some change their attitude towards them\n\nSo that's not a threat of them working with the president that's not going to be out right Schumer's already\nDone it with with budget things have already work they've already worked together on some of this stuff so\n[noise] um so they they're willing to work with them and then than separate themselves from the ... especially if it's spending money\nWell those fancy it's never built and beside him while he's trying to get into law that point Adam and call them Hitler\nYes well we have set up a ferret White House it's never been about where he actually stands politically mhm because as we said the president is actually\nA on judges yes he is a construction which would make him a conservative\nThere he is on tax cuts\n\nYou and I even talked about the fact that you know when republic that the Democrats running for office of talked about we need to increase corporate taxes back to twenty five percent and we went wow used to be thirty five\nAnd we you know we we mentioned that would have a couple of Democrats are brought it up we need to get that corporate tax backup they won't even put it back up to thirty five percent which is a huge win\nFor conservatives out there but on government spending you know the president's up there\nTalking about OK each each of\nEach of the branches of the executive branch has to cut five percent that's nothing now with the increased spending in other areas that that that happens right but I just you know with not much is going to get done if they Democrats take the house nothing's going to get done over the next\nTwo years at a ... everything everything will be positioning yes it will be the run up for twenty twenty right because\nDemocrats control what legislation would get through the house so it wouldn't matter even if the Republicans had a shot at at getting some things passed because you had\nSome Democrat representatives let's say they had a tour ... there's a possibility Democrats might only have a house by two or three boats right as a possibility of Anthony yes\nIt is but they can also control what actually gets on the floor because they had the leadership at that point yes so I don't see anything over the next two years getting done except for positioning statements made by everybody and\nThe other possibility I Would see is using the house cause you and I talked about okay\nThey could say let's do it in the structure building working with the president because of president has big big and infrastructure mhm and you get enough Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to get that done yeah so but I don't think in the Senate well ... and probably are not like not the Senate 'cause I just don't think Mitch McConnell would I I just don't think it would get through\nNot if you're not if you increase the amount of ... I think that would be\nUm I I could be wrong I could be wrong I mean remember there's only really what do we say a conservative and a half\nOkay oh here's the question does the majority leader assuming that the Republicans you know hold the Senate which it looks like they will but that does the sacrifice that on infrastructure knowing people don't care about infrastructure or spend it with and that's a great point\nIt's not the big gotcha issue that uh that uh medical care for all would\nI I I guess I Would I guess I Would look at this and and um say I my I guess my point was\nWill if the Democrats took the house would they attempt to divide the executive branch from the Senate\nBy coming up with things that they believe the president would like that the Senate Republicans would not want well here's an here's an end to try to put a wedge going into twenty twenty okay with the president criticizing the Senate as you get as you're heading towards twenty twenty so your\nUltimate play here's what I mean the Democrats clearly one they want the the the Senate the house\nAnd the White House\nSo in playing the president against the Senate it's all about you know if if they would want to get something done you know for the sake of getting it done you know what I mean having something look we've ... we've accomplished we got this done we can get a lot more done if we get the White House\nI was with the dentist to cramp ... toothbrush and makes brushing most simple affordable and surprisingly enjoyable quit sensitive suddenly vibrations that a gentle on your gums and built in time and that pulses to guide you around your mouth old packed into a beautifully slim and dies out of the medium design we also to live a fresh brush heads on a dentist recommended schedule just five dollars for\nThree shipping attention to the section on clip the time magazine distinction\nOf one of the best intentions of the upgrade your ...\nAnd stop brushing better with quit\nQuit start suggests twenty five dollars and it's guaranteed for life with a refill plant sign up now I'd get clipped dot com slash W W O and you'll receive your first refill pack free with a quip electric toothbrush that's your first refill pack free at G.
