I'm not one of those\nDemocrats ... now I ... it's it's I think it's horrible in what it's trying to do you know what I'm\nTrying to get done from the ad because it well it's it's just bizarre it's can try the only thing that\nThat I can think of is that there are internal polling is showing that independence or leaning haul these way and one of the reasons is because remember she uses these specific word crazy Democrats well they did it right or some kind of there's a there's a reason that you there's a reason that you do that\nThere's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment of those undecided voters that\nYou're going after that in your internal polling you have found out they believe and and I don't know why because I didn't do I I was in ... to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be\nA you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing\nYeah Republicans whatever but in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party in a political ad\nMeans OK I'm Still safe from the base the base Democrats or I don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence\nAnd they're leaning Holly's way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress\nAre crazy that can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad\nI mean could you imagine remember this isn't even a you can't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area this is the state of Missouri and this is a Senate race mhm and so inside her campaign which means\nNot just in her campaign but other campaigns\nAcross the country this is something\nThat Democrats which ... ... who wish to promote themselves\nAnd pretend to be moderate what they're facing is a significant portion of independence\nWho believe that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party are crazy way in which shows that everything that has happened in the cabinet thing in going into restaurants and is having an effect on independence otherwise they would run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know being a the part of the I I guess group that was being polled must have use those words specifically otherwise it's horrible\nWriting because I think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill a could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides and right now at ... proud of some of the things that are going on in my ... with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that person ...\nBut that that's the point that's a great point right there yeah it was\nSpecifically using the term crazy Democrats I Want to have a reviews that any Democrat some someone had to have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats not extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of my party because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side and in one direction and and to a a further extent well no that's not what's going on\nIt it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words\nThat's the only way that happens that's the only way those words end up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy must've appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times and they're\nIn their internal going in you know you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race ... which means they are doing every type\nOf of polling an analytical research you can get in front of you get down to this point here and you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is if you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there is a buildup\nThat word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ad strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom she's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too\nIt's a poor attempt I think at recreating a conversation\nThat people are you know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and\nAnd portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate\nIt would be two guys going man those Democrats are crazy I don't know but I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill that's the actual conversation so you have to have you have to counter it with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt\nBut that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the top things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... and and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri raised in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded that you are in each and every day\nBut you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that Holly as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym during work hours ... with\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that say only thing they can make up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well\nHere's the thing it's ... I was thinking oh wait a minute I Wonder if he could pick me up some wine next time he goes because\nPeople go to the gym during the day all the time well what's what's the evil people run errands all the time just assume OK just to frame right that it's if it's on company time and it's it's well the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time that's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five\nI'm guessing there's I'm assuming you hours ...\nI'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes line meetings of why aren't they going to be a part of a job [laughter] but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went ... and ... and that's but from an outsider you've heard that in your went that's a pretty weak well for an atom desperation that's pretty weak ... ... ... I Would have I Would I\nHave said against ... strategically this is the only thing we are talking about here strategy\nWait a minute he hasn't tried one case\nYeah the guy just doesn't have the experience he doesn't have the experience of attorney general for state\nHe's certainly doesn't have experience to serve in the Senate the war he went and bought some wine and went to the gym on on a while on the clock that's that's what you got by the way when does an attorney general not on the clock that exactly\nAll packed into a beautifully slim and dies Eli medium design we also to live a fresh brush heads on a dentist recommended schedule just five dollars with free shipping attention to the section an quip the time magazine distinction of one of the best intentions of the upgrade your cat and stop brushing better with quit\nQuit start to just twenty five dollars and it's guaranteed for life where the regional plan sign up now I'd get quip dot com slash W W O and you'll receive your first refill pack free with a quip electric toothbrush that's your first refill pack free at G.

have gotten an email sounded may rise we addressed it to start the the the the show a off with but a National Review and it's being picked up by you know I'm a social media uh uh some different a conservative Web sites have\nHave picked it up and this is where National Review a wrote the article that said the pipe bomb or and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this is an article that came out a at nine nine PM from jak crow of National Review\nAnd the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right into a link to that right they link is the right so we linked to the story and\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our pre she'll meeting when I read it I said oh it's saying it then I read in the second time I said well no it's not saying it because what it says is a law enforcement official such tests have determined\nThat a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN\nAlong with a pipe bomb was harmless right route\nOr out your harmless referring to the powder though that it that the indication as the it refers to the powder not a pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stated to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw active lied bombs that could have gone off ... we've seen what but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean\nWe have seen suspicious packages I'm I've been looking at the last time I checked Fox News about\nTwenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages uh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though are actually in a calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linking to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a\nPackage sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced right and they're headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites for picking that up we don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the sand yeah that's that's the point\nIs that right the the the story that they are referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those ... from the a P right\nYou know so it it's just because the problem is is with with\nIf you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction\nIf you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so you know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah they're doing but it was an oversight fear in my opinion\nBecause that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading

carry on with the Saturday schedule speaking to a future farmers of America and to make America great again rally we don't want to let people\nThat are evil change our lives\nBefore heading to the rally he pledged to tone down the rhetoric is crowds love with one exception\nAnd I'd have a much different tone frankly if the press was even handed the press was fair I'd have a much different out all the time the president\nYou at one point I even signed up and was using it and then they just started screwing their best customers and saying oh no no no you can't go see as much as a movie a day I never do that anyway that at the most I think I saw two and a week but then they cut it down to three months for the same ten bucks and it was like no\nAnd then they mess that up to those of us that were on MoviePass at one point or another I don't know anybody that still doing it\nIf you are save your ten bucks because I Can't imagine it's helpful to you because then it wasn't just fine three movies a month ten dollars that's still cheaper than one movie in most places yeah but then they were surge pricing\nFive dollars more if a lot of people wanted to see the same movie which basically meant\nEvery Friday and Saturday Night when most people want to go out to a movie it was more costly\nAnd then they started lemonade and movies for many theaters because they didn't have the money to pay the theaters where we've talked a lot over the years here on into tomorrow about exploding hover boards and then exploding smartphones\nWell now you can add exploding body cameras to the list of tech products that have experienced some catastrophic battery malfunctions\nThe NYPD said it was pulling thousands of the vibe view Eli five body worn cameras that its officers use after one of them exploded say yeah fortunately no one was injured because the officer wearing it notice that there was smoke coming out of the bottom\nOf the device and immediately route removed it from its his uniform after we took it off the body cam then exploded\nThe NYPD uses over Fifteen thousand body cams with about three thousand of them being this virus view model the vast majority of the others is a model that was made by taser well guess what taser bought vibe view\nA few months back so now it's it's a monopoly again and they're exploding at least one is so that's interesting well I haven't heard yet and as a former police officer I'm always looking into these kinds of things anyway I haven't heard yet of others exploding sure it's happening\nBut if you know of them let us know two and we'll slammed them some are on the air\nAnd speaking of exploding little tip that I learned the hard way this week um if any of your using one of those um video projectors for your home theater system and you haven't turned on and you notice a little Dustin don't use canned air to blow into it as it's on yeah follow this unit you miss this mess that was just yesterday\nAnd he's setting this up and we're we're noticed it because we're setting it up with the ... most digital decorations and doing here out of the studio front window at night really cool digital decorations as they call them which are of zombies trying to\nGet out of there like at the windows and bloody shirts and stuff and and ghost flying around and pumpkins and magical the singing skeletons all kinds of fun stuff for Halloween right and the only problem is the most projectors the standard def one that we have\nIs a very bright and the windows of the studio are tinted and so that wasn't getting out very well well we put this other projector in its place and fed everything but Chris is focusing on the window and noticed a bunch of\nUs just like in the box on the inside yeah so you know I had to spread idea of how deep blue into it and that they had to move the dust stayed in front of the bowl you know and then we have this broad idea well we've got a can of compressed air and the control room that we use to clean up the the mixing boards and stuff you know what to deter it let's try that blew into it a new fireball\nYeah wow and there was a fireball shot out of the projector and then he quickly turned it off it goes well we've just blown that bold I put the ball didn't blow\nApparently ... and then you end up like I said I Would say that's what we discovered I think\nWe of burned all the dust out of it and it gets what there's no more dust it projects beautifully in with a very bright scary projection 'cause it's Halloween stuff\nDon't put on China's [laughter] grave lines thinking like a great minds whichever the line that's the point being is that it was really spooky it was a very large fireball and then that that uncommon hopefully for you Bert smell of electronics\nAnd we thought oh you know we've ruined the styles and dollar twelve hundred dollar project or let alone the bulb itself\nAll of a sudden we thought hey what what would it hurt you know he's he's on plugging it real quick and everything it lets plug it in and see if anything happens\nIt came on well doubled lit up everything was fine no dust ... so we don't recommend fireball elimination of dust yeah but it works it works very strangely\nBut a good tactic to let the fireball was wild was if I can yeah it was like the size of the projector phone\nAnd I thought well that was interesting wonder what else we brought up exploited it smells that electronic burned smell not not a fun thing you know\nFacebook Messenger going back to simplify Matt in hopes and making is there's happier the messenger vice presidents ... ... ... ... put the focus that messaging and connecting according to a study done by messenger Seventy one percent participants said simplicity with a top priority\nFunny that they do their own study in messenger about messenger says to hopefully get some positive response but instead what was the the biggest complaint then\nIt went in simple enough there you go\nBack to redesign messaging app condense the previous that as nine passed down to only cabs have cats people and discover gosh\nBut in September of faith but right now than a blog post at the company had three hundred million active users for Facebook story the messenger stories their app dominates smaller platforms like Snapchat which he played only a hundred and eighty eight million active users\nOnly a hundred and eighty million is like only one point six billion and no we're not in South Carolina so wasn't us the show must go on it would have gone on anyway honest to God if we if we won\nThat one and that it's just that we would have a higher stab and standards you know for some other case but on the air would\nStill be ... this is fun this is our product this is what we do for our listeners\nToday than doing it in to Haiti\nOkay well that's true [laughter] coming to you from TV [laughter] that would be different\nBut you were talking about Facebook and among other things Facebook added some additional new features to profiles and stories\nIf you care to use them last week they rolled out more music features giving you some more ways to integrate their various licensing partnerships with all three major labels into stories if you do that sort of thing you could also now incorporate them into profiles\nAnd the F. B. owned lip sync live feature\nSo now you can put music among other things in those features good luck with that as if there's not enough goofing is on Facebook as it is\nGreat now my kid will be given me\nSo I'm probably the British company Dyson best known for vacuum cleaners and those uh air jet hair dryer era hands I asked him to be All right we'll talk stops I'm doing it but there are plans to build an electric car\nOh great that's going to suck it up and I thought I'd see their end but in order for it to work you have to put your hands simultaneously into two little areas right

joining us is against the presents a practical hands on plan to get this break up and then make up with your phone and the author of how to break up with your phone is Catherine Catherine welcome into tomorrow how are you\nI Am doing well thanks so much for having me\nIt's a pleasure first of all the the title of your book got our attention and I said well we talked about this on the show a lot you know the people that are spending way too much time on their phone or in some cases it's not just millennials\nAre that have no other part in their life it seems to just beyond their device and there is certainly more to life about that I Love how even on the back of your of the cover of your book it says it's not you it's your phone\nWhich is so typical where with a breakup of any kind you know no no no it's not you it's me [laughter]\nYou know I think we should move on and it just sort of brings it home I think for a lot of people\nTo say gosh you know that's a good point that you know I Can't be beyond arm's reach of my phone any time give me an idea about what possessed you to do how to break up with your phone and middle let's get into some of the fun stuff you cover\nSure well I'm a health and science journalist by background I'm already interested in behavioral change in the effect that things like this where we'd be having on our mental and physical health\nBut I also a couple of years ago just started to realize I was spending way too much time on my phone and in particular it came to a head when I had a baby and I notice that there were many times in which she would be looking at me and I will be looking down on my phone do and that really upset me yeah not a good feeling\nYou know to go down a mom right yeah right that they are I'm over here [laughter]\nRight right right it was definitely not what I wanted to be doing to her or with her or I mean you know also that wasn't what I wanted my experience motherhood it'd be like or my own life so it really was a wake up call to say how much time on my spending on that divide what am I getting out of it\nAnd if that's really how I Want to be spending my time\nPoint because I mean something as simple as we talk about this all the time for years on this show do do you think life could be so much better if you unplug a little bit and not just your phone but your computer and just being online and do whatever but think about that and then most every\nBut he says well yeah of course would be more fulfilling bought I got to see how many like ... I got posted I'm looking at a cantaloupe and the grocery store or any number of things that people immediately all of us have excuses for why we're still on our phone instead\nRight we definitely do have excuses I mean it just to clarify when they break up with your phone I don't mean throw your phone away really are illegitimate they useful amazing falls right I mean try to distinguish between\nThings that are actual actually beneficial productive for fun uses of your time with your phone is to separate those from that stuff is just a waste of time like\nEndlessly checking her legs are new cantaloupe references or whatever they're talking about you know you really want to start to hone in on what makes you feel good or productive that your phone and keep that stuff and then figure out what makes you feel not so good and work on minimizing or eliminating eliminating that\nAnd I'm sure your research Catherine has found the same kinds of things that we've talked about a lot and and that is the phones and and specifically apps are designed in many cases to addict us we've got to come back I mean Facebook probably the prime example\nRight I mean I think more and more people are coming to realize that we are not that product that's all right we're not the customers that these apps where the product senator attention that insult except for many people that's a useful thing to think about it you know wait a second I'm actually making money for someone else right now by giving them my time and attention for free\nWith that said that I mean it's not enough to just know that you actually then have to take steps to decide what you want your boundaries to be and and figure out how you can protect yourself again to keep using social media and the way that you enjoy but not letting it profit more than you want it to off of your time and attention\nAnd I'm I'm pretty sure that most everyone listening is saying I hear ya I agree I absolutely you know want to break up with my phone a little bit you know and still use it but of course be productive\nBut I've still got to be social and it's oh I've been calling it the anti social media lately because we're not very social when we're just on our phones but why do you think overall people do need to break up with their phone at least a little\nWell Italian lots of effect on us that we're only coming to recognize it really is a technicality to maintain our focus and concentration it's obviously affecting our sleep because we're staying up late and we want to looking at our phones and lack of sleep is associated with all sorts of very well established health effect effects\nIt's also having impacts on our credit activity in our creativity which I think it's interesting and upsetting in that if you're constantly filling your mind\nWith new staff fled alone probably kind of chunky stuff you're not giving your brain space to process what you've learned her experience and you're not giving yourself space to come up with any new thoughts known a very real sense I think that our phones are making that dumber smartphones making you down\nAnd I think that's made me really concerned about\nAnd that's for adults I mean and then for children there's additional concerns such as they haven't developed their brains yet so it is not I don't think the best thing to do with that have phones and that type of stimulation may get from our smartphones to get the first kind of shaping that our minds get\nAnd of course as a parent you know we all realize that okay but it's finally shut them up fine here's my phone or find here's the tablet you know play the game do what you want to do because now they're quiet and we can enjoy dinner or we can enjoy the T shirt or maybe enjoy the company of others that we are with\nAnd then the problem with that crunch is just that it's a crutch and it becomes more and more of a problem with the kids are saying all I've got to do is make a fuss and then I get the phone well they need to break up with your phone as well\nAnd it is about unfortunately about lights and oh I Wonder if so and so solve this hey did you see my posed well you didn't like it [laughter]\nAnd that right right I think it's like something you don't get a like an instrument but something happened at all it all ended up for it I feel like well yes it did happen and you probably enjoy that more if you wear a coat\nIn it I mean but I find I find that to be very hypocritical of the social media companies to talk about how they're supposedly all about in helping to engage in torture actions quote unquote when in reality\nThey're really just trying to get to spend more time on them and I like to point out to people one of the things I found the most fascinating the similarities between a social media app and the ... you know they know casinos don't have clock they don't have windows and that so that you lose track of time and if you notice the and looking at the social media feet away their design\nThey're very much deliberately designed to make us lose track of how much time we're spending on them so they wanted more money off showing that\nNever thought about it that way but you are absolutely correct one thing that you said which uh which kind of caught me you talk about the challenge and then you'll send an email was helping us out and so forth well gee I'm Sorry Catherine but I've got to pick up my phone to get your email\nCan track it on your desktop and\nPeople are like oh isn't that ironic because I recommend offered like say like apple blockers and time tractors and things for the phone isn't it ironic to use technology to protect ourselves from technology and it was well no it's actually you're dealing with a\n... you know when you're dealing with it you were saying that the device and you need to have a you're trying to use it while you're still being addicted to it so\nIt makes a lot of sense to me to use the tools that are available within that device to help you get better at putting it down to me I think it's just really um you know you have to recognize and appreciate tool\nOh for sure and and use them wisely and when as you said before we're not saying don't ever be on Instagram and Facebook and tweet and so forth they of course you want to do those things if you've been doing them and if you care\nI Do have some friends or even as the host of the tech showed that say oh I don't do any of that I don't tweet I'm not on Facebook I don't Instagram what the heck is that while you know it's twenty Eighteen you do know that right [laughter]\nWhat what it's All right right some people don't have that issue because they just don't care about the social media stuff then and it's like you\nSay yeah you know it didn't say you can also you can use social media that getting sucked into it you can say like I don't care if you live I liked that know that for your business is important to post new you know information or to\nUse it as a tool so again it's not all are bad bad or good but you need to be aware of how you are being manipulated ... years and then make sure that you have a clear purpose for what you're doing it you kind of transparency it's like knowing what whatever it went up to and being okay with that\nCatherine Bryce who's the author of how to break up with your

[noise]\nOoh there's some hollow any kind of stuff but\nThat ... bah humbug where there is not about humbug for Halloween what are you just say you just um you don't have all this with their blue [laughter] of you who use that word but I find that interesting though that the average Americans got to spend a hundred and eighty five dollars on Halloween\nAnd I've not spent that much you know we we have that at most projector were doing some decorations you know a digital decorations outside the studio window at night\nAnd and many people have commented I've got security cameras that are showing people stopping or or walking up the driveway and recording what's going on the window and stuff and of course we have a Bluetooth speaker outside of weatherproof Bluetooth speaker and we're using currently ascent highs are Bluetooth transmitter is very cool\nSo and then we've got um in terms of the blue to speak or that we're using to is one of the new film on flares right they're very cool Bluetooth lantern speaker\nSo we can even turn the lights you can either send them to just rotate colors or be on a steady color or what I like doing is a change colors and and uh illuminate with the voice or the screams or the scary music\nAnd that draws attention can you can lie in your driveway with them 'cause they say you can pair up to a hundred of those speakers together I don't have the money [laughter] like I have one but the fact is you can which is kind of neat because what what other things can you pair a hundred speakers and these are nice size lantern speakers too\nThey're pretty good and they charge during the day and they last pretty much all night and so far the neighbors having complained even when we've crank it up\nBut that's kind of a cool thing to get into the spirit and I guess if I had to buy all those things probably would have spent a hundred and eighty five dollars what\nBut what the heck\nNetflix added nearly seven million new subscribers in his most recent quarter about two million more than the streaming company expected Netflix now has more than a hundred and thirty seven million people tuning in around the world\nBeating its own subscriber expectations as a big win for the company last quarter of the company said that it gained about a million fewer cars customers unexpected sending it stuck plunging\nNearly six million of the new subscribers this quarter came from overseas and lists of widely expected that that would be the case but Netflix said that it's international games were even greater than it had to initially forecast Netflix says they expect to add another nine point four million subscribers in the last part of this year which really wild as all these subscribers\nAre paying for a lot of new original content and they've become one of the biggest producers of original content who would have thunk it\nWhile I was reading it in and I think most parts of Europe is now a requirement for these providers all your Netflix and Amazon Prime that they have to provide at least a certain percentage of their own original content in order to be approved I guess to operate\nWithin that hanging on the back and Facebook and apple coming out with their own original content\nOh great [laughter] that's true but you gotta wonder is it going to be top quality stuff or are they going to try to do it on the fly pretty cheap\nI've seen I've seen 'em I follow one of these Facebook shows on coal returning the favor with Mike Rowe and it's actually a a\nNice produced show looks like it would actually be on broadcast TV but it's just instead it's on Facebook really and I have a Facebook app faced with videos app on my a fire stick at home that's how I watch the show so it's to me it's like it's on TV and I love Mike Rowe I didn't know he was doing that what is it called it's called returning the favor oh go wait a minute\nOur people understand and many are also in recovery called for support and strings you can call for someone who can do is unwilling it's an act of love together we can help you beat this thing in the race addiction from your vocabulary once and for all\nEight hundred it's fine to me and my twin ... eight hundred sixty five ...

T. auditing among other things welcome the c._e._o. of night lion security Vinnie Troy Vinnie welcome into tomorrow how are you\nA good great thank you for having me\nIt's a pleasure first of all tell me what a boutique cybersecurity firm is what does that mean\nShort so there are a number of cybersecurity firms that obviously very inside and and we're um we try to keep our side a little bit on a smaller sided focused on more the high end security professionals so we we really stop it with a kind of the advanced skills that they need to go out and how far customers\nA gotcha and and that is becoming more and more critical all the time and it's like to do is do you guys for a for working the way you do because it's you know other companies just oh we just want to grow we want to be enormous but then you're right you can't take care\nOf individual clients as much as I mentioned these days with all kinds of cyber security issues\nThat you've probably got your hands full as an understatement\nYeah it definitely agree with that I I think the other part of it too is you know a lot of the larger firms and is that a more junior level employees or you don't get that are coming out of college that can be trained and and we don't really take that approach right now we're just going for a\nWay that the senior level guys who have been around and that\nDuring the industry for quite a bit and so that really allowed them to give our customers the highest level of all of it\nAlso now one of the things I understand that you guys are are working with some concerned about as we all should be our hackers and voting because the head of these midterm elections\nAll kinds of precautions that are coming out and and folks like you are warning us about in mourning the government and us voters the what can we do to be protected from hackers and have confidence in our electoral system\nWell I I think you know a lot of the newer voting machines now they actually provide you with a few ways\nSo for example I'm the voting machine I use last year had a simultaneous paper and digital valid so as you were putting in your digital input it was actually making a paper copy of that in the ... the results were ever with\nThat and you know there would be that paperback copy already purposes and I think that was really kind of clever I'd never seen that before\nUm so I mean in terms of protecting yourself I think it you know I hate to say that there's really nothing that you know people do it it it's more coming down to\nYou know the state's making sure that they have the machine tested and every you know everything is kind of squared away which\nUnfortunately of course that means trusting I use the term loosely but importantly your local government and and your states that are running the elections to make sure everything is not only on the up and up but as absolutely foolproof as possible\nOr exactly and I think you know at some point it it it does it is going to have to come down to making sure that um or I get relying on you know the states and the government to make sure that they're doing their job and well that doesn't always unfortunately seems to be the case I think you know in this case\nReally at the end of the day there's there's nothing you can do outside of 'em using paper ballots and to be out if I'm not even sure exist anymore\nYou know and of course being a from Miami were based in Miami so we of course had our exciting Florida hanging chads and and the other issues that you wouldn't have with digital concerns\nOr at least not mad but would you know are we more vulnerable to hacking or those kinds of issues or is it is it can we take some hopeful confidence in the fact that that are a elected a process our election process is as secure as it can be right now\nYeah I I think the important thing to realize is that in order for a successful hack to occur\nThere would have to be quite a significant there would have to be a significant amount of infiltration on all the voting centers and there's so many voting centers across the U.S that that type of attack just Sanders just incredibly unlikely\nI mean if as a hypothetical um hackers were to hit you know maybe one or two voting centers at the end of the day\nReally wouldn't be much impact if they were to change those votes just because there's so many of 'em you know wide scale attacks credibly unlikely frankly\nYeah it sounds like it would take almost as many people voting to be able to hack and change those votes\n... exactly and you know when when that was ended up being hot I mean usually there's a vulnerability that boy did and so in the event that maybe and I read that maybe there's some vulnerability of you know a specific type of voting machine thing\nThan the states all you so many different types of voting machine it got it still wouldn't really make that much difference\nYeah I guess we have that going for us to that there are so many older things and some newer stuff for some kind of a hybrid things as you were describing earlier that day I Would be like oh it's not worth it you just go out go out and put up more campaign signs you're going to have better luck [laughter]\nExactly yeah I think the way we're going to see more influence the election and just based on you know kind of like what we saw with the Cambridge Analytica situation where it's just more advertising based and then more power they have specific consumers\nYou know a good point now I've got to ask you about your take on whether or not we'll in our lifetime be able to vote\nWith our mobile device or even a desktop you know do you see the ability for us to vote on line to be able to use our smartphone and be able to vote only once and securely and make it count and all that sort of thing or is are we still a long ways away from that\nI got to be honest I don't know um it seems like a really obvious idea and it seems like something that you think you know we would have by now\nUm but then again I mean when you look at it from the perspective of a tax fraud I mean there are people who submit tax returns multiple times using the same information and they can't even get that right\nTrue you know I don't know\nBut uh do you do would you like to see that I mean ... in it so you know they obviously have to really work harder and and now we're going back to talking about leaks and breaches in hackers in\nBecause now it's a it's a much bigger system in the long run whether it's a a local state or federal election that the details can be messed with because now you you've got more like one central location I guess\nYeah I think um that that's what I mean I think there would definitely need to be a lot of infrastructure put in place and make sure that um\nAnd be one of the resistance is the ghost tech line of waterproof cases now goes tech talks about their cases as protection you can use to dive and swim with your phone we'd probably err on the side of safety though skip that whole swimming and diving part but they may be a very good layer of protection for you to consider\nNow a ghost tech atomic premium will cost you around sixty five dollars\nFor around five dollars you could get a fancy your version of a Ziploc bag with the strapped to where it all around your neck so you don't ever lose it now these bags or just generics they all look mostly the same but they do tend to do pretty decent job if you're not planning to intentionally submerged your phone\nAnd if you're going to risk them and go with one of those we really encourage you to put a piece of paper inside the case of the bag and don't get under water if the papers day's drive and maybe consider putting your finding it otherwise invest in something better\nAnd that that's a good idea because it stick that piece of paper in the airport a little something that's similar weight to your phone that won't hurt if it leaks and just see does it do the job is to paper comes up wet well maybe that's not too good but perhaps a if you're just talking about you just having it handy while you're kayak fishing and so forth\nThen a bag one of the five dollar ones that you can get to protect your phone calls at ... or so forth might be might do the trick and again a strap keep it around your neck you're not going to lose it as easily\nAnd maybe that'll do the job save you a whole bunch of headaches and a lot of money too\nOr just unplugging enjoying the nature\nAgainst true leave the phone in the car but now there's an emergency you want to be able to call for help I guess so yeah we we don't recommend if you're out by yourself in nature\nThat you don't have any way to communicate that will be safe into tomorrow dot

he was temporarily locked out of his Twitter account on Monday due to a concern that he might have been hacked\nUm that must be explained his brief absence to his uh twenty three point one million followers late Monday Night and they seem to have a sense of humor about it the tweet about being temporarily locked out of his account came seven hours after he posted about his love for enemy and that was followed up with and I own HEB all very\n... these are two statements that you probably wouldn't expect to see a billionaire businessman publicly posed but yeah then again this is the mosque and ... and he really posted those are my guests Twitter took that says this doesn't seem like they would be real sweet so they place a cow talking to heat up an act but\nThey were early him that's interesting good to know that they were monitoring though yeah and the thinking oh my gosh she would never have said that he perhaps even act like a lot of the account they forget that this is even mosque and he said some pretty wild they put\nThe guy and apparently they have to keep the president's tweets going yeah they're not allowed to block him\nAnd vice versa I shouldn't be allowed to block anybody for certain just speaking their mind but yeah that's true unless you know start getting into that you know hate speech but this whole different thing yeah and of course nobody does that town not at all ah technology has become so disruptive\nThat now it ruins surprise parties\nYes as I discovered it with her daughter who turned Eighteen Caitlin who for many years hosted kids tack on our show turned Eighteen outgrew the desire to host kids tag as a result\nBut she knew all the way to the surprise party Chris and I are driving over to Naples to surprise her last Sunday last Saturday\nBut she knew a bunch of her friends were all at this one person's house her boyfriend town yeah there were all there and he made up some reason 'cause he was taking her out to a nice dinner for her birthday\nAnd he says oh I've got to stop by the house though because that Nicole has a gift for you and I forgot to bring it so I'll just running real quick and get it and and then we'll go to dinner\nBut she was already looking at what is the sign mainframe I and my friend naps cat\nAnd there they were all at Kyl's house mhm and she when she walked in she didn't look surprised that I grabbed her later and I says so were you really surprised me it kind it she said I went oh really [noise] technology ruining it surprise\nYou know there's ... lots of brings up another thing you know these are you got teenagers most of which are under Eighteen or using these apps these apps are telling everybody where this person is if I wouldn't want my kid being able to be you know people know where they are at all times mhm\nWell the thing is you can only you have to connect to each other to have you know ahead of time you have to that ...\nThat people following you and tend to follow however the teenagers follow each other\nYeah of course and that and then of course then they did see where she ended up going to dinner later with her boyfriend and all that because they're just fine my friends\nTold me don't answer they an attack yeah\nBut we talk about technology being so disruptive usually disruptive it a good way and productive and helpful but ruined the surprise party\nYes as her friends are realizing oh we did ... going to go to ... when she already tacking\nAlthough she would've probably thought something was up to if all of her friends were all of a sudden [laughter] that's true that if it\nWasn't at the house then wherever we're going everybody's going to be there when the imitations that she was told it will leave your phones at home so that\nWhen they never

and CEO of ... job is Kevin Kevin welcome into tomorrow how are you sir\nI'm great Dave thanks for having me on the show it's\nA pleasure to have you we we talk a lot of course about health tech as well on the show more and more these days with so much great technology making a difference in our lives and you guys have decks dumb or not only new exception you stand out in terms of helping so many people literally\nAnd I can save us from experience saving lives by doing what you do let's talk a little bit about first of all tell me about ... and what is constant glucose monitoring for those who may not be familiar then we're going to get into some very exciting new things\nWell decks come as a company as you said earlier we are very focused on continuous glucose monitoring and this is a tool use and the management of diabetes if you've been around anybody with diabetes ah everybody has seen many of experienced the dreaded painful finger stuck\nYes our patient has to take a blood sample and and look at a glucose value\nAnd and it's generally several times a day it's not like ... and you do it it's no every time before you eat several times throughout the day it's that it's painful to\nAnd and it is very very painful and all that information gives you as a number at a single point in time continuous glucose monitoring offers people with diabetes the ability\nParticularly that comes to some of the get that information first and foremost without the dreaded finger stick\nOr a small continuous glucose sensors inserted into your skin and and remains there and you get a glucose treating every five minutes automatically that's transmitted to a device either your phone or addiction receiver or certain Anton palms to whereby that information can come directly to you\nIn addition to the glucose values though we provide patients with very important trends we provide them with arrows to tell them how fast they're glucose as moving up or down\nWe also provide them with the ability to share that day that they're using our mobile app with caregivers and you talked earlier as you introduced our company and the pediatric an adult environment\nFor pediatrics in particular young people type one diabetes if your your child is attending school all day long you know many of the parents have these kids have wound their entire lives around being there three or four times a day for finger six to make sure everything goes well now with our device\nCaregivers can see that technology on their phones regardless of where they are and and take action and combined with that continuous flow of data are very very useful and lifesaving alerted alarms\nAs patients learn their help through continuous glucose data they can set alarms that are meaningful to their care that if they go below a certain value they should be alarmed if they're changing at a certain rate of change going up or down they shouldn't be alarmed\nAnd with those allows patients can then take action to avoid really those dreaded acute events or they can put a patient in the hospital and do something bad but also keep them within a healthy glucose strange over the long term and avoid the long term deadly complications of diabetes\nAnd and you hit the nail on the head especially talking about not only for adults because not only can you help keep an eye as a ...\nYou have or perhaps on mom or dad but also the kids I've heard from so many parents that have said that the cost of glucose monitoring from ... has made such a positive impact on their life and their child's life\nThat the teachers are appreciative of it but you know they get they're able to make contact and say uh do me a favor I I think Johnny might need a little bit of orange juice or something because he's going a little bit low Oh absolutely yeah and then people\nAre able to make those decisions without the fingerprints of course but more importantly\nGetting the information when there's plenty of time to make an occasional needed adjustment and when I said earlier that literally lifesaving you talked about the alarms\nUh shared with my audience experience of of trying a new a little insulin pump a while ago little to blood system and uh it was working so well that it was making me go very low at night until they adjusted it doctors were involved\nBut I didn't know this except for ... telling me hey you're going real low unless you want to wake up and a diabetic coma you no pun intended unfortunately you better get up and have a little soda or to get some OJ or you know do something because of the wake up\nAnd they have these yes exactly and there were so many times until the doctors were able to get it all nice and and leveled out perfectly where if ... didn't wake me up I might not have awaken and that was scary but I'm thinking how do people live without this that\nHave diabetes or anyone of their family you really have to look into this\nWhile you know we ask ourselves that question all the time because\nOne of the best parts of my job there is I get to attend a lot of diabetes functions and I get to meet these young people or or adult term ever and I hear the cheerful stories yeah I've had that kind of saved my life and I've got get high August from kids everywhere picture opportunities\nAnd and I'm just the guy that runs the place and not the scientist who invented it or the\nThe people who who thought of all these nuances are\nCertainly am heavily involved and I know but the relationship we have with our patients is very very real\nAnd very much a driving force in the culture and the development of technology at our company it's very much a marriage of of people's needs and what they want in life saving technology to all the amazing cool things
