I don't think so\nWhat is it specifically think that how how might Hillary Clinton harmed again when campaign to think [noise]\nIt got bad credit [noise] bad ... bad crap picker don't trust their interests are I I the reality is I I voted for her [noise]\nUm I supported her but she does things that um she kept out for herself and she makes a big mistakes eloquent so there you go [noise]\nSo what you're saying is she believes shouldn't run in twenty [laughter] forget about Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty twenty you\nKnow because here's the thing you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in ... many people living inside the beltway or inside of the Chappaquiddick beltway um\nThe ... they they\nWhen they when they go on the you know a speech to hurt or you know um if they if they go out to them just do some rallies right or it is the case for any of them right or left that those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk\nThey're filled with friendly in other words the the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time when you step outside that you step away from it a bit\nI think Hillary got some of this even when she was running and twenty sixteen remember the reporters that approach Cher during that campaign season and started asking questions about bill then they had to pretty much at that point\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter]\nWhere's Hillary was the question and you ... the ... they had to create that well they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable\nSo she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again but it really will be their own internal that will tell them\nYou know our millennials on board now that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she helped Dylan more any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and twenty twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might vote for her but I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty I don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go\nYeah she's just not the ... we need somebody you knew and fresher gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat uh she should be there just for fundraising and she was older I'm gonna get she yeah she was fifty plus I guessing she was the same woman or who said we don't trust her right that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because that somebody who's experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer health care system in America in the early nineties uh so I thought that was really interesting she can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want to emerge around we don't want her people don't people don't trust her\nAnd what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her right and I have found that just to be\nA I found that to be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make her because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before\nBut it came up again the media this week is at Trump's rallies when they talked about Hillary in lock her up that that is that's the instability that that is look you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she opposed you lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you can look at the law and say this is a crime that she broke\nAnd many other people who did this anybody else who did this\nAny normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on not just based on the on what the left is attempting to portray as just\nPure instability they don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based\nOn her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and said and and many have looked at it even not just Republicans conservatives with other libertarians and say\nNow she broke the law right she put the server in her house that's breaking the law she knew that people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state\nThat every foreign government is every ah unfriendly and probably friendly foreign government\nIs looking to tap into anything they possibly can to find out what you're doing\nAs secretary of state by you doing that unfriendly is where we were able to get into some of our top secret you knew it and you did it\nSo you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act that's a crime yup there's two crimes they're the Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act\nThat's what it's about now you might say well but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees with what the law is or what she actually did\nWell it's different than the chant by Rosie O'Donnell on the white or in front of a White House you know that is based on nothing gets based on false which you know saying that this the current president\nIs an agent of the of of Russia a and that and you know again implying that insane in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally\nIn the in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime that nobody debates was broken by her ... that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know it we can point to it\nNow again it is rhetoric that it is the people what they're what the point that they're making it\nShe should be in jail she's not above\nThe law right and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the up and the department of justice at that time right for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a again\nThe same as in any way justifying\nYou're acceptance is guaranteed for one of these insurance policies\nNow for a free information kid with all the details one eight

when we were talking a ... from an earlier conversation and talking about that you know the heated rhetoric of you know calling a Trump Hitler that you know and and going back in because we'd brought this up months and months and months ago\nI I don't even know it might have been after the school shooting much I'm not really sure but when we talked about look heated rhetoric out there and what it means you know what you're communicating now we've never been one that have drawn heated rhetoric\nAnd blame the people have heated rhetoric for somebody who's out and kill somebody we didn't blame Bernie Sanders or anybody else no when ... after the ... shooting we didn't we didn't do that but uh we brought up you know just\nHow inflammatory that kind of rhetoric is because what you're saying is Trump is the same as a guy who committed you know a genocide of six million Jews ... which of course is just the most bizarre statement you could ever make in the only reason you do that\nIs to inflame a rage in people that's why you do it ... because you believe the bell actually by that and they'll be in theory aided\nOr with it and then you got him you've completed the brainwashing by doing that\nYou and I remember that during the Obama administration you brought this up\nTo me just now and he was being called the dictator right we had to get on the air and said guys stop that right went on the issues is not a dictator he won he won he was voted in by the people the United states conservatives and Republicans might have found distasteful but he's not a dictator well\nAnd they we talk about the you know they want the the idea of right the idea of a him acting you know again using the er an executive Penn\nInstead of going to Congress every president has that power we don't agree with that method right but every president has that power um and and you know it was about you know cap and trade and things like that that that he was essentially implemented implementing\nA through uh the EPA every president has that power didn't have the power for\nA recess appointment blindly civil court stopped\n... he lost in right I I think you can find every president\nEventually you know when they served their their terms have been rejected by the courts in some executive order that they have set up you know a put out do they try to stretch the power that they have yeah you have to make 'em dictators no no I think they would be somebody who was not elected see I had was\nDuly elected and and the other part of that as we need to remind you that that's how people vote whether it was two thousand eight two thousand twelve\nThis is how the people voted uh you don't but the the the Democrats want you to believe that it's not how the people who voted um or there or we shouldn't have the ... like they may every excuse in the book it was the Russians are we've got to get rid of the electoral college that's the problem\nUm the uh the the majority of the people didn't vote for him if what if this is what it comes down to this is the process we have in place we have it for a reason\nAnd we respect the constitution and that process but I think\nIt's very important as we talked about before for a ... and we we spent quite a bit of time on this this week is for us not to be that don't argue like them\nRight right\nThey have lost because

expanding as law enforcement officials sees three more suspicious packages Thursday they've got the bomb reports\nNew York city police commissioner wouldn't say whether the apparent pipe bombs were actually ... to explode or if they were just designed to instill fear\nThe NYPD the FBI we're we're taking this seriously we are treating them as a as as life devices\nJames O'Neill said he'd characterize them as suspected explosive devices multiple reports said that the investigation was focusing in on Florida as a transit point for the packages this is now considered a domestic terrorism investigation to which Mayor Bill de Blasio said New Yorkers would not given to fear\nThey're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them Steve captain about new\nThe O T I G I G DOT\nI don't know which go first so there you have it you have somebody who um is well versed in investigating that type of investigation\nThat was the first question almost as if it were a possibility the entertaining of the uh you know all the different ideas the fact is that we don't do the motive of the person or persons responsible\nIs completely on known the whole false flag thing okay one possibility that's one possibility also possible that it is somebody who just flat out\nEight Democrats and is is a wants to make a a wants to send a message and make a point about all of the people who hate Trump we have no idea yet and won't know that until that person is known if ever\nRight and and and both sides are involved in my narrative just you know my narrative is what justifies the conclusion we saw it on social media yesterday you and I talked about that in our pre show meeting ... that you see well Trump needs were apologize because we know it's somebody that you know who supports him\nWho did this and then we saw the false flag it's the falls flat thing you saw the means out they're Democrats are now sending bombs to themselves and everything else on social media\nAnd nobody knows but this is a nation that we live in and and that's part of the discussion that we had last hour we've had a significant discussion on it the ... this week we want to believe the narrative before we even know what the truth was you and I dealt with this\nAlso because we talk of other instances of last hour that we dealt with this we dealt with the Trayvon Martin ... to this day I've no idea what happened now because you have that\nYou have that time span of I forgot the exact types between two and four minutes where nobody knows what happened right\nWe don't know what happened nobody and people were taking sides on that we criticize former President Obama for taking sides remember the beer summit he had no idea the ... the former president when it came to police officers\nAre involved in suspects shootings always took the side of the alleged victim not knowing whether the alleged victim was actually a victim or not that's wrong to do so we set it and ... and it was wrong for the president\nAnd the former attorney general Eric Holder to take sides in that and they took sides early on and then hold his own Justice Department found out\nThat the whole hands up don't shoot was ally when the FBI did the investigation or are there and they talked about the conspiracy in the neighborhood to keep the truth from coming out hands up don't shoot is still used today mhm\nWhen neither side does that it's wrong we should be basing our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media\nWhere people believe that okay I have an audience now and so just like the media there's this third that I'm going to be first and if I get the right conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\nYeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right and you were putting together a puzzle but then that's not what this is the speculation\nPure speculation pure speculation based on zero evidence based on nothing you know if a Catherine heritage or says look ... ... it's possible based on the leaks that are coming out a that it is but that somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle\nTogether a I think she's done some work on a number of stories\nOr over the years but what if you're doing you're going to people that have something for you\nAnd then ultimately you see if that peace but send to the puzzle or how\nThe narrative starts to build out or how the how the truth I guess starts to come together that's all that is called journalists\nFor those under sixty journalism was very important you usually go to our nation and its rarely practice true journalism today because what you have is people wanting to\n'em and they believe they're right in doing so I have an opinion and have their work\nJustify their opinion\nOr their behavior their words they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates because they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do\nActivism in place of journalism is what we see today more often\nThan not and you when you look at a story especially one like this that still unfolding and and the public we don't we simply don't know all we know as one has been found that's it they have no idea\nAnd we're supposed to hide it and what the mode and we're still not sure what has been found\nAnd we're still in the nature of what's been fired\n\nLet's how do you go to George in New York George welcome you're on run Radio Welcome to the show Hi George\nHey how's it going guys good\nShow um yeah I was calling about um [noise] it seems like there's a lot of uh [noise] that are are going around about um [noise] ... ... in the midterms last I heard was Newt Gingrich I think there's a report I charge report actually got where\nI guess some at work I don't know which [noise] saying that the Democrats had two or three chance of winning the house [noise] and it turns out I'm just wondering if\nYou build up this way independent voters know scam away but it's hard to say well you know the law so why\nAre you saying that's why I have you seen that is why Newt Gingrich did that\n[noise] well I'm not sure I'm not sure about hangs Quakers but in general I mean I think she was first\nOf all ... how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the polls sense that they do that would actually encourage independence who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe that can be the point you maybe that was as you point 'cause\nShe I look I when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation was and they'd probably be more willing to tell you after election you know why they why they did what they what they did and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we have a question you don't need silver for example we still question\nYou know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races and make these determinations we still have a ton\nOf of questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more that the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house and a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate\nI think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with Republican\nYeah in fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was that was the headline was directed more on the Republican candidates in those races or republic Republicans in in general believing that they were going to keep the Senate\nOr where the houses\nGoing I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even through polls but if you do it strictly by the polls right now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats\nWould take the house that would not be shocking a when you talk about a first term president uh often that first mid term is is something where the that shift of power happens that happened with a Brock Obama and a two thousand ten right\nAnd so you could look at at at history that dictate says now do we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yeah trend in that area yeah Trump yet cabinet and that's\nWhat I was saying about the polls have you go by the polls in history then then you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nAnd then you look at Nineteen Ninety four ... how did that happen right I was only a talk show host for a couple of years\nI still remember it how shocked everybody was and said whoa really except for ... nobody really got that one did that and that wouldn't really came out of nowhere how did the Republicans take so many seats mhm well there was this underlying you know a underline pass\nExisted and voting excitement from Republicans to go out that somehow nobody saw now with the technology today and with the way that we do polling today have we improved it I don't know well and I will do a little over a little under two weeks from now call outs\nIs the only way you're going to get an answer for I'm a Republican or conservative in many cases you're not going to see them at protests you're not going to see them at at you might see them at a presidential or the ... the president's rallies but you're not going to see them doing these grassroots rallies but the weapons doing right now but the whole get out the vote make sure you out that kind of thing\nOr a independent Bob yesterday and had a post about wow that ... ... a really putting up a fight against Trump and a lot of

to a petition for that and ultimately got that weren't\nA and the biggest still story besides getting frustrated at the the the last ... forty eight hours about the media\nOr you know and nobody can figure out whether these were lie bombs or not the frustration there is only exceeded by the frustration of what in the world is going on\nWith President Trump the inspector general the department of justice and what they were going to release a about the the uh classified information\nAnd as we know the declassified sign of the Pfizer application which is to get the secret worn on Carter Page and the communications between the FBI and the department of justice\nThat we were I've been told by Republicans is information that the American public needs to see\n\nWhich at the last minute the president decided not to release\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice who's only job is to look at irregularities and corruption in the department of justice why has that story died everywhere\nEven in conservative media it is a non story\nWell because I mean you look at that you know leaks nothing nothing on that story\nNow it's it's unlikely from you know from a Horwitz we would see any kind of leaks as to what's going on in the investigation right right but we would hear leaks from the other side and that being the White House and why they insisted on\nHanding out over to the ice sheet\nAnd ... women everything else is like from the White House what would stop this because it would be\nIf we think it's it it just assume that it is beneficial to the president\nPotentially that would be a good reason not to let me let me backtrack that\nMany things have leaked from the White House I own say every so many things when you look at the nature of something that if if the White House believed it was going to help or would it be the position of the chief of staff and advisors to the president that look\nHand this over to the guy gee allow him to do what he\nDoes and don't\nSay well the everybody speculating in the media everybody\nMhm uh about the bombs and then what the motivation is neither speculating ... nobody's\nEven nobody's speculate nobody's analyzing nobody's saying what I haven't seen one story anywhere but maybe one exist that I haven't seen I Would love to see mhm where somebody has made the same point said we have oh wow why did you give it to the inspector general there's only ... the whole thing was trained the story was initially framed\nThat uh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release this information\nOr we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele and we said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is I don't know what the president now I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the Pfizer warned so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you were going to not release it because things were top secret you would have gone\nTo probably your secretary of state who would be dealing with those governments and is also an ex director of the CIA\nAnd you'd be going to Dan Coats your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be given it to the inspector general\nWho only looks for one thing and that's corruption and therefore once it was declassified and people saw what was declassified in the White House they looked and said there are probably possible crimes here\nAnd before we released says we need to first given to the inspector general\nOf the United states to go after the corruption that we see how come nobody has written that story right and if somebody has I haven't seen it\nI've not seen any major publication\nRight the possibility of that story and why this all went to the inspector general why would you give it to the inspector general you saw something that you believe warranted his offices action and what his office deals with is corruption so you're giving him the only\nThe only path that you can go down is you're giving him evidence of corruption in the FBI and the department of justice there's no other path to go down right\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and didn't\nBelieve there was some kind of wrongdoing than there would be no reason to contact or would it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow this looks like there's a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice that's up to ... to write the report\nWas handed over because that's what the inspector general does\n... and by the way we'd be bringing this up and thanks to many of our listeners who I get a few a week\n... people running me emails saying what's going on right what's you guys are round thing you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either of what's going on I mean that should be one of the biggest stories right now and and who should be reporting this biggest story who should be encouraging that Republicans are they\nNo no no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious I Would think\nThat uh Katherine heritage or or someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work in ...

it back to Nineteen sixty nine or ... and our dealings with the transportation industry as always\nUh had that particular issue bent on economics and so when I saw this today I said okay this is something that we have to bring up so people can understand\nAbout the economy at large it was the wall Street Journal's analysis\nOf Commerce Department statistics out on why we're doing better what is driving the increase in the gross in the GDP in the increase in economic growth what is you know what is driving it and their analysis is almost half\nOf the increase from April of twenty Seventeen from last year until this year now new numbers are coming out this morning but based on the numbers\nThat are that came out from last month almost half of the increase in our economy is due to increased government spending\nAnd they looked at you know really from the majority of the Obama administration where the uh economic uh growth was the average GDP was to point two percent\nAnd compared it to the two point nine percent economic growth that we've had since April twenty Seventeen just under three percent which as you know we know is it is a good thing\nA defense spending has increased drastically that's one of the major reasons and increased government spending that has helped the the GDP\nA defense spending was contracted at an annual rate get this Eric ... to point one percent from two thousand nine to twenty Seventeen ... ... and they really go back to you know the president's real you know the really the first budget when he had no influence on his when looking at right\nOr to growing at a two point nine percent rate since April twenty Seventeen\nSo there's a huge difference in defense spending that turnaround added a point to one percentage points to the ... on average to the nation's overall economic growth rate according to the Commerce Department when a including fast\nSpending on non defense items and spending at state and local levels increase government spending\nAccounted for a point three four percentage point of the point seven percent point increase\nIn the growth rate since April twenty Seventeen\nWhich means uh the economy has grown a two point nine percent uh since April of twenty Seventeen the last quarter was what for for one was ... right or was it was a very good courtroom\nOr almost half of that has been because of government spending if now it has also increased other factors are at play faster business investment due in part to energy investing\nCan trigger point contributed point three percentage points to the growth rate\nFaster consumer spending accounts for about a third of the pick up a slowdown in home building has some attracted two percentage points from that growth rate\nThe concern is as we've said before is wants to government spending moderate than that increase goes away and as we said before the truth grows and if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democrat president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending\nIs viewed the exact same way\nAs private sector profits and sales\nAnd we believe that that distorts the actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the truth expansion of well yes and that's and that is the that is the increase\nIn goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase\nYou see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels which drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP that's still what's driving the majority increase\nEmergency ready products at the all new truck tested dot com website talked

packages at the time Warner center overnight was a false alarm meanwhile to other bombs were found Thursday when the Kenyan report\nA difference there and who knows when now the authorities are saying they're closing or have their focus on Florida and that some of these packages or could have been sent from a facility there in Florida it's only a matter of time before we\nWere in the identity of the the person or persons responsible and that could happen as soon as today\nGiven the the the nature of of of security cameras and how many there are right now in our society or if they know where the facility is than than certainly they may have at least a description as early as even this morning and then by the end of the day who knows maybe and I know\nYou know that's that's a one thing you come to realize that if you walk into any post office in cameras all over the price for those cameras in the parking lot there's cameras in right side there's\nA and and they will know where these things were sent from and then they will go right back through the cameras and people have been caught already on the cameras but there are cameras everywhere these days and\nIt depends on a lot easier to be caught short and it depends I guess the the sophistication of the person or if you look at the the the planning of someone like Ted Kaczynski are now but that was a different situation because those bombs were going off and that was a very dangerous situation and and you know that's the point is that\nYou know where are those those warnings to prove the media from authorities\nTo the public about the nature are sensitive nature possibly of of any of these packages and and how dangerous they would be you know if they were if they were handled or what might trigger them to go off most recently the Austin bombings but when you go back to\nTed Kaczynski and the meticulous planning of a Ted Kaczynski ah during what he did\nA during the Unabomber a phase and he was traveling I mean he was\nTraveling to send those those packages are and of course we learned alternately he was traveling from a remote cabin in the woods you know living basically in this makeshift cabin\nIn the woods and I was very meticulous and his methods\nAnd it took awhile through his through his writings actually hit through his manifesto to kind of breakdown who he was based on the language that he used\nWell and ... of ... everybody is speculating us to to the to motivation and what we\nAh I think most people look at the situation like this and say okay the motivation is to somebody on the left or that it's somebody in the right who did it or another foreign influence I sought Chuck Todd saying he was\nAfraid that might be the Russians because the Russians again got exactly what they a moderate with the American public which is the American public at each other's throat again I'm paraphrasing he didn't actually don't use those words and as we said actually we don't need the Russians to do it [laughter] yeah ... yeah everybody knows we don't need the Russians to\nTo do that but again it's a is it somebody who is a bad bomb maker is this somebody who uh you know decided to\nUh send it because he is a supporter a of a more of the of of the right wing\nAnd and uh you know just hates everybody on the left ... uh and it's just a bad bomb maker or is it somebody who uh\nYou know again sent it from the left as a false flag\nOr in order to make it seem like\nIt was somebody who was doing that now we know the fake uh hate crimes that exist remember after the the the president was elected and remember all the fake hate crimes that happened the ... got national news and I believe almost every single one of them was fake ... all the huge stories that came out about\nA ... hate crimes from supporters ended up being fake right and so we know people will uh will do it look we look at the cabinet and the fat Grassley going after and saying look\n... and sweating to glide mhm we're going out to where we are I Believe we should prosecute them because I Believe that they they lied what is the extent that people will do it we don't know I mean we're we're we're we are in New territory as to people willing to become sacrificial lambs\n... and ... and I think it's important to look at the uh dynamics of either possibility politically like if it's somebody who supports Trump\nOr the dynamics of that the ultimately it potentially could hurt Republicans in Trump if it is if it's found that it is someone that support struck again potentially\n... but if you look at the other side being the false flag or being someone who is liberal and is sending it out and is doing it in an effort to make the the uh the the administration Republicans in general\nUh but but you I think you have to look at it certainly a Trump himself especially look bad that would be\nThe the attempt right it's\nDepending on who the person is it's likely not going to do I guess politically much damage one way or the other except for the fact that you add I think on the left\nThe behavior on the left here recently\nWhen you have Maxine Waters get in their face every opportunity you have the ah Ted Cruz being shouted out of a restaurant you have Hillary Clinton saying we can't be civil civil with the other side until we win at Central me that's what she said it's impossible to be so we\nWe play these individually played Michael Moore from yesterday on MSNBC when asked should we turn down the rhetoric he says no on our side we have to wrap it up for it so uh you know and plus we also must consider the mentally unstable person\nAnd somebody who was just doing it and really not even thinking politically but it's clearly that there's some kind of political aspect to it but not putting as much as we might think than to we're not\nGoing to stop mhm as it as a nation of free speech stopped going to stop no justice or body knows did it stop\nOr after the attempted assassination of Republican congressmen on a baseball field or did as it ratcheted up in a way if we go to the Michael Moore comment that we played earlier\nWhereas on MSNBC with everything going on as a time to ratchet it now it's time for our side to wrap it up so it's not it's not going to stop it doesn't stop in a society that has free speech\nLike we have it is and go now you need to pointed out you also have to understand why people use it mhm and that's why we upstate and we we spend a lotta time this week saying\nThat I don't want people that have great with my position to be used in that type of rhetoric right why number one I don't believe it's the right thing to do ... number two they do use it because\nThey need to do it they had no other outlet they don't have the substance of the ideas of with them they have to do it they feel they need to do it because they don't believe that they can convince anybody any other way except touch threatened them and intimidate them we don't need to do that when I say we\nAre I mean people that believe in the conservative philosophy you don't need to do that no no you can when you can win them over with logic and common sense the reason that a Claire McCaskill says she is separating herself from the crazy Democrats\n\nIs because she realizes that ... I've got to come across as somebody who is a common sense critical thinking person because that's what will attract\nYou know the the the the people out there if I Pretend that high a critical thinking person and don't align myself with the crazy Democrats than people are more likely to accept me that's how you get the independence as we said you're not going to convince\nYou're not going to convince a loyal Republican devout Democrat you're not going to convince a loyal Democrat to vote Republican it's those people in the middle that you are trying to get the Democrats believe the only way to get them is to intimidate them with fear\nWe don't as conservatives we don't need they need to do it because they have no other and I'm coming from their point of view [laughter] they need to do it because they can't back up the ideas\nRight I I I think it will be interesting to see what happens the developments you and I've been watching and monitoring the uh\nThe uh uh all the news agencies overnight a and to see if there's any movement there with this new focus on forward and and the possibility that a ... in terms of the authorities believing that at least some of these packages were sent through a a post office there in Florida\nIn the in the coming hours I think in an over the weekend or possibly you're going to see this this story kind of play out once the authorities again once they find that location they won't be long before we were on the identity ... and again that could be as soon as today\nA or at least have a description of the person then after that assuming that the person is is a is captured in and and taken into custody or live it's quite possible we could learn a lot more about the motivation of the person even if they aren't taken alive\nIf we learn the identity often you go to their social media page or something like this and you see a history of maybe comments that were made and you can see their political ... of ...\nIssue but if we learn that motivation I don't know what changes about the election right now because you look at the bigger things right um\nOpening your mouth or opening your wallet\nBecause just a simple cleaning can cost a hundred fifty dollars\nI think like root canals can cost you hundreds more\nIf you don't have dental insurance to help compositions mutual insurance company\nEight hundred eight nine three zero three two two\nThis isn't a discount plant or preventive only coverage this is real dental insurance that help pay for checkups right away so you can call today and get your teeth cleaned tomorrow plus it helps cover the more extensive procedures you might need down the road feelings grounds bridges even costly dentures there's no deductible and no and you will maximum\nYou're acceptance is guaranteed for one of these insurance policies\nCall now for a free information with all the details one eight hundred\nEight nine three zero three two two\nThat's one eight hundred eight nine three zero three two to\nEight nine three zero three two two\nThat are lined with Dr Sanjay Gupta because you're back in school and the weather's getting cooler [noise]\nHow many of your kids have gotten sick so far this year I'm Dr Sanjay Gupta scene in the medical correspondent on average elementary school kids get six to eight cold every school year high school kids about half\nThat's according to the docks at Johns Hopkins kids are most likely to get\nColds in the fall and winter in large part because they spend more time indoors we're germs are festering\nCold viruses also love the most humidity this time of the\nHead of the perfect storm to make you sick\nOr the most important things you can do to keep your kids healthy is make sure they get enough sleep\nThat means nine to twelve hours a night for elementary school\nKids eight to ten hours for high school kids of course you should also teach them to sneeze into their album cover their mouths when they cough and wash their hands wash their hands wash their hands really does make a huge difference on Dr Sanjay Gupta helping you live a better life\nAre veterans were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life [noise] let them know weekend joining me as a pro supporter of our veterans Hi this is Joe Montana and on the one hundredth anniversary of Veterans Day help no vet alone improve the lives\nOf those who have served our country\nPlease show your support and text V.
