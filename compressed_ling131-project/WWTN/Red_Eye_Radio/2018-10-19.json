members and nobody can figure out why people are going crazy\nYou know you bring up Trump or whatever and it's just like it's like a trick word that a a mining\nProgramming like they did the old shows they had back in the seventies whatever you know they so they call somebody on the phone and say a special word they'll go kill somebody I advocate in anything like that or I'm saying is when\nAbout six seven years ago my daughter wanted me to go with her to the hunting through federal which is a big arena and said Ohio and uh it was about to interview for a job now the new dance club that was opening up in Toledo and so I took her and they'll\nPretty much still two thirds theory or filled up with families kids and parents editor for was a panel of um people probably six people they each have their little steel to talk about this new dance club that was coming into the going all around the country opening up these clubs and\nThe thing that struck by interests first of all was their pictures didn't get paid by the hour they got paid by how many other kids they brought in\nNow there are five hundred families in this arena there is no way a little club is going to hire all these people but what they were doing was trying to bring the kids in and as I listen to this bill I save told on their cells by saying\nIt will be music playing and food and then at throughout the night there'll be certain times what the musical stop it will have announcements and it was or political announcements\nSo these people in your family especially you know what you're thinking about Twenty years old twenty two year olds watch a lot of these people and people and and people that are out there in the streets blocking the streets these kids have been a doctor dated almost like it's a cult and\nYou know if it was his ... who's got the money to raise the Huntington center\nFor this club\nNow I tried to get in there to find out more about it and I told my play drums which I Do and uh I like to get in and sometimes the kids like the answer to the extra beat suicide twelve years ago they had that and not so I could get inside the walls to find out exactly what was happening but I've never heard back from them but this\nThese people that your family members do\nEven though you see that have come out in the heart do hate that it's not their fault and then if you had a family member that was due to a cult and they're not only programs that's basically what it is I mean if I like blue and he like red we can discuss it and there's not a titled\nOr whatever it gets into the area of control of the population\nThen you see the anger come out that because I I really believe there are programs by son is thirty one right now but she was a Jew in junior high\nBack was a Gore and Bush was bad was down in Florida he said dad who you voted for and back then I just you know I didn't care about politics I almost I didn't vote for nobody 'cause they're all crooks\nHe was a well we had a mock election that school and Gore won by a landslide them thinking wow I don't know a whole lot by\nPretty sure that guy's really it\nSo I started listening AM radio and I don't know what a Democrat is or a conservative or a Democrat or anything I mean I don't know anything about anything\nSo I mean you have an open mind as it didn't take me long to figure out that I was a conservative\nAnd even back then the hatred was prominent in the discussion on the talk shows that were more of a liberal democratic side and what I what I've just seen as just\nAs I feel sorry my heart goes out to everybody you know I was driving a truck with my brother\nYears ago and started talking politics and he you know I bring up a point of fact and he didn't have any say he got mad started calling me a warmonger\nI'm like is that all you got is just name calling was basically that's all they've got they have no choice that makes sense you know how can you not understand\nIt's better to have people working to have the economy's doing better that low unemployment and all these things that are common sense but\nThey just you can't get through to them there's a mental problem there is there's a programming problem I Believe my heart\nSo I Can't say that I wanted to let you know\nWell he did a good job Charlie and I think it's more emotionally although you here I never thought of that so the Democratic party as a cult cult of a motors because that's what they do most of the people there I'm not saying that Brian I'm not saying that a nice a lot of them they ... there's no issue about that\nAnd there's many you know nice Republicans I assume it's Democrats and vice versa\nBut the fact is that a lot of it's based on emotion like you said he always a liar oh he's a racist wait what about the economy what about foreign policy what about the countries in really good shape in terms of things people care about they often vote their pocketbooks\nNo he's he's just how could you like him he's he's just a small you know this was to have a person I've ever met\nAnd if you and if you do like um I'm not going to date you I'm not going to talk to you I'm going to be fringe on Facebook\nIt's incredible shots you you know the reason I I laugh at this point 'cause otherwise you cry I mean you hear these stories\nAbout people losing their friends and their family and uh it's

United States which you like about you know we've seen numbers around fifty percent\nThat's still about three to four billion people around the world that want to come to the United states and again and one of our focus is just is not just the impact\nThat legal immigration house on America wage earners and job prospects here in the United states but it's also on future sustainability you know we're already looking at a water crisis out west or half of the United states and magic adding another billion with a population of the United states what kind of water crisis we would have that [noise]\nAnd at the time when I suggested this I was thinking\nI visualize the the uranium ... testers of course it done by the government were yelling death to America death to America\nAnd I said what if I put a cargo plane down in the middle tell you her in ... and said this is your one chance to get them or if you and I visualize them just dumping their placards and running on the plane because again America still represents the ... the promise of freedom\nAnd liberty and everything you want to talk about that so we we we have to recognize that because in that then applies to places like Mexico and elsewhere just because they can walk in doesn't give them any more right to stay here than people who may be waiting ten years to get into the country\n[laughter] exactly yeah and that's you know again again going back to your initial question we support legal immigration we obviously support people coming through the legal channel not coming here illegally but we also support\nControls the legal immigration system you know you go back and he looks route America's history we had the great wave at the end of the end of a\nNineteen century the turn of the century but really that was a different time I mean when you go back and you look at that America was rapidly expanding we moving westward we were in the middle of ... or building or building roads and and and uh\nYou know railroad tracks in the country was just expanding so quickly I think of that but I saw was that GDP was doubling basically every three years in the United states\nUm but we were bringing people in at a rate of about nine hundred thousand to a million per year\nOver the last Fifteen to Twenty years we've been bringing people in that roughly the same rate even a little bit higher this past year fiscal year twenty Seventeen we bought in one way to go about our economy not expanding as quickly as it was during the great wave but if you go back and you look at the time\nBetween the end of World War two and and really Nineteen Ninety One at all changed uh you look at that time period and that's the time or the country built the strongest\nMost stable middle class that that the world has ever seen before and the average immigration rate during that time period was about three hundred and fifty thousand so again and we'd like to reduce illegal immigration from its current level of about one point one million down to you know at least five hundred thousand\nIt and and and just see you know what kind of an impact on our economy we believe that would have a positive impact not just on our economy wages wages go up here in the United\nStates I mean it's amazing the unions and the left the don't support you in that aspect at least what do you think of people like Ann Coulter suggest we should take a pause in legal immigration to get this thing fix than straightened out [noise]\nThere there have been a lot of suggestions like that throughout throughout\nThe years and it's in the early Nineteen nineties I said it all changed around Nineteen Ninety though is the immigration activists Nineteen Ninety that really exploded legal immigration to the point that we're at now and in the early nineties when we saw the ramping up a legal immigration we saw go from bringing in roughly\nFour or five hundred thousand people are here during the\n... the Nineteen eighties to more than a million ... here in the early nineties area we'd\nDo as a representative at the time before he moved over to the Senate became Senate majority leader he actually introduced a bill that called for an immigration or actually\nStart Democrats calling from or tournaments on immigration so\nWe actually as an organization called for an immigration oratory him back in two thousand and one of the stock market crashed and and we had the huge jobs crisis when millions of people losing their jobs every school bus but we didn't think it was wise policy ...\nPrinting yet more than a hundred and fifty thousand workers every single unpleasant when a million Americans jacket picture that\nMakes sense to us so we called for one back that\nNow under current circumstance or\nYou know the economy's doing pretty well we're creating strong number of jobs about a hundred and fifty thousand jobs\nAround but again for bringing more than a hundred and fifty thousand foreign workers every single month for still bringing in ... in the army is creating for jobs so I don't think we need a full tore him but again I think I think if we made some changes like like what front or it's ... and David courteous suggested in\nThe White House has mentioned entertain migration as it is a lottery that would at least reduce legal immigration by about three to four hundred thousand I think that would have a huge impact I don't know for necessarily at a point\nWhere we need a full Laura ... but certainly I think if your side Ghana and other jobs crisis like we had about ten years ago and that that a moratorium should be considered\nIt is interesting theory talked about Harry Reid the changing but he wasn't the only one Hillary whoever you want to mention and the American public needs to hear this maybe through your your decision or other political leaders that these guys are all on the other side they did you do with the wind when a benefits them politically or power was\nYeah and in fact the the immigration act of Nineteen Ninety part of that that there was a lot of concern is that it would have the actual impact that it did and not that's exploding legal immigration up to one point I Want more than one million new legal immigrants per year so one of the things that they they\nAdded into legislation was that after a few years there will be a bipartisan rational commission that would review the impacts of the legislation and make recommendations based on what was happening after passage of a law so that led to Bill Clinton is\nObviously a Democrat created this bipartisan commission and the Nineteen nineties any assigned Barbara Jordan the former and and nobody would accused Barbara Jordan and hurt democratic regret credentials as the chairwoman of of that bipartisan congressional commission and the joy of commission recommended\nA what we we advocate for today is it\nCalled for ending chain migration and ending the visa lottery reducing legal immigration to their recommendation was three years that down to about five hundred fifty thousand which at that time the current level was about a million which is around the words that today so so there was bipartisan support for this\nBut you had a huge push over the years especially in the early years in the in the mid to late nineties you had a huge\nPush from big business U.S Chamber of commerce groups like that that that always want more workers because they look at us as as a a a\nSupply and demand issue if you have a large pool of labor than you can keep wages lower it's just simple a gas price supply and demand\nType type theory I'm\nSo ... you had the big business groups pushing for more immigration and in the mid to late Nineteen nineties but then you start to see more of a special interest groups the immigration attorneys um some of the\nSome of the um uh some of the more ethnic base groups after the two thousands start to get a take a large interest in in legal immigration naturally when you started to see a shift in the Democratic party\nWell so that you know I during the week I've been mentioning so you had the conspiracy not a conspiracy but then mutual

Albert in Lakewood, California you're on with mark and with Chris\nYes hello yes we're hearing okay if I can uh\nWell Mark I wanted to get up about it after you might want to get stuck with you and I wanted to ask you why should why should we be responsible for another country's problems with each other with a refugee with gangs and grab you can never they and they want to come up here and now some of them are ...\nStories are made up and make up stories just to get in here\nBe being called ... a refugee why does why is it are proud of them living in theory but you're you're you're at you're okay\nSure but I'm going to the being lucky enough have Chris here although I my simple answer is we shouldn't be but let's see what Chris has to say from numbers usa [noise]\nRight right you know in the last segment where you were talking about that\nBut if if you if you asked everybody in the wall who wants to cover that wants to cut the United states the number would probably be about three to four billion um there there's no way we can take in the world's poor it's it's it's just not going to happen so good you know due to allow the lucky few and those countries to get out to commit or\nDo you do what's better for everybody and and and to try to help those countries out there are people in their home countries so it's it's the second option that we support so um\nYou know we don't think we can solve the world's problems by by just allowing everybody to come to the United states so yeah my my answer would be let's help them there instead it's it's a lot more effective and it's a lot more cheap and I think it's a lot of beneficial for all of us now for\n... the caravan that's heading our way of they can only be a ... ... refugees um that they would be they would actually be considered a ... if they enter the United states some enclave asylum so they can only claim asylum if they actually get\nInto the United states so you know my first\nMy first advice if I could advised the Trump Administration will be don't let them in the country if they can't get in the country and they can't claim asylum show\nDo whatever you can I think I think the actions so far to the administration has taken by by a pleading wave by threatening foreign aid for Honduras Guatemala El Salvador\nIt go and say hey we're not going to give you your foreign aid if you allow this caravan just to come on obstructed up to the United\nStates and and it looks like it hasn't worked to too much with the Central American countries but Mexico is these giving me appearance that that they're going to try to stop this caravan from from reaching the U.S Mexico border um that they're taking it fairly seriously at least they're giving an impression that they're taking\nIt very strict barely seriously so off to see what actually happens when they when they reach Mexico's southern border and want to gain entry into into Mexico\nTo get up to the United states but again that the caller was absolutely right what they're going to try to do is they're going to try to game our asylum system once they get here they're either going to try to\nGet in illegally undetected or they're going to come through a um a port of entry and claim asylum or when they if they do try to come in illegally undetected but get detecting apprehended by\nBorder patrol then they'll enter their asylum sleep by defensive asylum plate but again they can enter an asylum plea unless they get into the United states so my recommendation is\nKeep 'em outside of the United states see it from Mexico will allow us to move our asylum educators and say okay if you seriously want to consider or as a ... here in the United states than what we'll do is we'll send our asylum educators\nTo you will hear your case and then we'll only allow you into the United states if you pass through the initial tests which is a credible fear test but I think\nAgain ... you won't want to relax when we both agree wait a second is marked Albert you want to read but when we both agreed with you [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "19"}
