I Would love to ask left is a well they wouldn't let some liberals at least is this what you want\nThat someone accused you of something\nI mean even though he doesn't ... against the Tucker Carson Carlson saying on Fox News that he's been accused of something I don't know what that was when he was totally innocent people like that but your life is ruin your member of the players at at Duke lacrosse players they wound up in unison remember to wanna Brawley in New York City\nOr a with Al Sharpton who never had to apologize for all of that stuff [noise]\nThis is what you want where you can just destroy someone's life\nAnd in their family because of an accusation that's not corroborated and people are believed just because you make an accusation in the in the me too movement\nWe understand women having been treated fairly and in many years in our country but the idea that that's that's enough as a what's the Hawaiian ... senators name that that's you know mentioned just shut up and go way\nThat's where we've come to I've set for years now give me nine conservative odd black women on the U.S Supreme Court and I'd be happy camper what do I care about their race\nOr their gender I just one people with good values and of course I Want them to share my views what went on and I hear him getting into that wanted to get into it later when we're on a week or so ago is just outrageous but then it brings me to my bigger picture which I talked about the first hour that we have a civil war\nThe left believes that they have truth on their side and anything they do is justified so much so you can't speak on college campuses you can't even go to a restaurant in peace now right\nAnd they'll do anything and everything to get rid of President Trump and Hillary say this week something about we will not be civil again\nAnd we don't have to be civil as long as he's president of the United states whoa we we've gotten to that point of view I remember that Ronald Reagan would have drinks with these days you cannot drinks when Tip O'Neill at night\nAnd he's in front of the regular season and say you were battling me in the daytime and Tip O'Neill the Democrat the speaker of the house from Massachusetts would say well that was the daytime we fight there but here we're friendly that that's not the case anymore\nYou saw what Senator Graham said\nThat he wouldn't put up with this nonsense and you want power so badly you'll do anything\nTo destroy people yeah that's where we've come now\nWe've come to a point where it sounds like a second civil war to me and you see the anti for the protests in the street and Portland I mentioned that last hour what took place between the prayer group and their group\nAnd bloody and bare knuckles and bear spray and all kinds of stuff it's it's getting violent out there and of course we have the situation of these ... these\nAre almost being murdered by a guy who you know shut up the congressmen and playing baseball that's all we've come to I I really worry about this country it is really crucial and if you\nDon't vote come the what is it about four weeks from now I don't even know what it is in early November and the Democrats take back the house and that's the protection\nOf a lot of so called polls now and of course the polls wrong before so I'm hoping for a bigger turnout on our side\nYou will you won't believe what's going to take place they'll have hearings half the hearings they'll subpoena people it won't be safe to work for the Trump Administration anymore they'll catch on something and they'll get you on everything\nSo this can't be this can't be what you want to happen in America even good liberals on the other side I Wish you'd call me\nAt eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine you can't want this because just like the reason we now only need fifty votes to elect the Supreme Court justice or fifty one and the vice president votes in case of the pie is because Harry Reid started that\nYou know the Democrats the left and liberals can't want this 'cause it's kind of come back to haunt them and the next time they win and in American history\nIt goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans and on one side and the other side you you can't want that's the problem is you're you're not seeing you open up a new can of worms where you are guilty\nJust because of an accusation you open up a new can of worms if you will do anything to get rid of the press in the United states because you disagree their views and Trump's case even worse\nYou know like who he is a you personally so post him\nYou can't believe this ... this bump came this full this guy is not an elite is like the rest of you that he ever could have one and by the way\nHe's going to win again I really believe that the election was held today not two years a long time he'd win reelection\nSo as ... we're we're in for a battle and we've got to make sure that the the house has not taken over by the Democrats I'm pretty sure we're going to keep the Senate and we're probably when a few more seats in the Senate but in the house of representatives they a lot of people I I did a show\nA week or so ago and I had some experts on the third our including off the air they said to me it looks bath house represents\nThe guy that I Know well in orange county part of California data roar back I think he's been at twenty or Thirty years he's in trouble they're spending millions and millions of dollars to defeat him didn't and then they are so passionate about this the other side\nThey are so angry about this election this past election that President Trump is in office to get what he's done and remember the courts were so significant because if they couldn't win elections the other side would make sure judges ruled right\nLike the Muslim ban that President Trump because of what he said some federal judges decided it was a Muslim ban it doesn't matter if the president has a right to do that so they love the idea that the judges could make laws\nThat's partially what this battle was about also\n[noise] so I listen to that's what the first hour was and I want you to react to it I think we're going to another civil war going on I'm just hoping that it doesn't get violent that we can get through this thing and I'd already there is a lot it's a major and you can't go to a\nRestaurant that would have been on heard of ten twenty Thirty years ago going to a restaurant with your family and having people chant around you to make sure you can eat there or having a waiter or waitress is not serving police or not serving people on the other side what what are we coming to does the other side really want that [noise]\nSo ...

of my friends are but they do understand what the media is trying to get people to see and the way that they are presenting it and it it's definitely outright like I said I I don't really put myself

new\nAnd it doesn't matter who they destroy and there's no negotiating with these people it is their way or the highway I had trouble watching a ... a couple of weeks ago the Kevin out here is I don't go to tie the some of the civil war now even though it's my job as a talk show host to watch that circus\nThey didn't really care about that woman not really she was used as pawns senator Booker because those on your side would have ignored a conservative woman with the same charges against a left this man\nAnd you're accomplices in the media would barely cover it need I mentioned Kathleen Willie Paula Jones Anita Broderick in more some you hope remember some of these names and these women weren't on the left so it doesn't matter they accuse\nYou know of all kinds of a sexual assault there just these women are just road kill on their way to power the absolute Parker sea of people like Cory Booker talking about sexual molestation\nI'm surprised they didn't have another Spartacus moment didn't he admit and an operator or something sexual misbehavior or the self righteousness of Kamala Harris or the other phone is on the panel\nThey talk about taking the moral high ground these hypocrites have actually reach new lows let alone the moral high ground every time I think they can go no lower he break new ground that's the kind of work they can't go to a new ground\nTell me how you're able to contain herself I I had trouble continue myself during those weeks that week whatever ... more than a week actually with the delay eight six six nine to read I eight six six nine o seven three thirty three thirty nine [noise]\nThese people disgusts me I Can't watch or listen to them Kavanaugh was not even my first choice to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nThey could have picked for example the pope\nAnd he's a leftist but they would have been against him if President Trump had appointed him why in heck did they even need hearings or further FBI investigations when they announced how they were going to be voted on very few exceptions\nAnswer to soccer and people like Jeff Flake\nTalking about it I'm sure people said that I'm not the only one to talk about being named correctly by the way he said he would vote for cabinet are having a he was all set to but it did you see this historical woman confronted him in the elevator\nAnd he admitted that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake is a fool and this delay did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us\nThis was all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham had adjust right\nThis is all about power and I could take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge you want to wish they would it be honest about that\nBut they're a bunch of phony hypocrite hypocritical leftists they discussed me tell me what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that\nBecause we have now taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have proper ending evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the accused doesn't important\nBecause you have to prove they did it with mouse if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan's secretary of labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me\nHe was asked after he was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like\nWhere do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein senator funds have the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do Senate Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life\nAct ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have I Would have let them it wears his bank account for all the good work he's done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay as president after what he did\nWith the complicity of you Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war I Want to know what you think eight six six nine to read I\nMatched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chest a second time I'm very fortunate to I think she was attacked yes\nAppears credible in that regard to judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was the fact I don't know exactly what happened\nAnd whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies in her story she doesn't actually got there how she got home when it was exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we reached the stage where all you need are allegations so what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't want\nAnd ruining everybody's reputation in the process now there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused of cues and accused\nIt's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked\nThanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flicking least voted for it\n[noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she does I think there's some movement or recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of bills fools who allow this process to take place looked by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin uh same can be yours with a flick of your cell phone\nDo the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nTo remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous\nSenator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling is with Joe Biden said he witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith and fairness and justice that binds the country together\nIs he getting that's a Democrat play book and Mitt Romney or another genius I mean I was a delegate for and by the way I've got to make and full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week\nAnother example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point do you have to know how to fight them\nI was going to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you surname my top your list the special after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically league Christine forms accusations against capita just days before a committee vote\nI think it was here the ... are you confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for a referred to a lawyer hosts George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week\nAnd what a chance of she spelled spotted all of these things would go do not focus on what we should be focusing which has the credibility of judge Kavanaugh she responded before calling Kavanaugh's claims of political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShe didn't answer and stuff like that to me and her and she goes on and by the way even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nBy the way she her own and has suggested Kevin did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right you don't deserve the process of being a a\nA proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated forward but you used her you and your masters and deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love what Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone then find science officer wanna Ford's attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to leak the harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said\nIt was actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they to her left the script before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nThe ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of bread Kevin up they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there are\nPlease show your support and text V.

Bush or said that uh you know they'll get forty percent they can get up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote and I thought oh forty percent you still lose every time but you're on to something really significant which is the black vote and President Trump said Romney got six percent I think Trump got eight percent\nOr if we start to get more of the black vote on the Republican side the Democrats are in huge trouble because they've counted on that Ninety percent Ninety three Ninety Ninety five sometimes you know what I buy my God I think it was way up there they count on that\nIf ever they lose an interesting percentage of that even the Jewish population they they started to go the other way they the Republicans now started diving get twenty five thirty percent [noise]\nThey're in trouble ... big trouble as you suggest that\nIf they can't count on of those votes and they shouldn't shouldn't get those votes the Democrats have controlled every city just about every major city every major school district and think about the last thirty forty years how the schools have\nA function of how well they've been doing I'm saying that in the opposite direction they're not doing well or how well our cities are doing\nAnd you come to the conclusion what if the Democrats tons of people living in the inner city and that's a real issue if ever the Democrats lose that vote there in huge trouble and Donald Trump has many you choke\nI and I was just right away I knew right away this last year so far I mean she just from outer space and actually\nShe just she and then they right away as like you know ... fifty seven yeah you get to the old people it's like I mean she was so full of you know what I just can't believe anybody could have believed there for ... to ...\nWell a lot of people thought she was credible 'cause you you know she had that childlike voice and she seems sympathetic and I can I be sure that none of this happened I'm I'm not even talking my cat on a\nBut I was saying can I be sure that she was an attack by someone could chief fantasize that all that stuff maybe [noise]\nUm yeah it's suspicious but a lot of people don't want to talk about it for many years to come so\nIt's just unclear I who you know I I Can't be sure that you make of that stuff up\nWell\nYou know you you saw a picture of her ... year book and she looked I looked like an ice kid like an awesome the only child young girl and you think of something or and a half and you think she would have been on it like you know like the next day that night she would have probably told somebody [noise]\nUm so I think is just about to me I mean just stay right away like a non starter\nYeah but you know it's hard to read someone's motivation and many people say been through that that you don't want to say anything to embarrass you feel guilty whatever I just try to be fair on this thing ah someone got me on the letter of the national show that I was on and said mark look at you saying she was credible well [noise]\nI don't know I I just try to think of what the average person out there watching his thinking and uh she seems certainly sympathetic cried\nA site I if\nWant to take the position that people on my side or you know always telling the truth and the other side is not you're going to get in trouble you got to look at it the way an average person looks at somebody Susan Collins from Maine senator was so good I didn't expect her to do the she did everything factually and went over everything in her speech for our\nTax fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.

sure yes thank you for taking my call yes and you can you hear me I can okay\nOh what's that show but I think it was\nOver a year that they get on with all\nThe junk out of course it ended up getting checked like Trump said it would and I know many many lawyers and people you get in there and to ...\nAge ... what after this case\n... cheap oil there had to pay ... dollars any\nSketch twelve ended at ... like 'cause you get drunk said I Would like to know exactly how much that call start taxpayers to it\nAll that and I kind of letter to the far left is so worried about getting in there and staying because they've had ... along\nThe light of day it started as a\nLast chance to get a lengthy pockets before they go out because I really have a well how much did that did that actually the ... catalog caused our taxpayer dollars to it all those attorneys each state will hold office that are\n... dogs high leg what it cost ... dollars I Would really\nYeah I I'm Sorry I thought you'd finish your thought so I Apologize to your um we have a lot of calls I Want to try to get to them I think it was more about power and money goes along with that of course I I'd be\nDisingenuous if I didn't admit that but there was even some talk that SARS pay some of the George Soros paid some of those demonstrators certainly at the cabinet hearings\nUm money yeah money's a part of it much much more about power about which way this country is going to go is it going to go and her left forward direction\nWe're going to be true to our founding a constitutional republic and a a government that tries to for the most part just do what's absolutely necessary to stay out of people's lives\nThat's what I think the real battle about and maybe in of course money's include look at the Clintons how can I denied that right they became rich with the Clinton Foundation selling a you know access for millions of dollars I don't think that the Clinton Foundation is making much money anymore so they know they're not there although\nI I never got through it I'll do it tomorrow night um I'd love to see Hillary run again 'cause I I think\nIt would be best them let's go to Amanda in del city Virginia you're on with mark\nMark a treat to talk to you and I I really think that we're winning and I think it's ... um and I think Steve ... is a good example of how we overcome horrible attacks and then\nThey're seen as hero because I I just think he is one of the brain as people I've ever seen and I also think\nPresident Trump and I'm Brett Kavanaugh are a very brave people and I was so upset by what happened to break Cavanaugh I decided you know what can I Do to fight back against us um and one of those things that I've decided to do is\nI Will take away the laughs ability to communicate in any way I can and I talk to people and I challenge them on their views I also um have removed guard signs in my neighborhood that I disagree with because\nIf they're going to steal people's honor and trash people's reputation and I I I I can allow them to advertise the main my neighborhood to promote themselves\nYeah but I don't think you want to take away the yard signs 'cause you could get personal trouble\nForget what the ramifications that I Know I've been saying that we got to fight the way they fight and so on but I don't want to see you give them any trouble is legal to do that and you're lucky to be you that's caught taking down the arts on it so I I don't want to do that it's not the way to do with ... on your side\nHere and I understand what you're saying and I you know I I I take great precautions to make sure that I'm not seeing but the the thing is is that I have seen Republicans ... run over and destroy and\nRight in front of my audience and so is that there was a a gentleman who drove across or more in right in front of the um who we Maryland a Republican office drove I think thirty feet across the grass and tried to run over a sign\nWith his car\nAnd we were sitting there watching it happen and you know it it just blows my mind that you know that someone could do something like that and then there's driveway and no one does anything to him you know\nAnd I I yeah I live in California and I wouldn't put a Trump sign up on my car that'd be the end of my car there were key the car this hotel about him here and I wouldn't put it in order to rely on that I mean\nYeah yeah I saw that guy with the black pickup truck that had his car firebomb because he had a make America great bumper sticker on car you know they wrote after Trump on his car and spray paint and then broke the window and set the interior on fire\nAnd I just I I just know where winning when they feel they have to do something like that you know and he ... his Democrats and we see them sending things on fire so we know that they're desperate and I I guess\nThey have nothing to offer except for outrage and protest and you need more than that is a political party to be effective and ... it's just ridiculous you know I've been listening to talk radio for more than Twenty years I read books you know written by conservative people\nUm like Rush Limbaugh and mark for men and and and I know more about politics than most people so when I can print a liberal about their belief I can I can combat them with facts that I have on my side and I think if we educate ourselves by reading these books you know and and\nThe only two um cities towels Web sites you know ... to lie dot com and and and reading her story about how these um\nStates attorneys and I'm judges were breaking the law in order to um vilify and spy on Republicans and you know once people know these things in the dirty tricks\nTo check that Democrats are up to and I I just can't see how anybody would vote for them and\nI think that they're terrified also that President Trump has become um attractive to the African American community and out and out of black Americans\nAre having a more stable of viewing the him um and I think you know it's over twenty five percent now and they need eighty five percent of the African American votes wins\nOn no they need like Ninety percent or a few percent yeah like a huge difference\nUm yeah so there's a lot of hope it no you may not have been listening all night but there's a lot of frustration out there and I think the Democrats overplay their hand and the Kavanaugh hearings ... trying to destroy this guy even if they want some merit to her case that's not the point\nPoint they just want to be with you in presumed innocent\nOr we just had some interruption there go get your call if that's what it was a great call uh I think I'm I'm getting more optimistic after doing the show tonight and I'll be we'd all we\nAre filling in for the guys um I I think they overplay their hand and Republicans are going to come out in huge numbers and maybe we will not lose the house let's go to Thomas in Knoxville, Tennessee you're on with mark\nAnd mark
