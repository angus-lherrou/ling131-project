Ninety nine seven WGN\nEr let's rewind the tape together would you please the two days ago we read that George Soros received a some kind of device in a mailbox on his property could tone of the very next day that was yesterday Soros is a speech saying Trump will be gone by twenty twenty or sooner the very next day\nJust today for bombs are said none of them go off and we're supposed to buy this whole I don't believe a word of this I don't believe the whole thing is just like out of a textbook for for children see I'm a South Carolina Michael you'll be the last quarter of the day what's on your mind go ahead please\n... and it was like it would be worthwhile for somebody to investigate the profits today by the uh the downfall of the stock market was also very interesting that your answer the lady that you met from Hungary and are hungry for history with her openness\nAnd George Soros or just ... feet from their\nWell did you what you're implying is that the market collapsing today because of the bomb threats went down six hundred you're asking him George Soros who makes his money by collapsing economies short sold yesterday isn't that what you're suggesting\nUh yeah for for\nMichael here's the problem Soros no longer has a publicly traded fund Soros removed all of his funds into a private fun so nobody actually knows what he is doing in the stock market Michael isn't that convenient\nExactly\nI'm sending you a copy of stop mass hysteria because I Will tell you people what you're seeing today with this narrative about the pipe bombs is a classic example of mass hysteria being induced by the left\nThey're all calling themselves victims they're all attacking Trump they're all attacking conservatives and noticed you no longer talking about the march of the\nUh people from Honduras you're not talking about what they did to cabinet or two things that blew up on them they had two bombs go off already the Kavanaugh hearings thanks to Dianne Feinstein set them back a couple of points\nThe march from on doors shut them back major league even with Democrats so that they come up with this that's my opinion to this point in\nMy opinion is fluid however because as a scientist I Am open to evidence and if the evidence changes tomorrow and new evidence appears I Will say okay I was wrong in my assumption yesterday\nThe or understand how the how logic works do you understand how a a trial works do you understand how science works\nAs of now I have no reason to believe the narrative that is being put forward by the American left because they lie about everything\nThen you saw this morning that Cuomo the governor of New York said yeah yeah I got one to turned out he never got the ball and he had to have one too\nSo the whole thing so far leaves me skeptical I don't believe a ward of it but again we'll have to see what happens tomorrow maybe someone will be drug up and brought forward and they'll say yes I did it and I voted for Trump and I were America hat\nAnd the reason I did it is because I was told it to no good by talk show host why things should be indicted that could happen tomorrow for God Forbid one of us on the conservative side could get a bomb sent to us it will go off and ... you don't know what tomorrow will bring doing [noise]\n\nHammering [noise]\nKeep your talking about it we're talking about we're talking Ninety nine

New Jersey outbreak primarily a friend says President Trump went ahead with this rally in Wisconsin ones they are so thoroughly searched for a bomber who mailed devices to prominent Democrats and CNN of Constantine the report\nAre absolutely into a boy chance of lock her up regarding Hillary Clinton in central Wisconsin President Trump stuck to his teleprompter for comments regarding the bomb threats even so his rhetoric while muted was aimed at progressive targets such as activists who confronted Republicans in restaurants\nYou can use real people in the end but these aren't real people these are actors right and it's a ... situation it's it's got scripts\nAnd I don't know why people think I don't know why they believe that tactic is effective uh [laughter] I guess they can't actually have clear saying I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\n[noise]\nBecause that has to be said because there's just not that has to be said by somebody else ... well he couldn't say that ...\nThing is that this isn't pac money this isn't something this this here is\nThe ... campaign this was her ad yes it's her she you do hear her voice yet saying I approve this message right so I'm not one of those crazy with Emma crap one of those dating right I'm not one of those crazy Democrats well now\nI ... it it's I think it's horrible in what it's trying to do you know what I'm saying I it's not effective in what they're trying to get done from the ad because it's well it's it's just\nSorry it's contrived the only thing that that I can think of is that their internal polling is showing\nThat independence or leaning Holly's way and one of the reasons is because remember she uses the specific word crazy Democrats well they did it right or some kind of ... there's a reason that you there's a reason that you do that\nThere's ... and and the reason that you do that is because there is a segment of those undecided voters that you're\nGoing after that in your internal polling you have found out they believe\nAnd and I don't know why because I didn't do died I was in privy to the polling could be Kavanaugh could be a you know everything that has gone on it it'd be you know the the going into restaurants disturbing\nYeah Republicans whatever but in order to use that term and words are very important especially words that will alienate your own party in a political ad means OK I'm Still safe from the base the the base Democrats or\nI don't have to worry about them I Need to get those independence and they're leaning Holly's way we believe and one of the reasons is they believe that the Democrat Party and a significant portion of those that represent the Democratic party in Congress\nAre crazy that can be the only reason you don't do that in an ad that I mean could you imagine\nRemembered this isn't even a you can't even say well this is just a house race in a particular area this is the state of Missouri and this is a Senate race mhm\nAnd so inside her campaign which means not just in her campaign but other campaigns\nAcross the country this is something\nThat Democrats who wish to who wish to promote themselves\nAnd pretend to be moderate what they're facing is a significant portion of independence\nWho believed that the Democratic party and members of the Democratic party are crazy way in which shows that everything that has happened in the cabinet thing in going into restaurants is having an effect on independence otherwise they would run the ad\nI think there's I I still think there's an end someone must have and and the research the the voters or whoever was you know of being ah the part of the I I guess group that was being polled\nMust have used those words specifically otherwise it's horrible writing because I think a an ad by a Claire McCaskill or could could or for Claire McCaskill could do the same again we're just talking the politics of it\nBy saying you know look we know that there are there are extremes on both sides and right now yet I I'm not proud of some of the things that are going on in my own party with with within my own party and people that are clearly supporting my own party\n... I Want you to know that I Am not that person I'm a great does it but that that's the\nPoint and that's the great point right there yeah it was specifically using the term crazy Democrats don't want to add a reviews that any Democrat some someone had\nTo have used that in some kind of feedback\nThat they were getting that feedback that it was crazy Democrats not extreme right I'm not part of the extreme of my party because he used that why did why the term crazy Democrats because that's the feedback you been getting back right in your own internal polling\nBecause extreme means that you've gone full on one side in in one direction and and to\nA further extent well no that's not what's going on\nIt it is crazy and and that's the perception what you're trying to you're trying to target with those words the very perception as someone who has given that feedback to you with those words that's the only way that happens that's the only way those words ended up in an ad like that\n\nThey because someone must have made that that's that's where the the word crazy must have appeared in feedback and unlikely multiple times\n\nAnd they're in their internal time and now you're talking about tens of millions of dollars to run a Senate race ... which means they are doing every type of of polling an analytical research you can get you get down to this point here\nAnd you see the desperation of using that in an ad that means you are trying to fight the perception of crazy Democrats in your election in Missouri and\nIt is the one thing that is killing your chances of winning yeah it is the one thing because it is\nIf you think about the build up to you know if you listen to that there is a buildup that word is is is one of those hot button words that you don't expect to hear but it was placed in the ad strategically at a certain place right as you are listening to something and all of a sudden boom\nShe's not one of those crazy Democrats because and there's another thing too it's a poor attempt I think at recreating a conversation that people are\nYou know having out there but it's not that's not the conversation they're actually having the conversation they're having is if it were really I think accurate and and\nAnd portraying what's going on with some of the Democrats or independents interstate\nIt would be two guys going man those Democrats are crazy I don't know that I can vote for Democrats anymore including McCaskill that the actual conversation so you have to have you have to countered with this contrived and and again I think it's a it's a it's a poor attempt\nBut that's the only thing you can do you're not going to get Claire McCaskill coming out going hey I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nOr the other thing I thought was interesting you know and and I'm not you know very familiar with Josh Hawley who's running against the attorney general against\nClaire McCaskill I'm I'm a I'm I'm not you know we live in we live in Texas and that's one of the tough things is\nIt's it's tough for anybody ... ... and I mean it's tough for anybody on the national stage to really have a key understanding of what's going on for example in ... in Missouri raised in many congressional races it's it's really tough because\nA lot of times it can be local and if you're not living there you don't see the stories that are pounded at you\nOr that each and every day but you and I both looked at each other we haven't discussed us but we looked at each other the part where well and it's claimed that\nThat Hawley as attorney general made wine runs and went to the gym during work hours\nPlay ... with\nAll the heated rhetoric yeah an ad use that show you only thing they can make up your own and that was that's what you use and put an ad of desperation well here's the thing\nIt's the same thing oh wait a minute I Wonder if he could pick me up some wine next time he goes because people go to the gym during the day all the time but what's what's the people people run errands all the time just assume OK just to frame right\nThat it's if it's on company time and it's it's well the the the the state time in this case\nAnd it's um it's being done outside of his lunch hour it's not on his time that's the worst she got well I'm assuming most attorney general's don't work eight to five I'm guessing\nThere's I'm assuming you hours I'm assuming there's meetings there's speeches there's everything else that goes line meetings are to me why aren't they going to be a part of a job [laughter] but I I again I don't know the specifics behind it but I just went and and may and that's\nBut from an outsider you heard that and you went that's a pretty weak well for an out of desperation that's pretty weak what it is I Would have a I Would I Would have said\nAgainst ... strategically this is the only thing we're talking about here strategy I Would have stayed on wait a minute he hasn't tried one case yeah the guy just doesn't have the experience he doesn't have the experience of returning\nGeneral for state he certainly doesn't have experience to serve in the Senate the war he went and bought some wine and went to the gym on on a

keeps a growing overnight and then I'm Amazed that we have gotten an email sided may rise we addressed it to start the the the the show a off with but a National Review and it's being picked up by\nYou know I'm a social media uh uh some different a conservative website said\nHave picked it up and this is where National Review a wrote the article that said the pipe bomb or and powder delivered to CNN were harmless this was an article that came out a at nine nine PM from jak crow at National Review\nAnd the reference that he gives is the Associated Press story right into a link to that right they link is to write so we linked to the story\nAnd said okay because we didn't see that anywhere else and we said what does the Associated Press story says you know what what does it say and it's funny 'cause during our pre show meeting when I read it I said oh it's saying is that I read it a second time I said well no it's not saying it because what it says is a law enforcement official such tests of determine\nThat a holder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless\nRight route or out your harmless referring to the powder though that it that's the indication as the it refers to the powder not the pipe bomb now there is no indication as we've stayed to start to show off\nThe FBI has not we have not seen the words these raw active lied bombs that could have gone off ... we've seen what but the potentially quote potentially destructive devices and we've asked the question what is potentially destructive devices mean\nWe've seen suspicious packages I'm looking at the last time I checked Fox News about\nTwenty minutes ago they still have the headline suspicious packages uh we talked about the the Wall Street journal though actually are calling them mail bombs but not having a quote you know from the FBI stating that they were mail bombs these little things and and again we're just two idiots overnight\nBut these are the the little things that are picked up in different websites are not picking it up just quoting the national review story and not linked him to the Associated Press story\nThat you know that the that you know that the a package sent a to CNN was harmless we don't know whether it was or not\nWe don't know if the the uh the the suspicious package separate from the powder in the envelope was harmless there's like there's nothing in the a P story according to their source that says that\nRight and that's what National Review has referenced right and they're headline pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and other websites are picking that up we don't know outside that Associated Press story that doesn't say that right if you read the said yeah that's that's the\nPoint is that right the the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not eating those ... from the a P right\nYou know so it it's just because the problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction\nIf you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so you know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah there's been so they were just an oversight fear in my opinion\nBecause that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh that's not what the ...\nWashington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with the other was harmless you know a along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that that the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue\nUp until election day if not pass that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are

not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame that the ones who claim that they're against divisiveness are\nCommitting the the one of the biggest sends a device of this\nAnd that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind you right\nRight\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked the question that if it was it if they are like that if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off a then you have to look at that in a different way that if\nClearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare war and attempt a possibility of an attempt\nTo ah you know look at manger figures in the Democratic party that are not lie well by members\nOf the right in this country and you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them ... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb\nIt would be was it said by somebody on the left to try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether\nThe bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\n[noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who response\nRight and that could be never\nSo at the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of\nOf how males sorted or by the secret service or in ... in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation\nUm that I think you have to take into consideration what they already know about you know patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing and and their resources are there probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course\nCameras being everywhere so you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion\nBut we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral\nIt's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference and we may learn that uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off\nBut that is not what you're seeing here and the a P report that was the source of the national review article\nWhich again just looking at social media overnight is gone it has gone viral ... that she there was if we don't know that yet and I Associated Press story does not state that and it's important that\nYou know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the a reporter for CNN and that looked at Martha ... who was interviewing\nOne of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right and he said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state that is trying to destroy the you know this trying to disrupt the election or\nAs you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm so what the CNN reporter put out was only the response from this expert of that it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it can be somebody from the right\n... it could be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left\nBecause the election is just two weeks away where I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out and what did the CNN reporter to eat out just the port the report that apparently media matters poured out which is a left leaning\nA or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion you know on the left as if that's who he blamed\nAnd Martha mckell I'm like oh yeah Oh absolutely yeah are fasting and something like that and the citizenry spotted they all believe it's somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news you didn't include the entire statement right\n\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review\nAnd the difference between the story that they used as their stores it's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time but it's important that as you as you\nYou've got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it in social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNow you don't win anything by a you know media matters by putting out incomplete information which indeed is fault if you don't include the entire statement\n\nThat's what we deal with I mean that's the world really deal with you and I taught of talked about this many times that ... we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right\nAnd arguing the truth versus the conspiracy theories that have troops that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times now I Will admit that the story that you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press one I read it and say you\nWhen I read it the first I said wow Eric look they're saying that the bottom and I read the first sentence\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless\nThey didn't even mention about the suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way right on that one so\nUh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know\n\nThe possibility of lung cancer can be pretty scary especially for women in proximity eight million current and former smokers in high risk that's why I said by the skin down once

I honestly don't think at times and I get this by the way from not my opinion it actually was when I read Bernard Goldberg book by us\nAnd he said they were in the media they really don't know they really don't think that they're biased they really don't and and he was in the end he wouldn't go right he'd worked for Denver he just thinks that they're right on everything but they never even miss the obvious things\nLike the obvious irony that as they're calling for the end the divisiveness they are putting out the most divisive statement that they themselves are not conscious that they're doing it\nBut they don't even believe that they just think they're they are so just driven by tunnel vision that they don't even know that they're doing it and I so\nThat that that really didn't come from you that came from Bernard Goldberg who worked for Dan Rather and wrote the book biased and talked about the media at large and the mindset that they actually have they don't walk around thinking\nThat were Democrats and Republicans are thinking there's Democrats or Republicans and there's a way that we think and we're always right and they never questioned the way that they think they actually don't analyze what they're saying that the time that they're doing it\nAnd I just believe and again we don't know because you know ... whether it's soccer or whatever I Can't read his

several high profile Democrats and CNN yesterday as an act of domestic terrorism discounts the bomb reports from New York\nYesterday morning members of the joint terrorism task force we're going around to mail Rosen high profile buildings here in New York according to NYPD deputy commissioner John Miller\nConservative Web sites have picked it up and that is the a story by jak road that says pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless and the first sentence the pipe bomb and white powder that forcing evacuation at CNN headquarters in New York City more Wednesday morning we're harmless a law enforcement source told Associated Press\nWe saw this in our pre show meeting and went to the Associated Press article that National Review references and in that article they do not say that uh what the actual article says is that quote this is from the Associated Press from their seven fifty PM update last night a law enforcement official said tests determine\nThat a powder found inside an envelope\nDelivered to CNN along with the pipe bomb was harmless it does not say that the pipe bomb or the bomb was harmless it says that the envelope was harmless that has been going all throughout the ... through websites and social media\nThroughout the night and again we don't know what National Review was reference\n... besides the Associated Press reference we don't know whatever other reference they were using it but clearly the Associated Press a story does not say that I Will give them the benefit of the doubt because they are a very reputable in my opinion they they they want to make sure they get the facts right\nAnd I will tell you that the first time during our pre show meeting when I read that sentence that's how I took it until I rented a second time right that I said oh\nSo the bottom was harmless too and I have a wait a minute that's not what it says the quotas law enforcement officials said tests have determined that they powder found inside an envelope delivered the CNN along with the pipe bomb was harmless right not in the pipe bomb right and there's a there's a difference there so\nWe just wanted to make note of that now we don't know and but there is a question that this is a as three days is what the FBI said the FBI knows whether these were alive bonds or not\n\nThey know but they have not yet all we have gotten is potentially ... potential potentially explosive devices and and so you you ask yourself the question not in not in we're not in conspiracy theory mode where simply why in the investigation would they not want that released well it'd be\nYou know because there are a number of theories here are possibilities as to what this could be or the what the motive could be\nBehind the individuals but ah that were responsible but the the concern here is is that um or I guess the question here is whether or not they at at at any point ... whether these devices were meant to send just a message\nOr whether they were intended to kill or maim individuals\nThat's a very different\nMotives and and mission by the person responsible for ... response\nThose are the questions you to be asking as an investigator mhm and so you would want to know the answer to those questions\nMy point is if it's leaking out from law enforcement the ISIS parity flag and everything else and are these selective leaks why don't we have a leak yet if sources are telling\nThese news organizations\nDifferent things the powder isn't there why isn't anybody asking the question we're the bombs live would they have gone off with a on a timer\n\nIs there an investigative reason why they would not do that but they would be leaking out other information\nYeah right I don't know the answer and I I there's there's no sense of a suspicion there's no conspiracy theory here these are just questions\nThat I had because it ... it gets to the heart of wanting to you of a I think everybody wanting to know what the motivation of the person or persons who did this\nWhat the motivation is and you don't know until you know you you can't even start to to come to a a a path of possibly a path to go down to figure out why this happened unless you know whether the bombs were actually bombs or they were fake bombs ...\n\nBecause the motivation then they'd be completely different right\nWhile you're looking to send a message to the people uh the the the would be recipients you're also looking to send a message to the country and the world knowing full well that this would make the news\nOr the interesting thing is when you actually go through it and you look we were when you look at Fox News and others are and I did mention the wall Street Journal ... called the pipe bombs and I said no we're in there did I see a quote in the wall Street Journal\nThat said pipe bombs that were for her to the FBI or investigators talking about it so I've seen that in many different articles and human I've gone through a ton of different uh uh uh you know news reports overnight to try to find out\nYou know if anybody at you know throughout the night if anybody is leaking whether these were actually working live bombs that had explosive material and the detonator and the timer\nOr whatever you would use\nIn what they claim were crude devices right 'cause we were been told they were you know type type like bombs crude devices potentially explosive devices I don't know what potentially means\n[noise] well that's just my question if you use the word potentially does that mean it wasn't armed wasn't triggered wasn't ready to be triggered\nThat potentially had it been armed it would've been explosive\nI don't know\nBut the phrasing the phrasing is is is a is key by the media because we\nDon't we haven't heard this is why we're looking for quote from people actually doing the investigation well within fighting the FBI I I'm I may be taking the liberty here\nBut within\nThirty seconds mhm of looking at those bombs ... an FBI bomb expert would be able to tell you whether it was legitimately a bomb or not ...\n\nAnd whether it was a working or lied bar so if it's three days old why don't we know\nRight\nAnd I'm asking from an investigator point of view is a reason that they wouldn't tell you because it would tip off something\nTo the possible suspects I don't know I I but it's very strange for three days have gone by and other things have leaked like the the image of the the parity image of the ISIS flag\nThe other picture to get her done that stuff's leaking we still don't know whether it was a lie bummer lie bomb or not or lied bombs\nLied bomb in that case for CNN or whatever we don't know why don't we know\n\nSo because they know ... you know the FBI knows right yes\nAnd certainly the person responsible knows now that the FBI knows right\nIf you want to get in we do have a line open eight six six Ninety red eye\nThe following disclaimer about bad week is provided by Kim winter of the U.S

of the day this is a good one All right\nThis is one of US Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri Democrat incumbent one of her final ads for the twenty Eighteen campaign and what it is meant to do is just that the well known Democrat apart from\nThose crazy Democrats in her party quote crazy Democrats in her party or you should know that this is her ad yeah this is the ad of her campaign approved by her so even though it is to men\nTalking about Claire McCaskill is her message\nTo the people of Missouri that she is not one of those crazy Democrats I'm going to play the ad or from the the beginning because I Want you to hear that you know she says she approves\nOf this ... so you know it's a campaign ad an and not of a pack had a you know or just a a general ed from an outside group in Rio\nAnd then on Capitol candidate for Senate and I approve this nothing funny about this jobs highly ... well no holidays and yell lawyer who worked in any support those what does he do now\nWell I think we just elected him to attorney general our men and are prosecuting criminals and it never even tried to have in Hollywood crowd handling at the gym now buying and wind during work our [laughter]\nAll that is a team around the one thing how he did do is use our tax dollars are filed a lawsuit and protections for preexisting medical conditions yeah\nTotally health insurance company or not I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill but I don't know if you work hard fighting against those terrorists doing all those town hall record of how to stand up against her own party and Claire not one of those crazy Democrat and worst writing in the middle of the time [noise]\nYeah a whole\nWorks right in the middle and finds compromise did she do that on Kevin Oh now what what what's interesting is is the ... the fact that it goes if I'm a political consultant I'm looking at this and again I I could not if I'm a political consultant I might be able to tell you a nationally what to do I would still have problems\nFiguring out Missouri 'cause I don't know what Missouri's problems are when you're inside Missouri ... when you're inside of a time limit of town you know more of what their their er or state you know more of what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time\nBut it was interesting too so I understand uh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue it was mentioned twice was the terrorists\nNow I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat that the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you you mentioned it you know white okay because you believe it's important\nYou also know or you believe is we ... we inside this way back when in springtime\nOr we know we said this when when the weight before that we said this one the Republicans passed\nThe health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been so you've got bad and you've got
