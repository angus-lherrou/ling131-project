withdraw no you stand and fight that's what you teach your daughters and your son's you're going to stand and fight when you were wrongly accused but see this is what they want\nThese people are going apoplectic as a bunch of them got arrested yesterday in the heart Senate building because they're losing\nAnd and and they thought this was going to be they're winning issue and now this is blown up in their faces more from Susan Collins\nAllegation fail to me the more likely than not pander there for I Do not only that the charging ten their lead per than\nJudge Kavanaugh friend surfing on the court\nAnd you know I mean it's you know thought out and the rest of it and or any of the ... the that's a report from somebody I Believe it was meant that's correspondent coming to your ... or ... or whoever that is so they go Susan Collins ladies and gentlemen as a yes Murkowski\nAs far as we know is a no and Jeff Flake is yes\nSo if we have as I Believe it was going to happen\nJoe Manchin is that yes the ... on on the Democratic side there were basically at fifty one and you don't need you know only well you're gonna have to have my parents because you've got to do is go into the his daughter's wedding which is just got I mean I understand these things happen but [noise]\nUh this is a big vote you know of course they can hold the vote open and they will and now look ... mark my words uh\nWhere did I put that story I have a story and show prep yeah hold on a second 'cause this guy is going to his daughter's wedding he's walking down the aisle and all that kind of stuff I don't have it in front of it anyway he's got a\nColleague who is offered his private plane flying back to Washington watch the left go nuts on that old white privilege mail\nOn a plane of private jets so we can come back into women's rights\nOh that's just dandy I mean that's a bigger and they'll they'll talk about how that the legal and it's a campaign contribution and all the rest of it\nWhen the guys just trying to walk his daughter down the aisle when she gets married and then come back in votes but did you mark my words they're gonna they'll file a lawsuit you'll have George\nSoros the rest of these folks have their phone so this guy's going to go in and take care of business with the family wedding which you should do\nAnd then he's going to come back and vote but they may not named him or they could do this actually if it ends up being a ... I think we're going to get one or two more uh Democrats because there's some there's some close\nContest out there that can't afford that they just can't afford the margin I mean I'm looking at some of these folks are in close races up there\nAnd uh you got in Missouri Claire McCaskill she's probably going to vote and it may be the end of her and I hope it is she's probably going to vote against Kavanaugh which will be great we also have a dream and who have a beer Oh hi Hi can't we already know she's tourist\nI Would think she is I mean her opponent suffer like ten or twelve point so I don't know a way or the other one okay yeah now test there would be an interesting one in Montana or he's an incumbent Democrat\nOr last poll that I saw was a grab his poll and that was from a about a week ago that had test her up by four points that's close to margin of error stuff so his test are going to vote for or against capital Montana's a fairly conservative state\nSo you could see a couple of more Democrats\nAre end up voting for Kavanaugh but it'll be interesting to see now other things that are going on whether you are a lot of things going on with the surrounding this but there's some great news out their unemployment at the lowest level\nSince Nineteen sixty eight and here's an interesting side note to the Nineteen sixty nine this is an interesting side note\nBecause Charlie out there who sends me a lot of stories they sort of like the vast half\nWest on in the western part of the country he said he said thinking about this thing about what's going on in Nineteen sixty nine ... half million soldiers oversees this is in the throes of Vietnam and the unemployment rate was that low so\nI Would assume if you're if you're in the military and you're working you're considered employed right\nOne of the magic and ...\nNo I didn't say anything about you searing fuzzy theory to think about this when I was going to Nineteen sixty nine bread ham million soldiers overseas and frozen Vietnam or she just she came out here than she get wiped out cheese theory anyway\nFaring [laughter]\nBe will say that's that's women abuse yeah 'cause listen when he talks to you're probably talks his wife like that too\nUm where was it oh yeah with all these troops overseas think about that and we have that so we have\nWe have the lowest unemployment since then and we had all these folks overseas which is bound to keep the unemployment rate really low am I right\nThis is just phenomenal was what I'm trying to say now we're not even a war time we don't have a bunch of folks drafted and and and working in the military this is just in peace time I would love to see that how does this unemployment\nRelate to other peace time unemployment tech World War two out take Vietnam take Korea out\nPeace time unemployment this may be the lowest than a hundred years it may be I'm not saying that it definitely is but it may be\nSo my question is how on earth\nCan you be looking at this economy Hispanic unemployment hits a new record low Hispanic unemployment if you're Hispanic and you and you know people say well Hispanics are hardworking folks agree a lot more wind the world would you vote for Democrats if you've got\nJobs manufacturing confidence in an all time high all time high\nAnd Trump's approval rating now his fifty one percent so I Can't imagine for weeks from now

Murkowski\nReally I don't know but\nThat's the case I don't see how it is if we if you've lost Murkowski then you don't have fifty one Republicans all there is if you gain a Joe mansion you and that one back so it's it was so you've got but that's where the\nDanes there I mean Danes as a Republican is me okay well ... then then we'll we'll see what happens ah I I couldn't tell you I couldn't tell you what's going to happen all although well I could tell you what's going to happen\nAnd that is that you're not going to have a situation where\nI'm a writer Mitch McConnell are going to go vote and

I'm sure all these porn sites went away just in a lot\nOf poor guy [laughter] [laughter]\nOh okay well there you go\nSo I make Chester and Jeff may be related we've got to find that out because this is really bugging me well here's where we stand where you can call him I mean he is he in Florida is that where he went I think he'd yeah even in Sarasota and he believes in okay here's where we stand folks we got flake or yes\nAgain Murkowski is a no and then we've got Collins who was a yes and mentioned as a yes\nAnd so that puts this as far as my calculations summit correct me if I'm wrong on my math here but if Murkowski is a Republican and she's now and Manchin is a Democrat and he's yes we're back to where we were were fifty one\nBut here's the here's the wildcard there's a senator Danes and I'd never even heard of them before today I just have to say that well I think I have steam Danes but I don't know much about him anyway\nAjmi walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding and that'll be tomorrow\nBut he's going to be back sentence curly on track to take a procedural vote to advance the nomination and they did that already this morning and then with the final confirmation vote possibly at five pm on Saturday will Danes told CNN Today\nThat GOP leaders may be forced to hold open the confirmation vote for Kavanaugh overnight\nAs a senator returns to Washington from his home state where his daughter's getting married I'd come back after the wedding he says it'll probably be early morning\nAh we're we're taking it a day at a time to see what happens there the lay without another twist to what has been ... confirmation process for a widow so maybe they may hold it open till Sunday Morning\nBut they're going to have to have a weather technically have to have him\nBut the point is if they don't have him it's fifty fifty and Mike Pence makes a tie breaking vote\nAnd I'm telling you the Republicans don't want to do that because then that's all we'll hear from now until eternity is out Kavanaugh was never confirmed by a majority even though he would be the majorities Mike Pence Mike Pence's vice presidents serves as president of the Senate\nSo he's gotta votes so yeah hey just as an exercise a little less there's a tie but he is constitutionally an officer of the Senate and can votes\nBut that's not gonna be good for the Democrat so but I here's what I'm suggesting to you\nBiting Mitch McConnell's taking all this into into consideration and I think he has maybe one maybe two other Democrats aside from Maine and who are going to vote for this thing who are they going to be\nI couldn't tell you I Hope it's not Claire McCaskill you folks in Missouri she needs to go down and if she votes against Kevin all this change she ... she votes for him there's a change she survives in\nYou know she's just that much of a politician she may do this but then again she's also that much of a liberal but she doesn't want to hack offer base constituency so she sort of in a\nNo win situation when\nI got to tell you this I went to uh the guy and they'll move we hand\n[noise] we had a nix are seeing who's the or the right now you went and Nick on what few days ago talk about this thing we have back on on friday and I were talking about this afterwards Nick is very unassuming this guy's been in all sorts of stuff\nAnd this guy was in fried green tomatoes he was in the fugitive he was a sheriff and the fugitive he was in cast away with Tom Hanks there was a buddy at FedEx when they were before he went off on [noise]\nUm he's been in a bunch of stuff he's on a justified which I've not seen that show but he's a big star on that you've been watching that I mean you got to justify the name of it\nAnd I haven't seen that I actually saw him in a there's a TV adoption of lethal weapon well that's right that's what she has a fairly good and he was in it that you know that the fact of the day we had him off\nSo here he is you know he's telling us well I got a little partners so he's the director of the movie and I got a little part in the way he's got a little part he is\nHe is Kermit God's nails defense attorney and he's the one arguing the case and a lot of this is a courtroom drama\nAnd by the way it's not roses not gory but it is something that will make you think on so many levels\nI thought it was fantastic and yeah I went in there or not knowing what to expect for one thing but again when it's an independent film you're always worried you know what's the acting going to be like dean king was grade a delay the lady who uh escapes my\nMemory now is those ... who's the prosecutor she was fantastic I mean everybody in there and and Nick Searcy was fabulous so I mean everybody and they did a really good job but and there's no bus on that it's just\nIt's not an abortion moving and I think that's what people are you know if you're trying to get ... um it it it is a it's a murder\nInvestigation because what was happening was Kermit guys now this abortion is and and usually what I took away from it was this the political correctness\nThat we're experiencing in this country for one thing Tom Ridge was the governor of the time had explicit orders or at least somebody from his office not to inspect abortion clinics\nAnd you can say well okay you know their reasoning was we don't want to do anything he was a river or a Republican governor don't want to do anything that makes people think he's trying to stand in the way of a woman's right to choose\nYet they inspect nail salons and they have to be certified every year they hadn't inspected this place in Seventeen years\nWhile in Seventeen years\nWill you'll see I don't want to give out with this guy would if you've read the reports and all this is true story obviously\nThe guy killed a bunch of and we're not talking about abortion king you know 'cause you know people for their pro life say well the killing babies it was sort of abortion that someone would argue for another day these were full develop born babies that he was birth thing and then shipping the back of their necks and killing them\nCrying babies crying babies\nAnd this had been going on for Seventeen years\nWithout inspection because of the political correctness of the atmosphere of going we don't want to upset the body because you know the thing that we're trying to take away a woman's right to choose but once you see this is just unbelievable now I'm going to tell you a couple of things that he told us after the movie\nThat I don't think gives way too much I just want you to look for it when you see the movie of credit I thought you know they really got some really good actors of this thing there is a ... a there was a picture taken a while they refer to his baby a as one of the babies that was born alive\nAnd one of the um the nurses working there one of the ladies I'm losing she was actually a nurse she took a lot of pictures of a lot of different things she decided that she wanted to take a picture of this baby\nAnd this baby was born alive and and permit guys know killed the baby so she took a picture of this baby fully developed baby\nThat Kermit Godzilla killed a named up using as evidence was one of the things that convicted on one of the council murder so I'm not telling you too much about it but obviously you know the guys in jail for the rest of his life because he committed murder this is just the way they got it and\nWhat I'm Nick Searcy told me the director there's a scene in the air where they're showing the picture of baby a to the jury right and this is in the movie and\nSaid those folks are very good actors I mean they you know you you really did a good job good news so she said let me tell you some of them we showed them the actual pictures that was the first time they've ever seen it so\nWas not like you I mean yeah it was good acting but what we did was we said look we're going to show you the picture of this baby and you just react naturally as you would I mean there were people crying people you know disgusted or whatever it was just amazing and they pan across the jury\nLead author of this new study out of the University of Colorado Denver said this is a really important time period and children's lives to experience fruits and vegetables she found

that would have been up doubts but it was the outer ranges miss of the allegations as the war on\nThey convince or does this guy was being railroaded that she thought it was unseemly that we have this type of activity this type of conduct entering the confirmation process so she couldn't just votes for Kavanaugh let it be done with that\nShe asked to make a floor speech on the Senate so she could

the doesn't even doesn't even make a comment and then we had her say this\nI was very disappointed because I Know that had a comment very much cares about let's see if I got ... and ... and Harry ... to a case that's happening in that case but the bottom line that case I\nHaven't I positioned why is that the Catholic Church shed and not have to file even a two page farm here not provide coverage for insurance for their employees\nRight skip down there loop through to the big turban comment the first one that you come to because you know people are screaming depressed grew how'd you this happened you're you're you're the minority whip and how did you live this happened\nWas an awful lot of people think that we are whip here since I guess that's my title and we have always ways to push storms of discipline are members [noise] it just doesn't work the\nIndividual members have to reach their own conclusions particularly on historic decisions\nAnd you know historic decisions so there you go a [laughter] he's seeing I can't tell people how to vote\nImagine that\nAs it looks like now it's going to be a cabin or confirmation come tomorrow they may even wait until the great Danes gets back then that will be Sunday Morning and they have the vote then who knows and that'll give him fifty one\nBut as it looks like I I I don't want to go to a limb I'm just going to say it's gonna he's gonna he's going to get confirmed but my suspicion is there maybe a couple of Democrats especially now that they know this thing is going to pass there may be several Democrats who jump on and say OK screw it [noise] I mean I\nYou know it'd be one thing if I could have prevented this from happening or I certainly didn't want to be the lynchpin vote that made this confirmation happened but uh I'm In I'm In a tough race so if this is going to happen without me\nThen I'm going to be on the side of my constituents on this thing and that may you know even you know Heidi Heitkamp is already says she's voting against it but she may change your mind I mean if\nI'm here I'm going what the heck Hail Mary time isn't it hail Heidi\nJust throw one to the end zone Heidi I mean you're down by twelve boys ten points whichever the fall is\nYou may be able to salvage that I think she's thinking if I Do that I get maybe five points back and then and then I screw\nUp my chances to go to work with the pink hat lady so\n[noise] you know I don't know I Want to do that but then you could justify it by saying look here here we are\nHere we are at this late begs they've counted the votes obviously they've got the vote so they wouldn't golfer vote my constituents overwhelmingly want this guy confirmed\nSo who am I to say no I'm not going to do this yeah I'm a Democrat\nBut I got a state that overwhelmingly once this guy on the Supreme Court and we'll give them what they want I'm willing to vote with Kavanaugh secretly thinking maybe I can pull the Senate thing [laughter] but whatever but then if we get that one of Claire McCaskill\nBeside she's going to vote for cabin offer the same reason\nI mean all I got to do is explain I don't want to explain everything to the\nTo the conservatives are the Republicans in Missouri all I got to do is explain to the hysterical crazy screaming folks out there why did it it is because my state wants me to do this and he was going to pass anyway so I'm getting my state what I Want\nI can see that happening in Flint and that's a flash in an instant together case you know [noise]\nSo we've got we've got other news too but really not worth mentioning\nNo we got we got a Dr\nFord friend she guilty of witness tampering this is a piece from the national review folks who wrote this was this Andrew ... knows Charles Cooke\nAnd um\nThe wall Street Journal reported that a friend of Christine Blasey Ford told FBI investigated this she felt pressured by Dr forward allies to revisit her initial statement that she knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by teenage Brett Kavanaugh\nWhich she later updated it said that she believed but couldn't corroborate Dr Ford's account according to people familiar with the matter legal in Kaiser's who we're talking about she that this is Dr Ford has said was present at the gathering where she was allegedly assaulted in the Nineteen eighties\nLeland Kaiser told investigators that Monica McLean\nNow this is interesting Monica McLean who's a retired FBI agent and she was in the court I mean in the Senate Judiciary committee with\nDr Ford it's interesting isn't it and then we get an FBI investigation so I don't Neal\nHad urged Leland this this uh McLean woman had urged Leland Kaiser to clarify her statement now Charles Cooke is explaining why it would be hard to make this into a witness tampering case\nAnd I think the ... the thing is the the optimal word is clarify\nNot ... not necessarily\nChange your statement but clarified in other words\nShe joined you're saying that you believe Dr Ford but that you don't remember the Julian ... and that you've never met Brett Kavanaugh what can you clarify that that's what it could be I think what it meant was\nCan you clarify this or that we get our when we got to have somebody over here because this woman's out she's sucking ban there I mean she looks like she's a nut case over you know by me she's all these people including you and nobody remembers it\nAnd that's what I think they meant by clarify but I'm for the life of me\nWho has been telling you since day one since a ton of testimony why they didn't call Dr Ford on texting back and forth with this legal and Kaiser woman\nIn that witness tampering I think that's far worse than anything that Mr McLean woman could have done McLean woman contacts ring says well maybe can you clarify this you've got the actual woman in question who was texting back and forth where they're constantly she says this is that our testimony\nWhy is that not witness tampering as I told you before and I told you the bay of Thursday a week ago it Brett Kavanaugh headset in his testimony while\nYou know mark forward in a in the ... I mean mark judge mark judging I never got anything heart judge and I've been a you know texting back and forth he was telling me you know he was really supportive of\nThem at all oh well did you saying judge that you were texting with one of the witnesses and the doctor for to solve thing well we're going to demand to see those text messages can you imagine they wouldn't say that I Can't imagine they wouldn't 'cause I Would want to see him to\nWhat did you say them are judging the text message well the same thing should have been asking Dr Ford what did you say the ... to a legal in ... but you just sit you text messaging back and forth what were you saying there oh nobody knows 'cause nobody subpoenaed to text messages\nWe don't need to rehash this forever because it's now a moot point or at least it will be tomorrow it looks like\nBut going forward we need\nAnd this is basically what it boils down to folks and I hate to say a ... and again I Would caution Trump from saying something like this and I would caution and me the the um Republicans out there on the trail they don't need to anger the other side but I don't give a crap so [laughter] I'll just tell
