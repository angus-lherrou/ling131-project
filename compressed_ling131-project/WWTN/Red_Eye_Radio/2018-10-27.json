us short all of this out Steven how are you\nA great thanks for having me\nThe guy apparently was a Tarheel fan too 'cause I think it was a Tarheel cap on his a dashboard so I guess all tar heels are

thieves beliefs but the guy I work for the Bernie campaign so I mean what gives\nPurple that comparison it's been coming up a lot today a but in this case it seems pretty clear that that the suspect was a supporter of President Trump\nUm apparently I is a political I'm leading the seat he didn't necessarily Scott's a whole lot in the past eight I spoke to a former attorney who represented him in that case and a a former employer who I\nHired him see it male stripper in the past um who said that they they don't recall them ever talking about politics or so you know it it it it's clear I he\nHe

going to be learning a lot more about his political leanings 'em and his parents ah ah parents' support for President Trump going forward\nAnd the question is does it matter because it didn't matter when we had a a guy actually worked on Bernie campaign shootings the belief that didn't matter at all I didn't make a big deal about that either I said this isn't some crazy guy they're crazy people in the right and left\nAnd I was in the hash tag and Bernie shooter\nA but they're you know this is a magnet bomber and all this stuff has been going on for the last few days and these people are having a field day can't wait while I was gonna say can't wait to see a Rachel mad cow but I never watch or don't watch the network but it seems to me a little bit unseemly denounce tried to link this

aggressive leak announcing people he you know\nYou don't really feel that I guess in motion and um he doesn't do it quite as um for ... President Trump\nI'm the president ... of course the mailing bombs to people is it different than making light of a congressman body flipping a report they're very different things of course but um at the people of course they're going to die so she is the President Trump's rhetoric\nAll comes down to one thing that's turned out and if you folks ain't turning out you have nobody to blame oh I Wish

that band just look to perfect almost like a Bible rap job\nAs a bet that outlet southern Florida which I spent a lot of time down there\nYou are the some fading you'd see some things that basically indicate that ban has not looking like it just got that job put on it I'm thinking this whole thing is a scam they've found a guy that had a medical problem with that probably caught before doing this kind of stuff and they're trying to figure out a way to well just distracted everybody with another problem\nTo divert attention from what's going on which is what's coming up on the border\nYeah I I it does seem rather I mean it's like over the top this guy's or Trump guys not like oh you may have voted for Trump or we may have gone to a Trump rally it's like this guy is just one thousand percent Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump it does seem a little odd doesn't\nIt seem unbelievable almost laughable but at the same time I don't want anybody to get hurt but there's enough information out there to say that this is all just a big ploy to divert somebody's attention to you know make us look bad I'm a Republican or more specifically take the eyes off the prize which has those\nUpwards of twenty thousand people coming toward the border as we speak\nSo you're in Missouri is that right I Am\nHow's the McCaskill race looking out there\nWell up it would only put a ... a picture of her she's a little behind right now ... looking good but\nThere were trained her as a young ...\nA lady whereas she you know if you look at the local media of crafts that I comment on a regular basis I think I'm about to get banned from the local uh television affiliates but\nThey're putting a picture of her from Thirty years ago ... tried to make her look like she is a young vibrant woman whereas in fact she's been in that way too long\nAnd everything they have to say about it is\nJust completely wise than I Am totally for Holly I think it's time for a change and I think he's the right guy\nWhen will it remains to be seen or any word on how the voter turnout as you get really voting out there\nYeah but you know it hasn't been really I I think\nA chapter yet in the media but I Do know that there have been some early voting I'm certainly ready to go my wife my family everybody that eligible to vote where we got our everything wind up and and I think we all know how we're voting\nI'm not normally a straight ticket guy but I think this year I'm gonna have to including on proposition ... which is another gas back trying to you know just take more money out of our wallets\nTo improperly distributed to people here in Missouri that doesn't actually go to our roads and highways\nReally they would do that they really do you mean they're going to try to divert money but it should be going somewhere to somewhere I Can't believe that\n[laughter] it unbelievable number what happened when the men are happening All right well preachy chicken in their things from phone call that get you to it's a [noise] I don't know I'm not seeing them nervous because none of this makes me nervous because I got plenty to talk about it\nAway from a from a job if you're ... oh I bet you wish this or I bet you wish that I mean I've gone through how many ministry said oh I bet it is good for rabbit I Will tell you this Trump it's been radio gold I Will not deny that Trump has been an absolute radio gold\nA mutt having said that\nI'm worried about the country I'm not worried about my gig I'm not worried about stuff to talk about our find stuff to talk about no matter what happens and you can imagine\nIf we've got a Democratic Congress and a Republican president is going to be plenty to talk about so from a selfish standpoint and don't misunderstand me no van Gogh listening out there\nIf I were to say for ratings what would be best for me it'd be best for me the Democrats won and took over at least a house or the Senate and then we'd have fireworks all the time people all worked up getting all upset about what the Democrats ...\nBut I'm worried about the country so I Want to move the country forward you know probably the worst thing for me can be absolute smooth sailing in Congress where we where we get um the legislation that makes sense in Donald Trump's signs it and then we move on them and the thing that could you know that that's got to be the most boring thing\nFor me but I don't care I Love boring I Want to get the job done and I think that um that's what needs to happen to see what I had been predicting year if the Republicans hang on and that's it is\nI think Nate Silver and you know he was wrong on Hillary so I don't know how much credence you put a Nate Silver Nate Silver I Believe is giving the Democrats in eighty five percent chance of winning the house and like a Nineteen percent chance of winning the Senate\nSo he thinks that the Republicans are going to retain control of the Senate and the Democrats will take over the house I Would love to see the Republicans take over everything\nBecause what's gonna happen is it the Republicans they're replacing our rhinos Jeff Flake Bob Corker you know a ... some of these others out there\nYou're going to get true Republicans in some of these open seats if the Republicans win and that means that Trump's agenda is going to go forward and here's something else too I don't want somebody in these rubber stamping everything Trump does I Want conservatives if Trump's going to go off on something that's not conservative\nLike I've scolded him on this whole infrastructure thing we've got to rebuild the infrastructure there's nothing wrong with the infrastructure for one thing but the infrastructure doesn't need to be rebuilt from Washington each state has their own gas tax they can do it and just like Doug was talking about Missouri\nYou know they want to raise taxes and they're not spending the money on what they're supposed to be spending among now this is in every state\nYou can look at your gas tax in your state\nAnd if the elected officials are honest they'll tell you that it's going to things other than roads and bridges and that's the only thing your gas tax will be going to go into the light rail it's going to bite pans is going to green ways is going to all museums is going to all sorts of happy horse dung\nThat has no business going to if they were to spend the gas tax on what they're supposed to be spending the gas tax on then there would be no problem\nIt's every state is in charge of their own infrastructure there's a federal gas tax and there's a state gas tax\nAnd uh the the federal gas tax us in the Washington and then it split up and then it set back to the states and that's kind of a dumb thing to and I understand that you know some of these states wouldn't get what they think they need and\nI don't know I I'm a big believer that you do a gas tax in on the state level of the state keep their own gas tax and then they can do whatever you know they can build the roads and bridges\nBut as I as I ride rent anything I see crumbling around here has has user error all over it and I'm not going to go into the details about four forty but they're fine they fixing that but that was just a boondoggle of stupidity\nAnd trying to put ridges and the thing and toward the thing all the pieces by the way I was in North Carolina last week it and\nAnd they've got the concrete with some of the original thing at a hole in it so apparently who was doing it over here has no idea what they're doing so we have to spend millions upon millions to re surface that now and I'm sure you see all that and your state\nTo a lot of its waste a lot of misuse of the money there ain't no infrastructure problems of stupidity [noise] [noise]\nI

social media dating back years not just in the last few months and I don't know that we can see that I Would assume Twitter\nFacebook wherever he's been they've they've deleted or frozen they account so you can't see me my I don't know I haven't gone looking for him today or will it matter of fact bell\nI got a couple of stories on that that are both share with you about what he was saying and the and the social media but apparently the guy is a first class nut case looks to be I mean anybody who's sending these\nDevices by the FBI says these were not hoax devices\nAnd I'm ... and they didn't go off so if he's a bomb makers that'd be a good one\nSo we'll be exploring all of that still don't have the you know listening to him again okay well as soon as we get this I'll explain what it is when we know\nA much you can do a search for this guy now my understanding is that the the social media that they're pointing to is not from saves are say ...\nIt's from the ... or somebody else and I looked at the pictures that I'm going well the mug shot picture makes them look like a woman to me a woman with very short have you seen the monk shot you think it was like a woman yeah\n'cause I

is Trump said that would that would lead somebody descend bombs everybody well he's he's always talking about the fake news and yeah well it is fake news but that doesn't mean that you send a bomb to

is to stop whatever it is they're talking about\nThis is a matter of free speech trumps just got some nut case comes forward with some up with some mail bombs are against some of the folks that Trump

one eighty on that oh my gosh we we could have kept on Trump's guy promoting that's an interesting observation I'm Glad you made that brand because if he is a convicted felon he's not supposed to be able to register to vote\nThat correct I mean they you know obviously he can a petition that Governor to to get that voting right back but uh\nOn her the that habit\nYeah there's a new thing that

bit but other than that I everything's great\nOkay um so\nI just had a simple question okay\nSo what are all of a warming aside or climate change inside let's talk about the G. G. I. bill wouldn't you like the the cleaner air for our country I mean that has nothing to do with climate change that's it you know the less fossil fuels workout cleaner air for our kids cleaner for\nFor hunting or will it be great but that the market should decide this I mean we've cleaned the Arab dramatically in the last few years and by the way the the main source of ah\nOf ah of this I'm a\nPollution real pollution I don't think is the automobiles its factories and things like this and I think we ought to be cleaning that up too so I'm a big clean air fan but the reality of factor that Britain is cars will write ... where do you think you're going to get the electricity\n\nThat my second point here over the let's go into the first one where are you going to get the electricity from coal fired plants I what I refer to these electric cars is coal fired cars so until we come up with a replacement for coal you're still going to have the same problem probably even worse\nWe owe more on a horse I think it's a good thing\nOh it would be a great thing to change but we don't have enough solar to replace coal that's why we moved from it\nLet me let me a second point right so obviously the second thing is so much economic uh\nBunch of waiting for people to take it people make money off the street you take a businessman like Trump about about the economy would want to take this opportunity with it if the horse\nBut it's not that's the whole problem with the money to be made there is not there yet if it were people would be doing it\nI think that's a real American way to go go or they want to like industry we want to take advantage of\nWell yeah but that comes from the private sector not the government that's my whole point lived the private sector moved towards solar if there's going to be money in it but right now there's not\nSo long ago\nOh yeah absolutely it it's going to change on his own eventually anyway I mean the more the technology comes down the pike that make solar more viable we're going to move towards solar but the problem is solar doesn't work at the ...\nI mean I I'd rather do it I feel like I Would not\nFor a one on\nThe phone bill if their electric cars that they are now and you're driving a V. eight Silverado what's wrong with you\n\nKnow it's not about liberal you're big on this and I don't blame you you're big on cleaning the air and everything Wyoming you've gotten electric vehicle they're all over the place\nThat we need that push for all of us\nSo in other words so I don't force you to do it before you're going to do it that doesn't make any sense\nWell I think that I don't I don't know\nAnd I'd been briefed appreciate the phone call with this new exactly what I'm Talking about I'm I'm doing is like Al Gore we need\nTo do something about global warming but I got five houses and\nCars all over the place and I fly all over the world I mean you folks who are out there wanting to save the environment and it's a worthy cause I'm just telling global warming is not a problem real pollution is but if you believe that your internal combustion engine is making the ear dirty then stop driving one\nBut Beth wants it mandated to him before he does it that makes no sense whatsoever if there are people out there who truly believe he sounds passionate about it\nIf they're truly believing that if he would stop driving

political correctness has gone crazy over there I I Would have a guarantee you this if you want to offend the Christians with something bad about Jesus you've probably seen it all day long\nFor sure

what was the only problem with them when when you're talking about somebody Diana Ross are you talking about I'm Sammy Davis junior or whatever\nBut the deal is it doesn't matter what they think we're talking about free speech here if the founding fathers\nYou're just like it wouldn't matter what I think the founding fathers\nProtected free speech they didn't think it was going to be free speech that everybody agreed with the reason they put that in there because they knew the people would have a problem with what somebody else said\nAnd so you have the right to free speech regardless of whether somebody is offended by it now in the case of Megan Kelly and as I've said about anything you know it it it\nBoils down to you know if the NBC's gig there you know their network they can pretty much do what they want to but I think that a chilling\nWho are supposed to be engaging in a talk show bits about free speech that when you exercise of free speech and you don't see exactly what they want you to do the fire you\nSo either you're gonna have a a show on the air this about free speech or you're not but you need the ... you need to put that in the ground rules\nYou can say whatever we want you to say is what big [laughter] it should be in the contract you need to run everything by as you can you can see what you want you can say what you what we want you to say and then\nYou don't have a talk show anymore you don't have a TV talk show you're on a radio talk show you don't have free speech anymore that point when you got some gatekeepers sitting in wherever New York and they're looking at ... my did my it's like the old sensors\nExcept at least the censors were trying to keep the F. word all theater but I mean back then you couldn't have Ricky Lucy and the same bed and times have changed and the left of course there's been so\nAdamant about well you know we we don't mean to be censoring then you know you need to be able to say whatever you want to and they don't have any problem with\nThe in the ass word or anything else on network television but by gosh you voice an opinion they don't like and then you're gone\nCan you imagine I guarantee you that would have no problem with with Megan Kelly saying the F. word but when you say the blackface word which by the way she wasn't defending blackface well what do you call what\nI call it somebody dress ... black faces ... an entire year all black you know [laughter]\nI mean it's not like somebody putting on black based in big wide around the lifting the when Mamet among folks\nBut again when you ask me to ask people if they're offended by it and why should I care good grief you want me run everything by everybody out there might offend good I'm sure we're going to hear from the Muslims on the pedophile thing\nBut that doesn't change the fact that it's true and it doesn't change the notion that I have of free speech\nSo if I think that Mohammed was a pedophile I can say Mohammed was a pedophile and I should not have to worry about it especially when there's documented evidence in the ... about it he married they want a girl when she was six and they confiscated the marriage when she was nine what do you call that\nSo I'm I'm not doing this to poke at the mayor or anything I'm just telling you this woman got fined in Austria\nFor having a class at a University in Vienna where they talked about Islam and talked about some of the the not so nice things about Islam and then she gets fined for it I'm sure she lost her ... to like Megan Kelly Dana you're up next the film at one time show how\nAre you know doing great\nSo I just wanted to call I uh I Know you've talked about mark I or are you to her\nAnd he did a video yesterday about the like Kelly Ayotte ahead folks like

really it would have watched video [laughter] I'm sure who's going to have to lose his gig on Syria sex him pig that they received the tip of my regular look for then what did they ask you this what I mean what if this comes up Howard Stern dressed\nAs as Clarence Thomas it it's a character you know what I mean it's it's a it's a real person like Diane Ross is there any difference\nOr what if they fire him now from series like them he is the thing that's making them the most money over there and one of them were they fire Howard Stern because they're going to go back twenty some years and find out that he dressed up like Clarence Thomas\nSee what I'm getting that where we get a photograph of me and Miami oh my gosh\nI'm just telling you folks political correctness is ruining this country

the bombs were no hoax\nHassle than unraveling sentence of rats\nRevealing a dark history of at least nine of rats including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh say I could also be making threats against high profile people in the media on his Twitter account mainly directed at CNN journalists\nEven with falcon custody investigators are stressing it does not mean to stretch over\nCan he well this I can tell you can\nAnd I don't think he's sealing the border what he's doing these major the illegals don't come across legal immigration will continue is not going to just say okay this is all over\nIt's unclear whether Trump is seriously considering it complete closure of the two thousand mile border with Mexico\nOr if he's using the threat simply the get America's southern neighbors to cooperate he vowed to use the U.S military to close the southern border he's talking about do we legal is not the legal folks there's all sorts of commerce coming back and forth across\nThe so many you think he's going to use the troops and go closed down every port of entry\nI don't think that's going to happen I don't think that's going to happen and here's what he tweeted and this was on the Eighteenth of October\nIn addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over their population I must and the strongest terms asked Mexico to stop this onslaught and as unable to do so I Will call upon a call up the U.S military to close our southern border\nWhat it means is to the to the illegals we're not going to them just run across the\nDesert you William yet given the job\nNot going to happen\nSo that's what that's all about but you don't hear much about the caravan because I'm hearing is starting all fall apart and of course we got the bomber today and they may have this crazy guy and now\nThere's a question as to who this guy actually is it's and again I don't want to feed into what you say you don't feed into but you do I'm just saying this guy is like ... ... it's like somebody out of central casting\nI mean he's got a band it's plastered with pro Trump stuff in CNN sucks and all this other stuff all over it and then there's pictures of him at a at you know with his ... hat and he's going to a rally in it you know it's everything from the boss Trump wine you know I mean it's just getting got everything\nState of Trump resource he played golf at ah at mar a Lago I mean it's you know it's it's really over the top and what we're hearing\nIs this guy may not be all that we're hearing he is and I warn you about that yesterday if this ends up being some Trump supporter\nWe need to be able to get his social media from several years back not just from the last couple of months and everything I've seen today is taking screen shots because they've cut they've closes accounts down on Twitter and Facebook show it from just October\nHow convenient what was he tweeting a year ago what was your twenty two years ago\nWhat was he saying to folks we don't have a clear picture of who this guy is and again if it turns out this is a nut case\nFanatic of Trump it doesn't mean that Trump's done anything wrong\nNo more than it meant that the Bernie Sanders' campaign worker was representing Bernie Sanders when he shot Steve ... and nobody in the mainstream media ever tried to make that connection but every time you turn around that's all they're doing is making the connection with Trump in this guy and a piece earlier today saying\nA Trump admits this guy was a Trump supporter but won't take responsibility of course he's not going to take responsibility he had nothing to do with it\n[noise] anyway\nSo the magnet bomber hash tag is now the top trend again today as you might imagine and here's what some of these folks are saying\nMrs a dentist can Grimes my favorite part of this story is knowing that the
