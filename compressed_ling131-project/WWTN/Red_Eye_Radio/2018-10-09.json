don't you buy a copy of stop mass hysteria and give it to someone who's not knowledgeable about the age that we're living in and where it fits and I want to go back to the killings at Kent State for a moment I made reference to it earlier on passing\nWhen students were killed and\nAnd he wanted by the national guard when they got out of control this was an interesting fact that you may not know Gallup poll taken immediately after the killings at Kent State showed that fifty eight percent of respondents blamed the students\nEleven percent blamed the national guard at thirty one percent expressing our opinion\nI don't think you understand what's lab will happen if George Soros says armies of left us continue to provoke a massacre a massacre there will be you could only push and push and push and push until there was push push push back\nAnd God Forbid that happens if a poll was taken most Americans will blame those who get hurt because there's only so much disorder a society can tolerate\nAnd we've I think we've past the point of tolerance of the radical left\nListen to what I'm saying to you for students killed nine ... nine year old ...\nAnd two of the force students to kill the Kent State\nAllison crops and Geoffrey Miller work in the protest for sure\nBut to others who were killed at Kent State Sandra Scheuer and William Schroeder or only walking from one class to the next time of the shootings and ironically Mr Schroeder was also a member of the campus ROTC battalion\nSo innocent people get killed when violence breaks out which is exactly what the legions of left this want\nThey want collateral damage in order to try and turn the populace against this administration and against the laws of the land don't let them have this victory\nThe power ultimately is in the hands of the people yes Donald Trump as a normal ... power yes he should pull the IRS that is the nonprofit status of the ACLU and all of the front groups of Soros who are disrupting our

is it barrels towards the Gulf Coast forecasters warn it is expected to hit later this week is a life threatening category three storm\nAnd they were all just marching aren't as strong as expected to dump four to eight inches of rain on parts of Florida Alabama and Georgia actually\nHurricane warning vote for portions of I'm far southern Alabama across the Florida Panhandle and then there was a surrounded by some tropical storm warnings and watches and it was pretty much will cover near the landfall so what the impacts expected to begin early Wednesday and then continuing through today Wednesday\nThere will be people that disagree with us it'll say your guys you're just you're you're just biased everything is seen through your bias dies and so we understand that yeah everybody has a a bias and we still believe that\nIt is the substance of where we stand on the issues and us explaining the substance\nThat really really counts but one of the things that we have done is we try to find those on the left that aren't trying to be political hacks which means those on the left agree with us ah and we\nAnd we try to bring we we tried to bring the intellectually honest a left in and we've done that in the analysis for example of President Trump and many of the different controversies that ah the media believes that uh he has created into those people are Jonathan Turley\nA the a well known constitutional lawyer and also Alan Dershowitz both did not vote for Trump ... or ... especially you know more I Know more about his political past\nThat even Turley but he is an absolute a dyed in the wool a liberal but he believes in the constitution and he believes in the bill of rights he is an old school left is sort of like\nA communal Kelly that we've uh playing on the air many many Times She's old school too when they don't know they look at today's Democratic Party and they say\n... like we do it they're they're becoming the mindset of a fascist that the authoritarian street is not in Trump it's in the Democrats ... well on Fox yesterday they brought in Bryan dean right\nWho is a Democrat strategist who said Democrats will suffer the rightful consequences of using the victims\nOf sexual assault to advance a political agenda he was on a Fox and friends and he explain what he met\nBrian van right and joins us now to explain what do you mean by that time\nWell I think what we saw in the beginning of August we had an opportunity to do the right thing which is work with Republicans quietly privately and investigate those allegations not in the public domain not new or a fact finding mission in front of cameras what to do this correctly\nAnd instead we use those allegations of the last possible minute and we rally that power base and we frankly traumatize a whole bunch of people are not just miss for him but also a lot of folks in America who has a suffer from sexual assault\nSo that is the strategy that I found appalling are watching these past couple of months so of the two parties who's more energized Brian going into the midterms [noise]\nI think we have a horse race I think it's neck and neck I I think that's a real question uh for November is going to be where do these independents fall so what's really interesting is that the polling shows the independents are leaning ever ... ever so slightly rather to uh to Trump and to the Republicans\nAnd this is especially true of man a white man Hispanic man and those folks who do not have a college education\nIn other words that as the Trump coalition and so it's the fact that continues to happen that's that's really the phone\nCoalition coming home for November So really benzene the strategy that that they are Democrats employed or has backfired\nYou know the ... and here's another thing that the women and and I've talked about there's five or six women that I Know that I've been close to for a long long time ... all of them at least over a decade all professional women\nWhen I first met them ... you know and and um as ten to Fifteen Years ago\nNot that political the majority I think one\nIn their mid to late thirties the other in their forties and fifties early fifties and\nAll professionals okay all executives and professionals\nAnd when I first met them none of them really political and they knew that when I first met them that I was a talk show host and it was\nWhole home now when I talk to them total interest in what's going on in politics all of them over the course of ten to Fifteen Years not because of my influence ... want to make that clear\nA are extremely conservative they are a whole but not if the Republicans there appalled at the Democrats\nAnd so there is this the mainstream media narrative that women naturally uh are attracted to the side of Dr Ford\nAnd feel sympathy and hate the Republicans for what has happened well the woman that I've talked to and again uh you know I've ... I've explain you know what what their background is\nEvery one of them know the fact that Dianne Feinstein could have kept a secret they look at it and they said the Democrats lose across the board here the Democrats lose because they could've kept quiet they could've kept that she was she claimed she wanted now they're suspicious as to who's telling the truth here but they said even if you believe\nDr Ford is that she really truly wish to keep it quiet then the Democrats completely betrayed her Dianne Feinstein completely portrayed her because as he just said and he's a democratic strategist\nBut Democrats had the chance to keep it all quiet to fulfill her wishes and still do an investigation and they said no we don't care about the woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted\nAnd wishes to have her anonymity we are going to use her as a political football we say to that earlier and I'm sure there were Democrats dating down on a there's a democratic strategist saying the exact same thing that's what will hurt the Democrats\nIs because that's what he as a Democrat believes that they have done\nWell and that's the damage that's his job is to assess essentially damage what works for them what doesn't work for them and it is not it did not work for them on any level\nBut not only did you have that situation where they clearly leaked it to the media then beyond that you had the overreach with the two additional accusers coming forward and ultimately the nail on the proverbial coffin in that\nThe sweating the allegation that came across from her by their hands through her lawyer\n... that was not only overreach but it was clearly a tactic by Abernathy who clearly has it out for this current president\nSo I have to ask this question because you know after on on Saturday on on on Saturday when I heard it okay\nWe're going to you know where you're Jerrold Nadler okay if we take Congress we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to impeach we're going to a beach\nAnd I thought that would die out because I thought to myself but that's a pretty bread a bad strategy you have lost in a variety of ways here I don't think this is a win for you\nSo why would you go out and attempt to motivate the right unless you believe you would motivate the left but still if you could impeach them you're not going to he's not going to leave\nYou know it'd be his Supreme Court seat you would need to go to\nThe Senate now a ... and this is the question I was asking does the house or the Democrats\nWho believe that they will be part of the house leadership and ... would be the head of the house Judiciary Committee a you know under under you know uh what would go on it if if the Democrats won a the the\nThe house um are they saying that because they believe that the people the both of them are idiots and they believe that they believe that impeachment means we can take 'em off the seat\nOr do they believe that this will just motivate their base and then they'll completely drop it if they win that they have no intention of of going after impeachment\nAnd hold him they'll scream obstruction by the the Republicans that that we wanted to get it done but the Republicans wouldn't let us get it done 'em and that we still want to get it done a it is one of those campaign promises that is definitely going to fall short over to obligations if they had the if they had the\nThe the majority of Republicans couldn't stop an investigation of and\nPeople will not an investigation the investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing is it's the promise\nUltimately what that you will remove him from the bench and that and not only that but that that's not going to have and what are you gonna do Dr Ford said she she's done or he doesn't want to be part of it are you going to subpoena all these women and bring them back again\nRight so that would be my question if democratic strategist are out there stating you've done damage to your own party drop this well\nAnd then because here's a question when you start moving in that direction how did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning who leaked to the media is not going to tell you because they don't have to reveal their source\nBut the investigation if you look at an investigation where would go and it will be public I mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material\nThat is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation how do you do that without revealing who leaked it\nAnd we know who leaked it so the problem is\nAs well and we know the human brain isn't than developing until someone in their mid twenties and teens shouldn't be using marijuana either with the exception of medical marijuana in only under a doctor's care\nI'm Dr Sanjay Gupta helping you a better life\nMessaging ... guys\nThis

today Tuesday\nAnd then oh he'll go to Iowa after he announced this um and he'll talk about it or you know no doubt while he's in our eye or the you know that it is the corn state\nWhat he's proposing is raising a not a mandate on the blend but raising ... on the blend a Fifteen Percent and then allowing wanting to change the credit for\nUh those blanche so uh this is the central it would be kind of a cap and trade means ... approach well there are credits though that they that the\nOil companies can buy okay oh they don't want to put like right now they don't want to uh Bob ... blend\nAt ten percent they can buy credits from other companies and then get the exemption so if they have those credit they're still compliant even if they're not lending up to ten percent he wants to allow them to blend it Fifteen Percent\nAnd to sell it year round the pushback on selling it year round has been for a Fifteen\nHas been that or eat ten even is that especially with the Fifteen while the more ethanol you have in the blend the more smog there is which is why you don't see a Fifteen a widespread and even that you can blend\nUm but the they want the Fifteen to be able to be sold year round voluntarily and incentivized through changing the credit situation with those blenders\nWith companies so does it take to complete mandate offer you still mandated to they were ten percent of their the ... the mandate is still ten percent\nSo then it would be Fifteen Percent but the credits would give you the the incentive to do it even though I don't see ah\nThe oil companies are not ... they're not responding to this\nA proposed ah it it is just a proposal now but they're not they're not responding at all they they don't does hair for this idea does does this increased the taxpayer subsidies for ethanol a ... I have not seen that changing the only numbers change in terms of uh I guess\nDollars are changing hands is\nThe credit now you would have to go through of course a Congress to get\nThose subsidies and everything else the president may say I will push for greater subsidies what is pushing for a year on the surface really is selling more ethical\nYeah this is sold job that doesn't well it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't care about the\nCredits they don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them if the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about it in the past raising the mandate right ... percent right well if you do that that becomes say that becomes a big problem politically ... outside of Iowa\nGood I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm going to allow them I'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do\nRight and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback ... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I won't be the largest cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog what gas station is going to be the\nFirst to put wanna put a Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know a a a faster you can damage your lawn mower faster if you use the fifteenth mhm right that it should just be ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it\n... has a lightweight and sleek design with simple pine vibrations and guiding pulses for a puff pick two minute clean\nAnd unlike other high into that she toothbrushes quit stop at just twenty five dollars\nBuzzfeed cools off the iPhone of toothbrushes at time magazine named us one of the best inventions of the yeah stock brushing better with quip\nGo to get ... dot com slash benefit right now and get your first revealed tax free with a quick electric toothbrush that's your first regional pack free at get quick dot com slash benefit spelled G.

is that we're ... smart helping you run more efficiently as ... number one goal our friends in the panhandle one Big Bend area of Florida keeping a watchful eye\nOn hurricane Michael in fact a so was Westwood One meteorologist John ... who joined us live right now good morning John and John\nGood morning guys so yeah we're looking at the possibility now of a major hurricane a a a hurricane at the level free or above that's greater than one hundred ten miles an hour hitting a in in about twenty four hours from now\nWhat changed over I guess a late Sunday and into Monday the forecast seem to change and showed the potential for the energy increasing in Michael what what was it that we were looking at or I guess you guys going we're looking at a that showed that change\nYeah well one of the things that are well a couple of things that will slow down a hurricane would be a wind shear we don't have that one of the things that will slow down a hurricane would be\nColder ocean temperatures we don't have that or lessening of low pressure none of the none of the data that we'd like to see that we'll see uh lessening of strength is a is a part of this particular forecast now\nSo uh that's where we are getting this rapid intensification as we move from a category one\nTo a major category ... storm\nJohn where do you see a hitting on the Florida Panhandle cause most\nLike talking about yeah we're talking about the Big Bend area somewhere between the Appalachian cola which was down on a state road Ninety eight over to um oh just north of saint Petersburg let's say but we are going to see some road closures definitely guys will see I can affect it from Pensacola to Tallahassee\nWe could C sections are by Seventy five shut down the right to in the Georgia or Florida line area so are truckers are going to play an important role in this thing\nGetting supplies in and out of the region there'll be needs for diesel fuel and some rebuilding efforts\nYou know with Florence we talked about the rain event this will be a rain event\nAnd a wind event uh we're looking at the possibility of up to twelve inches of rain all within less than a twenty four hour period of time in that Big Bend area\nWhat about storm surge what is the threat there\nBig time we're looking at a storm surge and a wave heights in and around the a five to twelve foot\nRange with a a major category ... storm so that's going to have its impact certainly coastal erosion will see folks with a coastal interest or with a maritime industry and folks with\nHomes along the returned affected so will definitely see some storm surge effect and I don't believe we have a full moon right now but if we did that would increase\nUnder a higher tide certainly inundation bank grader\nAt this uh Michael is moving quicker though than Florence it's a fast moving hurricane\nYes just slightly faster so it's expected to move into that area and make landfall as I mentioned in the Big Bend area we're looking right now about eight to nine o'clock tomorrow morning and um [noise]\nOr just a hope that everyone hates the warnings is we've got several I mean we're talking thirty six counties I think now check under a some sort of a advisory either get out or get ready to get out and uh of course the state of Florida it's been under the state of emergency now for uh about twenty four hours\nAs we look forward to later in the week we mentioned Florence our friends still in recovery mode after Florence what can they expect in terms of rainfall that might affect him later this week\nYeah we'll see their system move right on up through Georgia and then into portions of South Carolina and particularly southern uh North Carolina so\nNot good news for folks trying to dry out in ... that area from South Carolina into North Carolina\nUh we'll see not to twelve inches but certainly between three and five inches of rain but we got to remember those those are creeks and rivers are swollen there the ground is already saturated so any amount of water\nNot good for the Carolinas\nWestwood One meteorologist drawn trout ain't gotta thank you so much for your time we appreciate it you got guys\nOr John Will be on that

global warming is happening due to human beings he does believe that global warming is happening\nBecause of human beings he doesn't know to what extent it is\nRight but he believes it is but he believes that everything that the left is doing is absolutely wrong so it's a very unique perspective it's yeah I Believe it's happening but everything they're doing is is wrong\nA and\nA writing that the United nations climate parent old declared that because this is really interesting because this I'm sure we'll be part of of this whole thing\nHere this new report fries this was back in September after the post wrote it and lumber go writing that the UN a climate pedal declared in its latest report that we're not seeing an increase in hurricanes current data set syndicate no significant observed trends in global tropical\nOver the past century and Mr lumber said we're seeing an increase in hurricane cost\nBecause we hear that all the time right well the warming I mean look at the hurricane Costa hurricane costs are more than they've ever been before ... he says we're seeing an increase in hurricane cost not because of climate change but because more people with more well live in harm's way and noting that the U.S population rose four fold over the past\nCentury he said he climbed fifty fold in coastal areas the areas hit by Hurricane Florence\nHad fewer than eight hundred thousand homes in Nineteen forty now eleven point three million or one thousand three hundred and twenty five percent increase homes are bigger now and they hold many more expensive possessions\nAdjusted for population and well us hurricane damage has not increased since Nineteen hundred global whether damage as a percent of global GDP actually fell from Nineteen hundred to twenty Seventeen\nSo and I always like I said I I like going to him because he is somebody who believes he can quantify it but he says he believes\nThat that global warming is happening and\nMan has you know something to do with it but doesn't know you know what percentage but he's as you said you can't stop the economy's you can't put people into mass of poverty you can't do these insane things that the left is is they need to do people have to have a quality of life so what you have to do is\nYou have to prevent you've gotta you've you've got to do the preventative things\nThat you need to be doing but everything that the left his too when he criticizes as being absolutely ridiculous [noise] well and and that's\nAgain the proposals over the years have been a remember the former governor of Oregon saying uh we need to ah essentially a decrease the economy and I forget what the number was but it was in I think that's a Thirteen Prieta under like only got on her team right I thought it was right on that but I was thinking Thirteen and and so\nIf you looked at that you're talking about effectively starving people in third world nations\nBecause\nIf you if you are going to do this for the United states it would have to be globally well you do that globally and you you think about where the supply chain in terms of food the most important item in any supply chain\nTo third world nations\nYou look at the breakdown of that\nNot the supply chain itself\nLogistically but the supplies the content within that supply chain diminished greatly that the insanity that is the insanity that they're proposing the fact of the matter is when you have\nPeople who are willing to have a ... intellectually honest discussion about it uh you and I said I'm we don't need to be at the table how about the scientists that are on both sides of this\nHave the discussion but the ... the problem with that as the politically driven the very motivated politically driven\nAgenda inside of that to the extent that Al Gore by the way why in the world was she telling the UN and why why isn't anyone even listening to Al Gore who admitted\nBack in two thousand ten that he lied about ethanol as we try this altogether\nA it's a it just to read a couple more sentences or from Carolina\nA coat Carolina\nCoast online dot com and uh and it's an article a rich and storms worse and a and a talking about the Washington Post saying that the president President Trump is complicit ...\nAnd and he's and he said you're studying uh twenty six team in the Stanford law review that said we call a shooting\nIn the September fifteenth and sixteenth Wall Street weekend edition columnist Holleman Jenkins we've quoted him alive and contrasted an archaeological study of the first century a de Germans who raised dwelling mounds and built dikes in response to rising sea and storm blood levels\nHe compared to what the us response or brushing them with federal dollars to rebuild so the next storm will always have something bigger and more expensive to knock down and setting a twenty six teams studying the Stanford law review that said we call weather related catastrophes natural natural disasters but the losses are often do to questionable government policies\nHe said Congress struggled for years to reform the national flood insurance program and has turned it into a perverse subsidy per coastal development\nYou quoted Bob sheets then head of the national Hurricane Center saint after Nineteen Seventy nine hurricane Frederick\nIt was like an urban renewal program out there he said that the uh twenty Fifteen a A R worldwide and insurance consultancy said climate change it's not climate change but the growing number and value of coastal properties has the largest factor impacting hurricane risk today a whopping Seventeen trillion\nIn property now exist inside the U.S storm surge zone\nWhere is Al Gore when you need to be continued All right the climate change crowd\nHas become enamored of coastal development because it creates a constituency for doing something about climate change well not exactly for doing something about climate change but for throwing more money at coastal dwellers and calling them victims of climate change for the benefit of generating media coverage\nOf climate politics yeah wow yeah no that's a oral genius ... altogether\nBecause think about what that what what is done\nYou know if you if you look at that and and that's that's what happens if you look at those you know the the wealth that was created\nUm and is very much displayed on the east coast with people that have the home setting I mean if you've got a beach house think about the value of a beach house right what that would be now think about what it takes to replace that right\nNot just insurance but then there has to come after the insurance there has to come public aid\nInevitably well the left has used that uh and the emotion behind that\nBecause who doesn't want to help well then it is okay this is because there is this happening because\nOf climate change and so not only will we again continue the public said that's not going to go away but on the other side of that it's to poor public money into\nIn tax greatly the American people based on the theory of man made climate change which is to say oh I don't know we'll start with forty or fifty bucks a gallon tax\nWill start\nWith and that that won't be the end of the tax I mean if you if you look at it there'll be tax and this is why they wanted you know that it's not necessarily because of climate change it's because you can you can implement the taxation\nAt levels before the retail level\nIt becomes a compounding tax like the vat tax this is the kind of policy that they want until you have a centrally tax the poor especially in the middle class because those are the groups\nThat are affected immediately and greatest then they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they quote a home and Jenkins from the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damage by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths same vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increase wetlands\nTo handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies would encourage building in vulnerable areas and mentioning that every news site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about hurricanes\nMr home and said major storms have become events\nThey afford great footage which feeds a false sensation viewers at storms have become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with they'd because CNN is not president\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon production is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards living rationally\n\nMexican native ... individual results may vary see what's at pretty down [noise]\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see without my glasses I Can't

concerned a lot of our listeners who are very concerned saying you know ... ... what's going on with the Pfizer worn thing it just disappeared what happened and what we did cover it a couple of times and ah you know over the last\nCouple of weeks but just to just to go over it again\nSo everybody knows and maybe do it in a little bit more detail here where we can spend a little bit more time on it or the the the president or was going to declassify\nA roughly Twenty one pages including the Pfizer application\nAnd at the last minute before releasing it he decided not to and he didn't release it because he said\nAre there were some of our allies to did not wish us to release it so he wasn't going to do and yet when we read it we thought OK they what are they trying to do figure out of some of the classified information should stay out\nYou know ... or ... should than they need to read that more and that's was I think our original thought ... and then the president said I'm going to give it to further review\nTo the inspector general of the department of justice Michael Horowitz\nWell we immediately said wait a minute and even Devin Nunes has like the day after said you know I don't know why they won't release it and then we thought\nTo ourselves well wait a minute and this is the least covered story in America right now I think mhm the least\nThe the lady made on the road I read her radio exclusive [laughter] have the covered about possibly the most important story in all of this over the last two years is that the president because he said and we were and and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain\nBecause of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to\nA release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded go we couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why would they go to the inspector general and all the sudden it was data that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this\nAnd tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can under a deck you use that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence year CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now but you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to to do is to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you were secretary of state former CIA director because they claimed that some allies or didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are

it's quite simple ... we debate over things and here's what we debate one one case when you were if you want to look in simplify it and just do a couple of words\nYou know in in a very short sentence what we were what we were dealing with the left basically said if you believe in due process you believe in the rape of women\nMhm that's really what mhm\nThat was what the left which dating to us that's unacceptable that was ... when you say things like that Denver fighting words well they do yeah those are words that up those are words that get people upset it is a charge\nToo when you when you make it at ... and it was made by Democrats ... because the simple thing is people have said I because I Believe in due process does not mean I don't sympathize\nWith ... with a with rape or sexual assault survivors of course I Do but I also believe in due process under the law and you can do both and the ... was attempting to tell you that you must always believe the woman well come on

were jak the spirit of the constitution that you were jak the presumption of innocence\nAnd then the allegation that was thrown that if you believe in due process than you believe in rape and sexual

mean November ninth\nOkay warning at sixteen [laughter] the day after the election because let's let's talk about better let's talk about the reaction that started a actually late that night but I mean if you think about the election wasn't cold until\nNovember night or so technically it started [laughter] November night\nBut you could see the faces being made ... in the evening of November rate\nWill split those hairs later but the whole bitter end thing\nSay what you will about this current president and I'm sure he has Mr Redford but the whole thing with pretty much every day since he

let's discuss bitter and Mr Redford\n[noise] well I I just I get a kick out of it because I I Do believe people lack courage\nWhen they they try to sell you the propaganda that I'm rise above all of this and I'm call calling for love\nFor between everybody and to stop all of the ... and the anger and the the the bitterness without directly addressing an issue to me\nThat is the height of whipping this is not willing to actually look stand up for what you believe in if you believe is right and just defended and get specific about it but don't throw me this crap and not get it all the time I Know a couple of\nOf a Facebook friends who do it I'm going to rise above all of this no you're not\nWell simply let me ask you Mr Redford I'm ah was it rising above when the Democrats out at Dr Ford or was it rising above wouldn't chairman Grassley decided that they were going to delay the process\nAnd give Dr Ford in front of the American people or even behind closed doors that was her choice to issue her concerns and make her claim officially wants it\nBitter was it divisive\nWhen the president himself decided he would order an additional background check on Kavanaugh delaying it even further was that divisive\nAh when Bernard Goldberg wrote the book by us he talked about the elites are in in the media in Hollywood and everything else that believe they're not part of either side they just believe that they are part of the absolute right ... you know that they just believe that they're right in everything than their opinion\nIs above everyone else that in essence while you called them the elite because they believe they're on a higher plane of consciousness\nWhere oh we just call for civility and the way that we think and just follow what we do when everything will be\nOkay so they don't for ripe red for here for example doesn't have to get specific he just puts out this general statement we know where he stands everything where he stands as is addressed you know is meant for the Republicans and he's not insulting the Democrats here and everybody knows that but he doesn't have the guts to say it\nRight\nWell because he talks in these generalities that are straight from Hollywood script without without going on detail by detail or mission to say what was done wrong in this process I can tell you what was done wrong in this process\nAnd it's by the side that you support but you aren't big enough\nTo actually stand up and say it Robert Redford in this instance Taylor Swift has more guts than you do what I Am right now [laughter]\nUm [noise] that

rhetoric that if the Democrats take the house they still plan on impeaching a impeaching cabin on teaching from ... main page in the cabinet impeaching the Congress impeached\nDiana ... branch altogether we're going to do I remember doing whatever they want to do away with the allies it on college or do away with the president said I haven't heard the president's yet either when do we just come up did we just make that one up with I have no no no remember I didn't hear that\nThey they the office of the President's Day we should do away with it that was a few weeks ago remember when they were saying we should totally do away with the office of the presidency and that's about the same time that Michael Moore said it's over you had someone saying well we don't you know this is the this is the problem\nWith a member of that yeah oh yeah hey yes and I would change that because All right I've played out a lot so after the nomination\nYeah\nSo I don't know the presidency\nDelivering court the president's the Senate does the constitution or they don't want to get rid of the Supreme Court they just want to get rid of the Supreme Court in in the manner that it exists today they well they want to leave three intact no they [laughter]\nAnd we think we know which loosely here some of the things I've come up with and we're not kidding they really they really talked about the fact of thank you for reminding me of the president won I forgot about that and getting rid of the presidency mhm\nGetting rid of the Senate yes that came out yesterday there over the weekend from the NBC reporter [laughter] besides just unfair uh Rhode Island shouldn't have as many senators ... as a as as California right and so get rid of get rid of the Senate get rid of the presidency\nGet rid of the electoral college and turn the Supreme Court into a liberal legislative branch in\n[noise] yes well\nYou know what I picture average car wore scene I don't really follow Star Wars closely and I have to admit that my uh my youngest daughter is a huge fan so I Will take her to the movies\nI I I don't pay attention as closely as I should let's just say that but at some point there was a well Samuel L. Jackson and some others is a true story was sitting there and they were all you know I don't know it's the jet I counselor whatever whoever their whatever their ... and making all the decision forth\nYou know and that's what it would be in by the way I think we're going to do that it should include Samuel L. Jackson [laughter] I mean if we're going to go that direction but the but it's it is this well you know do away with the borders ... do ... do away with the borders\nAre we want to do away with the constitution [laughter] ah do away with the center\nOf a\nYou know if they lose the house hold it you know if they lose the house you're not going to be that way that we were talking earlier in the show about you know what are the issues for the Democrats\nYeah go the route everything get rid of the United states yeah because they wish to get rid of the presidency they wish to get rid of the Senate that they wish to get rid of the electoral college they wish to make this the Supreme Court the liberal legislative branch they wish to get rid of borders\nYeah by the way this we're not making these things up you know what it would you guys are exaggerating here's the thing\nHere's here's what's it going to promote it's going to be like the ... from a Stephen King I like where basically I just that movie yeah where you're just going to have some pac man like entities and I don't even know what they were really horrible CGI at the end I was ... up everything just her yet where let's just do away with everything\n[laughter]\nIt is it is the equivalent of I didn't when I'm taking my toys and I'm going oh\nWell now let's now let's let's let's be fair here because they've talked about not all of them uh but but look you know it it's something the electoral college I mean that's becoming more mainstream now in the Democratic party right and then as we said the next thing would be the Senate and the NBC reporter said look the Senate eventually has to go\nAnd now that has been the topic of discussion okay she'll be get rid of the Senate and because we need one person one vote one person\nAnd so what you're what you're doing is you're saying the constitutional republic that we live under which is the United states of America that the United states America has to go\nSo we chose the talk was get rid of the presidency get rid of the electoral college get rid of the Senate or make the Supreme Court a liberal legislative\nA ah a branch get rid of\nAll borders and at the same time uh provide all health care to people yeah all college to people [laughter] everything is free yes so get rid of the United states and make everything free right I'm running for Congress right Liza like me right\nWell my question [laughter] who's going to be there to give it to you I don't know no one if there's a ... if there's anarchy and there's no right if there's no real\nUm 'cause I feel like that's what you're going to get because by the way we're never going to get all those were not getting rid of the Senate ... we're getting an accurate might get rid of some in the Senate [laughter] but no but here in four weeks but it's but it's worth going now and I think it's very important because we did ask\nWhat is the issue the issue is that the ... not the Republicans just to Republicans but the ... states has failed and it goes to the power to look into that you've you follow the narrative the founding fathers were flawed they were slave owners therefore anything that they created should be dissipated\nAnd everything that they came up with is wrong the electoral college was only there to protect slavery in the Senate was only there to protect slavery in that scenario that you're getting it's not true but that's the narrative that you're getting a ... from them from them now so right\nAh it's interesting let's destroy the entire country that's just because that's what you'd be doing much destroyed the concept of our constitutional republic destroy it and give everybody stuff for free\nYes or anybody in with that\nBut I don't know what are we going to do 'em all get together and go loot Citibank [laughter] there's not going to be any there anybody there to the\nFederal government had a federal government has to give them their charter right\nSo I don't know how it's going to work maybe like a western okay so we all get horses\nBand Iraq back to barter system Mm\nWhere you go you go into town with your wagon load up some flour and sugar and licorice whip yes and then you tell the there'll be plenty of general store owner [laughter] and then at ... at a cigar then if it's going to be a general or if it's going to be a Clint Eastwood movie\nThen you tell the general store owner that you will uh be by on friday to pay him with a goat\nWell you know it it just shows the insanity because that's where we're at and you and I played earlier we had to do because we didn't get chest plate last week the case of Cortez ... are talking about how you know what has to be improved in Congress and it was just a bunch of bladder it made no sense at all and uh we just finished say we went\nAfter we've finished we want what was that well it's like somebody tried to explain to her organizing and\nIn people to the polls but that's not how it came out she she can use it with that's how she would run ... right yeah it was just it would just bizarre and um\nOr veterans were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life let them know
