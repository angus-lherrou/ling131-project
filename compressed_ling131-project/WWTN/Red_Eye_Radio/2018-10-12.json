trade war and terror that's a tax increase tax increases are not good a ... raising the cost of goods and services irrespective of the slogan to do it as\nIrrespective of the slogan that is used to justify to do it ... economics doesn't care about a slogan\nNo in it or you look at the dynamics of of that situation where are you have producers here on the U.S or that have their cost there they're all materials costs going up\nA PG for example but then of course the cells that are lost and the exports\nAre from the retaliatory tariffs from the other side\nAnd and then the dynamics of the pricing\nSo you want the the product from wherever it is\nOutside the u._s. and you pay your going to pay because of the tariff right and then the producer at the domestic producer of a similar product\nBecause part of it is protectionism then they're going to raise their prices because you know they're being hurt so they're justified in raising their prime because they can and because they can and all they have to be as a penny cheaper than the foreign product\nTo be competitive chummy chummy why that's a positive\n\nAh we have stated that are all along and I do think that again the uncertainty because still today Congress completely silent mhm uh on the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA ...\nA a steel tariffs aluminum tariffs which adds to the base cost of how many thousands tens of thousands of products out there\nWhich as we've seen in a and I don't know I haven't seen an update on it we know that\nIn the first half of the year steel was forty percent mhm uh we know that the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\nDoes not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal the tariffs from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins and some of those cases still\nRemain with Canada and\nMexico so you know we said that when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA for the most part they're really much is it much of a difference ah\nYou you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA now he\nDid a little bit but he didn't do anything that he planned that he\nSaid he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit right that this that this isn't going to do it there were little winds here or there the problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem\nIs and the president views it as a victory is raising the cost\nOr to buy a car in Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car therefore making it more expensive to buy a car and making it\nLess likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas\nHas just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right\nIt's the one thing they're ... they're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I've no idea where the president stands on it\nAs we know he's changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week he'll go from as you did one for me in a complete protection is just sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that in this in the the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA\nThat he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America he put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're ... babies\n[laughter] the original ... the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many farmers were laughing at\nThat comments a while because in the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on to ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the the the the the fuel producers don't don't want it they don't want the higher blend\nIt it may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes the lawsuit here comes the lawsuit here comes a lawsuit\nUm but it will the but even because that's a refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend but when there's no market for it than there would be a ... a glut of the product and for the consumer that temporarily my might be a good thing\nBut the point is we're not going to get to a Fifteen\nWith out a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt\nYou can't get that done it too so but appeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the terrorists and then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said\nThat's a tiny number compared to what\nWe're we're losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chain they're going to go somewhere else so it's not just well the tariffs hurt us until they're lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because these countries\nDon't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal you know or or the the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to uh to\nTo terrify you're not an double anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exact and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious the president used the greatest victory\nAnd that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories and their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services but we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can't figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question\nMhm\nYeah I mean bands at when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork or as we call it Canadian Bacon and the when they set up that supply chain that they're happy with that agreement why did they go back to us for\n\nWhat would they are with any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else are we said this\nDuring the you know the um during the permit tore him after the uh the when when the Gulf spill happened\nThe BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies the producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us a permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right and so\nYou're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy uh you know on a\n... at the snap of finger and and frankly\nThe ethanol thing has become you know ... for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking the political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa I mean and\nFor those people that the New York times or listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is there is a state in the middle of the country\nBut when you go there it is\nAll connected to farming just like Texas has oil\nDirectly or indirectly I mean that is the driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt that's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically votes\nWhat

around the world how long lived is that it is the president's a trip as he announced on a Thursday morning it was going to try and go into China mhm right so how\nLong is a I guess this going to to last that the market you what you're looking at a earnings reports the Bee Gees ten percent drop was based on what happened to them and the third quarter in that situation has not changed at this point\nOr because they they talked about three dynamics there and that's raw materials a freight uh and and the and oil costs um\nIf the president gets to China they get a deal done on tariffs\nOh just a it was just\nSomething it at Business Insider talking about the uh what is going on right now with a you know with trying to their exports to the U.S continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they say they're still moderate least strong\nWell it doesn't change the the uh trade deficit right a scenario is is not\nLikely to change it wasn't going to change with the\nNew NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table but with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property consider mhm that's the real thing that the president has to address I mean the terrorist thing is going to have to be remedied but\nIt's going to they're going to have to there is going to have to be\nAnd it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to where it was announced that the\nPresident would be going to try to sit down with a she in China well that's we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying this can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules\nThe\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see you're going to see an adjustment on the stock market in the stock market is the least of your concerns the reason it's adjusting as because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned\nUh the fed with interest rates are the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to to go up or the Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and\nAnd and our enabled and it has changed and it is an incentive a a\nAgain

something that you were promoted did you hear Trump's response ...\nFor all mhm well then you're going to destroy the system for old people oh sure yeah I went whoa I mean that was a group that was a great political responds all the ...\nFrom the president I went whoa mhm my Medicare for all the new kill than than you are destroying Medicare for old people because we can't pay its you're going to be taken from them and it was set up for them or not for not not for the rest of America\nIt was set up specifically for them you do it you heard old people open pool that was just ... and I thought that was a great political age I think it's a\nGreat response remember when when they were talking about slowing the rate of growth this was Paul Ryan slowing the rate of growth of Medicare there were a they depicted him and ads as wanting to kill old people\nBut\nWhich side isn't that says oh people should go home and die\nWe're not gonna you know afford all the technology and medications were going to send you home so you can die that was Robert Reich ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Barack Obama again saying the same thing\nThey don't care about the fact that\nElderly people will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all you can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part or half of it\nAnd pure fantasy\nBut what would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the old ...\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does elect care about field well

emissions who is number one\nWas a candidate nope no nope Germany nope Australia nope France no\nThe one country that pulled out all the phony Paris climate accord reduced as carbon emissions by ... percent the most of all major countries in the world\nSo the rest of the uh the the rest of the countries are joining groups United States has now we're not gonna join the groups because they're signing up there because there's got to there's they're signing things were actually doing things and why what's the main reason why the United states has done it\nFracking bragging racking\nPratt in fracking fracking fracking fracking fracking so the people that actually\nVoted in a way\nTo get the substance of how we do after our energy that actually voted for the policies that made it so we can

going to get to in fact the United states blows them away\n\nThe people that actually do the job and get the job done this are viewed as the people that are destroying the world where all the

I'm right they will start seeing that but we haven't\nSeen any polls post cabinet ... we don't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them\nOn on our cp that's thirty two uh the the polls in those areas you know it in those thirty two districts\nAre really going to start juggling things are showing something here probably by the time you and I get back a week from Monday or\nWhen when I start thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows\nBut all I'm thinking is that if you've got ten to twelve percent that are undecided it means they're not driven by Trump hatred or Trump bluff right it's not either of that that's driving them so what is it that is what is it that is driving\nYou know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that lets pull the independence ... congressional district to find out why they are undecided and what would change their vote right would it be in their local congressman came out and said\nEverything is free but by this time they've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge to build a certain way especially if they're likely voters\nWhich means in all likelihood they're going to vote ... but they're still undecided at this moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yep and what's the hugest ... issue over the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks\nWill be ... I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody\nKanye West ah [laughter] right [laughter] I'm Sorry

that\nStill love him but it's not going to change what's it think about it who is in this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and debt and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at\nThe end and it's just one small indicator it's a small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely\nDemocrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans\nAnd the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two and a two yes I Would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up but from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I

great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and the court of public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process such a ... that's a\nYou know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's yeah I I think it is and\nAnd people apply it uh it based on their their own life you know our ... our audience a and a ... and new sounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it and we're\nAlways immersed in it but most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of boating they look at it and\nSay okay this this is you know insanity\nThe fact that it went this way they don't uh apply the ... believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings sleep\nThat is the case for some but most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote was a big deal and if they are to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is one of those\nPolls start to shape the way they do and that's why a likely voter gives you a better read but\nThey look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan they're driven by whatever imagery but we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day\nLike we are for whatever reason but they will show up and they make an informed decision\nAnd often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a ... and and Chuck Todd who's saying well a lot of people get it wrong in\nAnd say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary that was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because\nThey are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house and Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what\nChuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left ...\nYou know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the caller there and and I think you can't underestimate this\nIs that Americans may not know the three branches of government right uh you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or ... zero but they couldn't tell you all three\nAs you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process think about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV and Donald salt [laughter]\nWell a lot of well I'll Try

in\nNot just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our popular culture shock for me ... I'm ...\nAnd it's a great point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation works for no the three branches of government do but in pop culture we got we got those and yes they

in a tightly contested US Senate race implied that her home state produced quote crazy in a ... eleven speech\nIn which he promised to advised liberal activists how to stop your state from becoming Arizona\n\nSome critics are comparing the remarks to Hillary Clinton's infamous comments about Trump supporters bean deplorable ... an edited version of her speech to the Texas stonewall democratic clock as a Democrat L G Beatty group\nAh in Texas was posted on Twitter on Thursday by an anonymous conservative group a longer version of the speeches available on YouTube\nOr in the speech she recounts how she was taught as a young at a young age that Arizona was known for five sees cattle topper citrus caught and and climate but I Would add a six see she added it's called crazy\n\nA set of all one time Green Party activists has fashioned herself as a moderate\nWilling to work with both parties in her contest where fellow us representative Martha ... apparently not yeah uh the thing is I had the audio but it's really low so I'll just a ... a originally quote right\nRight right okay that just I play the audio but it's just it was you know they don't hear her as much you because someone is is recording to get you hear that people closer yeah of course and record on your show yeah\nUh\nOver the past here's a quote over the past several years people would watch what's happening in Arizona and be like damn those people are crazy is it something about the water no the water's fine we stole it from Colorado there's nothing wrong in the water\nThere's something wrong with the people in office in Arizona and and that's the end of quote than a new quote and people say oh the Tea Party the Tea Party please those people have been in charge\nFor like Twenty years in Arizona there called Republicans\nTea Party Republican it's the same thing it's called crazy and to quote\n\nAlright inner speech he attacked the Thames by Republican state legislature in Arizona the

you go calling the people of Arizona craze\n\nWe would suggest to the mix Sally campaign well if you if you want if your goal is to work in the Senate\n... the the United States Senate\nAnd represent the people of Arizona just the just for starters don't call the people of that state crazy\nYou know in a time she focused in on the Republicans by the time she did not when she ...\nShort so assuming she because she's probably going to say well Republicans are crazy\nBut she's ... that that might\nBe how she defends herself which by the way well she does well that would hurt her because she's trying to position herself as somebody who is by ... so just assume that okay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking\nAbout the crazy Republicans well not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior
