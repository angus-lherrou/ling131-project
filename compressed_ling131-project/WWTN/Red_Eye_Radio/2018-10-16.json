on why people like him I get it you're going to stick to your Republican he's a Republican representative here's our president he's for that party\nWill do everything that this man does is not right

there's no issue about that at all\nWhat you said we we back Trump if in what things don't you like that but you know well we should clarify differences I'm not gonna argue with you but what you think he believes in or has done that you don't like so much\nYou know got everything I mean I I really I Can't even believe it or not because\nThey want her name name oh no no no ... mark okay\nLet me let me let me just tell you that's are quick\nUm I I don't get and maybe you can answer me I don't know um\nIf he had if he did something we're not going to find any proof direct proof that he had anything to do with the election like Trump himself um but there was um I mean voter fraud everything going on why would Hillary we our president at that but the case\nWay to say I'm just wondering like there's some you know your your last me do I want to answer your question has often been voter fraud that that's you you can't blame that on President Trump the collusion with Russia there's been zero estimates that ... has been going on two years\nSo there's been no zero evidence of that is that what you're saying about that they're going to go for the\n... yeah so how how is it that every person he is involved with um is going to jail\nOr going to hurt during ...\nSo how are you where the ...\nAnd yeah so it would no that wasn't the all the people that have gone to jail a lot of them are Russians when they mentioned this thirty six thirty nine some of these people Russians having nothing to do with President Trump but Michael Flynn a pleaded not not because he had anything to do with the Russians Paul Manafort they with some\nYou know business dealings he didn't report when you're ... none of these things out and if you do with President Trump\nOr Syria saying why all the people everybody knows first of all it's not every but it's just we're talking about some people but none of it was with President Trump colluding with Russia you let me ask you questions all week and you really believe\nThat he quoted we've put in I mean we've had zero evidence of that yes\nAbsolutely I absolutely do and I believe I Believe they'll have proof of that and if they don't it's like with that Kevin I kept going back to that I go back to that but with Kevin ... it was it was a disgrace to say oh we we we believe Kevin a hundred percent but Ford\nOh we're building hurt cute but but um it just wasn't him and and that's\nThat's who we are getting a chance that made me think I may even carry you offer\nBut the fact is that there was no cooperating evidence for anything she said would you like I hate me it was huge wait let me finish would you like to think of something and have no corroborating evidence and then maybe go to jail or not get the job you always want that in this country you're innocent before proven guilty you got to let me\nLet me let me tell you I yes in the wrong person because I was in and I just ... dead and my family have a family member if I were

bay of ... you know they go out to these cocktail parties are dinners and ... come up to you if you're a senator or or if you're in the government so this is so crazy for ... for the last two years

Department and in the FBI not the regular members and the FBI we're trying to get depressed and trying to undo the results of the election\nSo brings me back to where I started which is I think it's

year he would have you on a more often panel of two or three of you there\nBut I'm the guy you had so many wonderful cause tonight it has been amazing and uh the last caller I'm Glad they squeeze that into it they had very circular very condemning their reasoning was just little or I thought patterns\nAre like Rachel Maddow hour or something they're trying to educate on bone and then said doesn't matter well neither America and that's why we have a great\nA system as the next plane that so but even the caller said and this is a combination ah I'm thinking in remarks Edwin calling for last hour the guaranteed says yeah we haven't had to have a billboard or a bumper sticker idea\nYeah we have to have Trump speak up and do something like JFK said isn't weren't your country can do for you but what can you do for your country yeah we have to\nPreserve the republic vote American uh we just can't run this country willy nilly it takes a businessman and knows how to produce and uh\nUh if the opposition had so many shovel ready jobs and all these concepts in the past why hasn't anything work for them it's very little and very costly very costly it's it's like the healthcare system they're trying to push on is\nIt is not health insurance is just to program it's just a plan\nFor single payer now that I I Wish them talking and think tank guys like you could get together and mark and I'm

mark\n[noise] yeah Hi yeah you're you're in a good job [noise] um yeah I I I think it's funny it's like uh\nI'm In I'm In the medical field but I it's like to figure out some of those people you need to have a degree in psychology I think but I'm like ah that one girl I I don't know there's two ... two kinds of liberals are the kind that are just kind of\nIgnorant or naive and then there is the kind that you want to they don't like the way the country it and they want to change it and um they're both dangerous but um that would be the left is probably that are the most dangerous warranted want it you know they don't believe in capitalism and\nNow they want to change on country yep you're right\nYeah here in Trump's doing a great job and people if if the people don't want to give them credit or they they say something about the tax break not working then why don't they just don't eat the rest of the money write a check to the government didn't give it back home\nAnd narrow you either that or they can move to Canada so\n[laughter] yeah no I I I Do people have said that they always but liberals or the left I should be clear about that's the last one they want to use your money and the things they believe and they don't want to write that check themselves right\nIt's just like to think about the I talk about illegal immigration all the time and they say oh you know you can't do that you can't build the wall but they live behind gated houses right yeah so what's good for them is not good for us right is it is a double standard that so I like your ... yeah you don't have to land writing personal checks yeah\nHey thanks very much mark for your for your call\nAlthough he did suggest that I missed that that we need a psychologist no we\nJust had that in Ford right she was a wasn't she psychologist maybe she was professor I Can't remember ... or the combination man and see what was yesterday's news it's over with let's go to David in uh oh you're getting into one of the subjects I didn't get to but I was going to\nMaybe tomorrow David in price middle Tennessee you're on with mark\n... markets it's a pleasure to speak with you I'm this wall first of all all of us have been used throughout history of civilized man to keep people out or to keep people and for defensive purposes\nAnd the if walls didn't work why do are a a high ... high value prisoners kept high walls\nAnd then secondly the cost of the wall itself\nWould pay for itself and savings of cost of crime in this country the cost of court all the litigation everything ... if that was put in place and monitored but that would be cut drastically and the the money that's currently being spent\nOn those activities in addition to extra a law enforcement uh it it would pay for itself we wouldn't that wherever else Mexico fan for our savings would pay for it and the crime rate would go down everything would be better with that well and uh\nI don't know why I gotta you gotta wonder you gotta wonder why why does Israel have a wall right worse if you have to have the enemy\nWalls or proven that fits method that they have to be monitored and reinforced if someone breaches it\nBut it Ninety percent of the better of the people who are just war going across the border now would not be able to do so it would not be able to come in and terrorize our citizens are those that come for various reasons\nAnd I just it makes no sense to me that someone would even have the audacity to suggest that a wallet\nIt will work it will work but because of the the political ambitions of other of absurd leftist groups they don't want to stop it\nAnd the young lady that spoke earlier is so naive\nAbout everything even even with the uh uh she she she failed to mention that there were the the very witnesses that Dr Ford called and said we're there every one of them denied it happened these were her supposedly her with says I Know I got off the subject\nAnd she does have two degrees in psychology and she is a\nShe came across to me is having some real fundamental psychological problems herself\nDid you ever hear I I don't want to pick on her I don't want to pay her right now much out of my own take on her I think the whole thing no I'm not up yeah I well I'm not I'm not afraid of\nPicked on her but at the point I was going to make as many people say they go into psychology because they've had their own issues and then they'd have\nTo make money I can make money on this as well make a whole a whole lot of\nUs should be struck chips [laughter]\nWe we are in our own way

[noise]\nSmart for back with you again taking your calls ... one of the stories that were in the was in the news today so Michael of an audience last another one huh Stormy Daniels if you haven't heard this live a lawsuit over we by Donald Trump\nAccusing her of a total ... job was thrown out by a judge who said the president was engaging in free speech\nOr the adult film stars real name is Stephanie Clifford claimed she was threatened by no no man\nNo man in Las Vegas parking lot in two thousand eleven or for a green to cooperate with a magazine article about Trish she said she had with Trump in two thousand six after lawyer released a composite sketch or the man Trump accused Clifford in April tweet of a total Punjab concerning uh non existent man\nAnd one of the court decide the

will appeal the dismissals a defamation cause of action and are confident\nAnd a reversal there's I Love the skull listen to this quote there is something really rich in Trump or lying in the first

the judge reward a Trump reasonable attorneys' fees also\nAnd his lawyers and no amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer ... can truthfully characterized that he's really in any way other than total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels and he didn't add\nA her lawyer boy when I look to see him get the Democratic nomination for president maybe we'll do that tomorrow ask you who you prefer to get the nomination but here's someone who disagrees with me let's see if I can find them again yeah Robin Boise idaho robbed Iran will mark\nFails go they're strict Michael\nI I'm just happy to instill some common sense in a show uh I I think Trump is absolutely abhorrent a I got a laundry list I won't go through them all but the the barbaric handling of immigrant children disgusting\nUm there is at Youtube video I've seen and believe me I Believe you don't believe me it's been taking off for you to have\nA talk show years ago I Believe it was a David Letterman where he said in a slug arrogant way I'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian or can\nYou hold on I Want to just I'll give you a chance what you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrant children first of all they're not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children\nOr let's call them the way it is and I don't know what's ... why it's barbaric to say that you have certain rules and laws and ways of getting in a country and if you don't come in that way then we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe his parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being\nA separate and broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you would probably call me barbaric just 'cause I Want some rules and I want some uh procedures in terms of sovereignty why is that barbaric\nI don't care what the children belong to the handling was barbaric and if it was your child you'd be singing a different you\nKnow I Want you know no no no you don't have to go on you don't run around you know you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance when you say something so absurd if it was my first I Want to bring my child's us here if I knew they could be separated from me\nI Would do in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you a chance\nBut don't try to read my motivation on my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules in our procedures and it's not barbaric to say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your return\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say it is or not the way they handled it not necessarily joining it in the first place separating the show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation will be warranted it's the way they they uh they say half bought\nHandled it let's just say for instance I'll be real quick I took my kid Chuck E. cheese recently I had a bracelet said one two three for example at my childhood and prices at once you three\nWalk him aspirin

go to a\nIn doraville Georgia Darryl Darryl you're on with more\nAnd more like a well I got to say is that uh your last caller and the young lady before a earlier than I a typical people who'll amongst my peers I've noticed that\nThey hate Trump so much that they're ... they can't really articulate why but there are reasons they give some time prove with other people's point like mine where he was talking about the immigration or\nMaybe they're not immigrants because\nThe next as soon as I say that right he's an immigrant because he came here legally\nWell I served I married my wife overseas I got married when I see people coming over here at the I have to pay all that money and go to forgive her over here and help people jump in front of the line because they came here because it's your graphical ...\nI mean people got to realize\nAmerica is a country of laws\nAnd this man is trying to make sure that laws are enforcing the Constitution's fall and the problem is we got people who have been\nA benefiting from the law being broken in a in a Democratic Party wants to make sure that the state's broke up because just recently are uh uh the woman run a favorite was running for governor she admitted she oil illegal aliens or is she called them undocumented people to vote\nI mean it's just ridiculous what about\nSharing edited she added it how\nShe thought maybe oh yeah she she had me they bought stocks nudity back when Steve ... a ... interview up writer Kevin she ... they showed the video and I'm a truck driver so I Can't watch it all the time because I'm On my work I work right now\nUh worked at a early morning ships that morning what I'm saying I'm I'm telling you right now I Believe and what the president's do that's why I voted for I don't think he's a racist at all as a matter of fact as a black man or I Would never\nIt was about maybe like Fifteen sixteen years ago in double ACP gave him an award how come you hear all these other people call him a racist but how come you don't hear them speaking up saying he is but they won't even to stand them either because if it's convenient\nI think for people to just put a label on people without any proof that's right you know ... it's just it's just it's just ridiculous and uh he has done more for this country middle last president did in ... years and I'm the I'm going to tell you right straight out\nObama was the worst president ever\nAnd you'll be surprised may not want to ... or you may be surprised\nNo you haven't heard me 'cause I've been on a number of years but until recently not back on this network\nA I feel the same way I think President Obama is the worst presidents we've had in our history certainly in my lifetime he did more damage and he started by apologizing for the greatest country in the history of the world he was ... going on our apology tour uh I I agree I was wondering\nAbout that one before Saudi king and which is ridiculous but I I like what Trump you alluded to in his speech a couple of weeks ago a and the un I well I got out of this speech was one of the things he didn't exactly say it but what I took from it\nWhen you say it's going to make America great again it was letting people know why don't you let your country great again and make it a place that people wouldn't want to leave\nYou know I thought about that\nWhat we've done that works so well right free enterprise little regulation limited government why don't you try that for a while the guys and see how it works in your country I\nExactly and ... and ... and go I go back to the immigration boy that guy said to go to the kids were treated the old policy was put in place long before Trump became president\nThat's right and as a matter of fact\nA lot of those a lot of those kids coming across\nThere may may not even be those ... or a so called adult children it's quite up somebody a Walker cause we saw it on the videos was what are some of the people from Syria which just picking kids\nWalking across the order to get into some of these places and I didn't belong there so you don't know who these people are and in Mexico as a matter of fact treats the people that come across the board of legal me if I'm On doors El Salvador ... operate automotive they treat them like garbage\nAnd they're very harsh than I Am so hey Dr Gerald we yeah we we got

have\nTo put you on hold if you don't get me a chance to respond to ... or if you're if you know that's okay we we all get heated if you're an Israeli ah family living on the other side of the border it's working because your kids are not things that\nThey're living I don't they don't care if it works overtime I don't I don't even conceive that you're right you're starkly in in some ... you know certainly hasn't worked in Rome and some other places but\nIt's working right now you're saving lives of the Israelis how could you say it's not working who said they wish they knew who cares overtime I'm saving my kids live\n[noise]\nYour point is is that over time they don't work\nOkay I I don't want to just because I gave him a chance to open up and you know we're just going in circles or I don't even know if he's right\nBut you can't say if I if I was an Israeli family and I see the walls preventing someone to get in the the hurt my kids or to to murder us who cares if it's over time you know if he's right twenty ...\nTwenty years later oh meanwhile let's stay alive\nI don't know why but it almost reminds me of Geraldo Rivera on the other arguments about uh illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes percentage wise the Native Americans and I always say\nI don't care if you if you take one life murder one person that would have been murdered who cares if I don't even think that right what who cares if you save all of a wife who cares over time right now I don't even know if he's right there starkly is right in some ways but who cares right now here\nI don't want to keep repeating myself so that was an interesting uh back and forth let's go to Mike in Seattle um you're on with mark Hi Mike\nBut thank you very much the President Trump's party as the party of safety and one thing that the American people that are making this country work is that they watch safety\nThey want every pre active measure that is possible to make this country as safe\nAs possible and that the party of crime is the party a waste of time and I are trying to dig up a crime that Mueller hasn't come up with one yet more sick and tired of that and the voters are going to remember this that they have wasted so much time and this president is the party of safety and that is what we don't\nKnow that might make sense to me a safety and malls do that too by the way a quarter Rico in Clinton, Maryland Rico you're off\nThe mark that last caller ... summed it up best [noise]\nThe the people at the beginning of the hour that maniac woman that called the guy that you spoke to was the bleeding heart liberal these people are dangerously stupid I Am never will you do hear it they can't even put basic logic basic logical things together\nI'm Wondering do they work where do they what these people reside all these people you see ... on the road like idiots or something it feels crazy to even live in a world where people who are like this\nSeriously you I was I wanted you to nail down which you you had to go you know to a commercial at the time I wanted you to nail her down\nOn what did he do wrong of which she could not even like most of them\nEven the ... the stupid celebrity that that you see on the TV they can ain't even they have to have such trumped arrangements syndrome their minds out all over the place like squirrels\nWas so dangerous about them when you were talking to her about the issue about okay do you convince someone with no evidence\nShe she's basically saying yes sometimes there's no evidence how can you can you think about convicted in any one will know or either the conviction how can you think about even\nReacting on Oh yes the assumption of I think you did it that is so crazy and dangerous is one thing for you to sit there and think someone did something it is another thing for you to put forth reactions\nTo now I'm going to react on them that I feel like they did\nIn the world thinks like that these people are unbelievable idiots we have a president just like the last caller was saying cares about this country\nCharities we have people again like we've had so many times were sick of marching into the country that's just one issue on top of everything else we do not want that we want safety\nYour head and this was a country of laws you cannot just\nJump over someone's border that's absolutely astronaut\nDidn't didn't you had last call those sounds like a full grown land now own man who wants to generally we want to protect want to protect our villages want to protect our families and this idiot is talking about oh you know I don't think walls or are you crazy he's probably sitting there with a fence around his house\nYou know if he has a house and everyone should note is basic stuff tonight I Want to see the movie dummy crafts I ... some of the questions that they were asking things which we know already\nBasic things basic things they were covering Maxine Waters\nThe thing that was so disturbing if I took a look at that movie how would like to people why in her district because they were covering this portion with math Maxine Waters [noise]\nPeople who are in our district\nI'm like you mean at some of these people happiness stupid for over ... ... are just about forty years this ... this person has ... has been sitting at making a living off of these people you know getting the votes in staying in office did they not it\nThree or four years ask hey what's being done hey nothing is being done OK world you know what we need to vote for out\nHow do you get up there and just the rhetoric is just the same as when you see I cannot stand it you see people just take for instance you you'll see people who are white and they're calling other people white supremacist\nSo idiotic it's unbelievable why are you saying that you are white yourself you\nIdiot that's been well also Rico you make yeah I'm Sorry go ahead finish her\nAbout well I'll finish up by saying those of us know

right now we're seeing a rise in antifa style where on the other side just this weekend or\nThe Proud Boys quote unquote from New York there's video of them assaulting people on the street so\nI I don't see any draining the swamp and to me it's just politics as usual and unfortunately we're ... I finally just afraid that we're a half to ride this out another six years\nI Hope not I hope there's somebody out there who can uh organizes the the ... the Democratic base and you get the Reagan Democrats back on the Democratic train\nOkay I gave you a gay man ... let me respond to some of your points are with history\nAs hyperbole I'm not going to defend that and he says lots of things you know he's the best of all time or whatever he says it bothers me too we had the biggest crowd ever when it's clearly not the case so you're right about that and and I said we get the whole package\nBut that doesn't change the fact that um in terms of wall he certainly wants to build a wall but you got to get Congress to agree and they haven't agreed yet\nIn terms of lock her up\nI pointed out some of the reasons why I don't want to see her locked up even though she's not above the law because of the chaos who would create and you know it's it's not it's not good it's not good optics to say the least even though she deserves to be locked up for the crime she's committed\n... as far as draining the swamp I think he is doing that is going to do that more in terms of just got to wait till the Mueller investigation is over I think you'll see him get a stronger attorney general and certainly it's clear that people at the highest levels of the FBI and the Justice Department were out to get him and maybe a soft coup occurred\nSo notice you and I don't see things the same way in terms of violence in this country almost all of it as a committed by the left\nVery little unit the infant test smell the Proud Boys whenever they call themselves than just a small little group\nUm I I can compare that to end the for the black lives matter of fact I Can't speak at a college campus and people who share my views cannot speak at a college campus\nWithout being shouted down I mean the it's not even close in terms of what you could say as you may not have heard yesterday show you can't I Would never put a Trump sign on my car in my yard he would be the face there if not worse\nSo I you know you and I it's it's good to clarify this you and I see the world differently and you know tomorrow I'm going to talk about the New York\nOr maybe join us talking about the possible democratic candidates I think you've got a problem there 'cause a lot of them have their issues and I think you may not have heard me say this I think Trump gonna if was held today\nHe easily winning reelection or maybe not easily but certainly would win re election so I guess from a clarification point of view I agree with you that he says things he shouldn't say but you get the whole package you but as a conservative I'm very happy with the way he's govern\nUh\nI I can see that and like I said yeah it's just I I don't see it because I constantly see in the news yeah uh just recently in Kentucky trains laying off\nSix hundred employees there is a West Virginia mine is closing down laying off employees Harley Davidson is laying off employees and he's talking about bringing\nMaking and America a producer again yeah he's\nGetting and all the bidding and all these ... taking with these other countries causing us to lose jobs [noise] that that's\nMy final point I forgot to mention and yeah I well I guess that I enjoy the show and now I'll definitely keep listening on my way home from work or\nThe rest of the week because I enjoy listening you talk to the people\nWant to thank you I appreciate that very much Patrick keep listening and then when the guys get back you might want to consider that also a you clarified it and you're on the other side and the you you express yourself very well and we're not going to agree\nUh bought the there should be more people liking a let's go to a\nGary in a coma Kansas scary you're on with mark\nHey mark Thanks Michael yeah my one is about the illegal border crossings separation of\nParents and the children and the ... my aunt is it it doesn't matter whether you're an illegal alien or the United states\nYou break the law if I'm selling crack cocaine in Kansas City or or um all Manafort or I'm an illegal alien cross order I Am not checking my wife and kids to the oldies so what I Am going to be separated from my kids and I I'm just tired of hearing about this they broke the law\nIf you break the law you're going to be detained and separated from your family kids that's just as simple as that I don't know what the argument that is\nYeah I never understood you know why this wasn't front and center a they'd say well my kids are being separated from me and all the people the bleeding hearts saying how could you tear way that gives them the parents\nDon't bring the kids in the first place it seems so obvious to me that it was the mother was bringing them at or very few fathers I think in someone pointed out even now what do you call them the coyotes were bringing them right and others were bred maybe terrorists who knows what\nA don't tell them you know it was barely mentioned\nYou don't want your kids separated don't cut my hair\nAll this do break the law if you break the law and get thrown into jail you're going to be separated from your family even if you're a set of the United states or\nThe course of the matter if you're not going to affect your kids and stuff to jail with such a factor really ugly you get arrested or jail you're not take your kids to do it it's just retarded there it's just a ridiculous argument so I've got to get back we're like\nOh yeah yeah well you must be a conservative you're working on I'm just kidding all your liberals Democrats out there right I forgot that oh the great points I did say it in the past but I haven't set up this week\nAnybody who goes to trial and gets convicting you get to stay with your kids get to stay with your family planning wife feel\nSo often that I'm living on another planet but that those are the arguments one why'd you bring the kids here we do in the first place except you were hoping to get a package deal where you both get in right that's what you're up to I don't even blame I Do not I can make this point clear\nI Do not pulling illegal immigrants coming to this country to try to seek a better life I Would do the same\nI blame the government and the people on the on the left the particular maybe some liberals to for saying they should be here without following our laws as he made a very good point but who else and get separated from their kids\nWhen you commit a crime and ... and coming here legally is crossing the border is not without documents that you're a legal does nothing to discuss\nSo you're whenever anybody ... commits a crime that happens sometimes things seem so obvious and you wonder why someone isn't making your point of view I'm just repeating myself like Geraldo Rivera and the rest of them saying\nIllegals commit fewer crimes percentage wise I Know what if they weren't here they want to come in at one crime what are you saying they don't believe here belong here and if they committed murder which is the worst thing you can do it wouldn't happen if we didn't allow you and I don't care about the percentages and I didn't even think you're right\nI'm telling ya I live on another planet you tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye\nThat's eight six six nine o seven thirty
