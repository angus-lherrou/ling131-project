the country are you living and you're not saying\nThat at least I'm not saying that the immigrants Cancun can agree immigration has been a boon to the United states overall was an orderly process to make sure you know just make sure you know terrorists how 'bout that wants to make sure that share some of our values or maybe you speak the language you mean that that's so outrageous\nThat you want those things and we're called names on an island or whatever else they call it came to me because we just want some some procedures and we want people to follow that are evil yeah\nYeah but I think at the end of the day the market it gets a winning issue like ... we stick to our guns all back down don't you know don't cave to the pressures last I think it ... it absolutely one hundred percent of the winning argument\nLaw and order and stab washed principles are on our side and I don't see the American public shame you know we want to turn our back on that\nYou know all of a sudden after two hundred and fifty years or you know whatever I ... I Would see this you know process you know we want to turn the country over to a bunch of radicals who are worth a mob mentality\nAbsolutely well I I great called Bruce I agree with you and you made a lot of great points and we need to protect our country you're absolutely right and I I as I said thanks for calling\nHer picture you too and let's go to AJ in Chicago AJ you're on with mark\nHey what's up man I'm I just want to say that actually the last caller had a lot of great points um [noise] I think the biggest problem that he had was that a\nLot of illegal immigrants coming to see the United states uh believing that they have little right just or landing on ah this country um\nI think that you know it's a lot more than just be your it's more of contributing\nIf you don't contribute your community\nThe lowest sense or you don't you're not valuable in that sense so if you don't give a tribute to your country I think that's the highest sense which is what our military\nAnd most of our people who serve this country at the highest level can say\nThat they do um it's nothing they immigrate came calling um so I Would say that I as a ... you should feel that um you come into this country to contribute to the absolute smokes\nOr if you don't think you can do that and I don't know what your contribution to this country is I'm\nJust being here it's not enough to know what I mean\nYeah I Do in fact I think you're I think that's something many of them come here and they wind up with an entitlement mentality right\nThey're entitled to serve as the hospitals schools whatever you want to say and and that you know what here's another great point what you give away for free I called the great point 'cause it's my\nWhat'd you get away for free is usually not value\nWhat you do you give free schools and they don't value the school you get free medical care that after a while people think it's coming to them so we even hurting them the the illegals because we're not making them value what we're giving them\nRight right so I think I have one final point you might find the point is that uh if if you take away a or given for free then what do you ... you know and if you come here with nothing and they expect the most um\nYou really can't deal with things so you should take at least a ... in my in my expectations of what I can give and what I can take it always has to do with what my contributions are at a comedy and I gave\nThe least then I Will be doing the worst if I come here and give most I Will be doing the best there or are you planning to anything whether it's a job\nWhether it's a service position whether it's anything at all or giving your your ... percent or what should\nShould dictate and ... percent a tape that\nIf you gave your absolute least zero percent you're not going to get anything out of it so\nI Do not Europe you reminded me of ... or if I could sure yeah let me ask you remind me of the story if I could share with you when I was teaching younger kids in elementary school when I first started out now I teach adults you know what the kids would do with the free lunch you have any idea what they would do that\nThey would throw in who they would take the bridge they would take the green peas and toss them all over the cafeteria because they got it for free and they place no value on it\nSo in any sense yeah in in a funny sense\nEven with the illegals they may not only is an entitlement mentality but we're not even helping then because they didn't earn any if this were just in the in a way for nothing that and then we're surprised when they don't even value being in America and they don't share you stake in the community and\nGive it a values in fact we've made it so easy that there are now communities where people don't even learn to speak English because everything's done for them in Spanish and I love Hispanic people yeah they're they're mostly in my classes that's not the issue so we've actually in a funny way\nDone harm to them and the other gentleman the other caller said we you know we should not abandon the fight yeah but you do need someone to express it in a way that the American people it is a winning issue and that's what he said\nThat the American people can sign onto it we're not even helping the illegals yeah you say in the short run they're getting free benefits and stuff not in the long run\nNot in the long run do they value what's so special about being in the United states of America and there are set America One caller challenge me on that recall thanks so much AJ\nAnd you haven't even in my grave scare you too thank you\nThank you very much this hour has brought to by freight line or run smart helping run more efficiently is free liners number one goal in mind

hit a while ago is talking about a century city in ... states and about the people voting for them\nAnd I just wanted to live I live here where we vote on that certainly not ever brand name in the whole state of sanctuary space which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually\nVoted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary cities out here and I you know the ones\nYou know it wasn't so they ... on it it's just the Democrats in office a very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat as an office and he just decided that's a good idea and does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now partly\nWhat it is well I was there a few months ago and I'm used to it was amazed when I was walking the streets with\nMy kids are someone yelled at us now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something ... someone says something about a night that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over certain sections I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the\nAnd the homelessness is a problem but that's true you as you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh I I live in San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean\nIt's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's\nIt's it's it's the only thing we voted on and I like to ask you one other thing I didn't mention this fellow I spoke with first but but you have you heard the thing about the the um um birth tourism it was on our throats when it gets yeah mentioned this just a few people and they have not heard of it\nAnd it actually was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty dateline or one of those where they fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant and they have this place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws source we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then they're they have all the right\nThings wrong and of course is wrong and an awful lot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that to me that the politicians here and they well I mean there are people that work for them and they had heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to say it on national radio so people can know what's going on\nIt's we're very close to the border here so it's I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I came down from I mean they have them and I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world\nDo that not just somebody had a baby in Italy I said to the baby out deals citizenship and they said no because he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why were handed out citizenship like if I can do it you know it's it's it's a paradigm they're actually in the ... yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a there are with the with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law and for every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was a one time a solution every problem was the one time\nA solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing if I Lived in a say in Asia and the thing I could get my kid to have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so\nThat I have the baby yeah of course they could go wrong if maybe late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of your dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud

related to that age six six Ninety red eye and I have a question for him and uh\nYou know I think you have a feeling it's going to know my friend my friend is Bruce ... years ago even before he ran for the Senate he proposed that we should do our taxes we should be able to do it on a postcard and yeah I think you find them across name was flat tax how do you feel about that just one flat tax and you do it on a postcard\nWell before I moved to the United states I Lived in Massachusetts and that's where I grew up we have in Massachusetts a flat rate income tax but five and a quarter percent or it's in the constitution a number of states have flat rate\nIllinois that's a nice states have the flat ribs Iraq\nAnd uh what we find is if you are at a flat rate people think it's fair and they don't want to move away from it\nOr I was always told as a kid everybody agrees whichever progressive graduated income tax or some people pay ten percent two percent you know state taxes a federal taxes you know go to tend to almost forty percent [noise] uh\nIf you tax everyone at the same way it keeps the tax rates low for everybody in Massachusetts\nFive times the Democrats liberals have said let's go to a graduated tax will you know divide people into ... and there's a very sophisticated discussion that went on a talk radio because it was a ... year one they'll raise taxes\nCandidate gets year to the way or the Kennedy kids without your on your own soccer because I've already had my rights raised and now it's your turn and they would over time\nThis one at a time and everyone's rights would end up higher and I think that is exactly what has happened\nIn in American history and other countries show the best way to keep taxes low step one single rate spot and then when the government says I've got a great idea and you're all going to pay for it\nAnd people said you know what now what all listening tell us about this great idea where he's both a Obama President Obama and President Clinton got elected promising I Will never raise your taxes now I'm only going to raise taxes on down the top one to two percent said a\nPunch in one percent said Obama of course within the first year they raise gasoline taxes on\nEveryone [noise] ah so the promises that somebody else has got to pay the taxes doesn't really last show the safest thing to do is to have a single rate to taxes people one time that one way it is the toughest tax to raise [noise]\nI was thinking of another one of his ideas he ... he said that if this idea that they take it out slowly prevents revolution someone how to write a check for five thousand dollars of the end of the year or whatever it is really deal with their tank being up or do you agree with that assessment\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper in my freshman year at Harvard and they like flunk me that they said you know does that come from a conversation I had with the IRS I called the phone\nAnd said if they did if he didn't withhold taxes out and everyone's paycheck every\nTwo weeks that looks dead once a month we said send the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send a check for the whole year and the ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the in the paper ours right he said there'd be a revolution if\nThere were I think if someone ... how to ride you know check five
