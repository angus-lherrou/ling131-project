Westwood One radio network James ... from\nA Newsmax here to chat but that's about Taylor Swift James how are you\nA fantastic so it's great to be with you how are you\nI'm doing very well so Taylor Swift trying to get everybody to register to vote she's not even registered to vote isn't that amazing [laughter]\nWell if you try to make\nThat you know a human thing is about Taylor Swift you know a lot of people in the industry or really praising hurt because back in twenty twelve she did this interview with time magazine as you said you know I'm not going to talk about politics I don't want to input\nAnd some people on politics essentially saying that she's an entertainer um and you know that's the maximum that's been in the entertainment business was Samuel Goldwyn told a group of filmmakers if you want to send a message you use a Western Union\nAnd so it's\nBeen because of the century you know if you're in business and you're selling a product it's not a good idea to take positions on controversial issues I mean the NFL has learned that\nUm Hollywood awards shows apparently have and they continue to learn that and Taylor Swift it was not smart of her to do this but she was receiving incredible pressure\nMean it's ... in the world of celebrities you know Ninety nine point nine percent of them lean Alaska and support the left leaning causes and so all of her entourage your friends the people in the industry or pressuring her and the media was relentless\nAs a matter of fact I'm the guardian had a piece\nThat actually said that the cars Taylor Swift towards silent didn't because she has so much influence because she's a this amazing pop star with all these followers on social media her silence means she's still supporter of President Trump\nNo then [laughter] that's how they all around [laughter] well\nThat's one of them and then the even more extreme there were some outlets that claimed that Taylor Swift was sending messages to white supremacist so grave with her imagery and her music videos particularly the one\nLook what you made me do you know because it has the leather and whatever and there are some white supremacist groups that really liked Taylor Swift but you know they just fall into the large fan base that she has but there was one particular\nOutlet that that claimed that she refused to condemn the alt right in the white supremacists\nAnd it bother Taylor Swift to the point where she hired a lawyer to send out a cease and desist letter ah she was probably surprised to find\nThat the ACLU came not to her rescue but to the rescue of those accusing her so I think all of this the cumulative effect of that pressure\nTo her and of course she's going to go left but it shows you know it's funny you you bring up the fact that she's not registered to vote which is laughable\nBut the other thing is she sets forth these clauses that are important to her and one of them as the me too movement feminism because she's a symbol of it because she was involved in a high profile\nGroped gate kind of case\nBut she endorsed bread are saying that guy who hit at least publicly claimed to be supporting Kavanaugh to be supporting President Trump a different to support the cabin on nomination therefore disbelieving\nThe whole the doctor for it and so\nI don't think and then of course Taylor Swift slammed candidate GOP candidate Marsha Blackburn someone who championed legislation that helps people like Taylor Swift collect money for streaming music\nLow ratings you know the lowest in history they beat even last year the lowest in history ratings and even though the only political content was really tailor the strongest\nWhen she said we've got to go out and vote in the midterms well that was within the context in backdrop of her endorsing the Democrats and so the audience so they they were just given a resounding chairs but meanwhile people had shut off the team\nThat's right now is watching I got two words for our names Dixie Chicks\nAnd you know maybe maybe she should learn from it I Know it's not the same audience specific goes there was a country on his guardians mainly but I mean\nIt's you know look it's it's fine I mean I got some friends in the entertainment business or on the conservative side and they don't mind living that be known but uh you you always take a calculated risk and you've got to know your audience if your audience is conservative or is your audience is liberal and maybe she's done the focus groups I have no idea\nBut she's willing to take that chance we'll just see where the chips fall and hurricane well I think\nShe she knows she's at such a high a tax you know she has a hundred and twelve million followers on Instagram she could befall\nPretty precipitous way and still be a superstar and maybe she wants to the movies like Lady Gaga you know I'm so you never know and you know people typically the people who are conservative in Hollywood\nOr people who have established themselves for such a long period of time that they don't care anymore and they're like Clint Eastwood John boy Patricia heat and Gary ... in east there they are kind of his senior

started this is not we're not going to put abortion on trial that's the whole point the point will feel what's the point of the movie\nThe point is that an abortion doctor because of political correctness and abortion doctor who's murdering people can hide behind being an abortion doctor and get away literally wouldn't murder of dozens of people\nDozens of people this is about a guy who burst babies and then killed them and I don't think anybody out there and the pro choice world except for a few of the extreme nut cases can think\nThat's okay but that's what they got the guy for now this is not a gruesome movie they don't show gruesome stuff or they they that this is about the trial of Kermit guys now and how they mailed them on all this\nBut what is so scary is\nThey almost didn't get him and you'll see how they happened to [noise]\nThey happened to bust him on something else that was totally unrelated to the murder charges and then when when they went to searches abortion clinic for evidence on what they were busting enforced when they found all this\nAnd the question that's out there that they don't even ask this but it's Bob the obvious question how many other places around the country is this happening where because of political correctness nobody is keeping an eye on abortion clinics who knows how many other Kermit God's nails are out there\nI have no idea I have no idea but they say legal abortion is vilified by the pro life cause no movie which inadvertently shows that ... of a post role America\nIt does is it an awful\nSays after four and a half years of fundraising filming and distribution guys Nell the trial of America's biggest serial killer has finally landed in a limited number of theatres the title of the conservative back drama does each one of the story of Dr Kermit God no a Philadelphia physician physician\nNow serving three life sentences though is likely confusing for most true crime aficionados that's because in the film and in real life guys now was tried on eight charges of murder and convicted on three that's a large number to be sure\nBut a small fraction in comparison to say Gary Ridgway pleaded guilty to forty eight counts of murder John Wayne gain the convicted of thirty three murders Ted Bundy confessed to twenty eight murders and was convicted of two and Jeffrey Dahmer confess to Seventeen murders and was convicted on Fifteen will feel what do you say about that\nBecause the people this guy killed he disposed of\nThem they could never prove who they were where you could never prove all they got 'em on three and a manslaughter charge on a fourth but that's all they can pin on them they knew\nThere were dozens of them he had been doing this for years for years that was the whole point but they want to act like all well this is this is just their vilify and legal abortion and this is what's happening on that they're free to death of this movie\nCause for some reason they don't even want to go down the road of publicizing\nA a a serial killer if he happens to be an abortion is which is just weird to me if this guy were gynecologist if this guy were if this guy were plastic surgeon and

I'm worried about the left wing media and these crazy mobs out there where they might do\nLo and behold I hadn't seen this story and I swear to you I had and we had Brian kill meat on yesterday did you know that there's been some a couple of comedians that have been following them around and heckling him and I didn't I didn't I didn't see that story tilted day it was weird 'cause I'm going well that's probably what this is all about\nAll of these folks that are getting ambushed by the left\nAnd they're taking folks out I'm sure it's um has something to do with that I don't think that the

you know they they don't want to know something about that but I I think all these gun mounted wherever they may be they may be right wing lunatics\nThey may not be they actually made me laugh when

my\nIn New\nHaven land and\nPlant\nMan\n\n... in vale Nashville\nAnd ah we clearly in the movie we make that distinction but left it's always a lot of good points because I Can't tell the truth so that is true\nIt's to be back now you know I don't want to oversell uh what we're expecting tonight at the box office in Saturday and on the weekend\nBut I think it's going to be more than you think and I know what's going to be more do you think of the Nashville area because we've had a lot of people that have you know the preview that so when you have a preview like that and that and it's um that goes over so well those people become disciples and they go out which is the whole point of doing it\nThey go out and spread the word and we had a packed house here in Nashville a real new Thursday a week ago\nYeah we sure did it was a great audience and a great screening and you know ... that's been the reports that I've gotten early on today is that the movie's doing very well I've gotten a lot of course this is all just anecdotal but people just tweeting me and saying call house today and Indiana full house today in Chicago that kinda thing so\nHopefully uh hopefully a lot of people are getting the word and are making it to the theater\nYeah well it really is it's it's it's an emotional film obviously a but it's an impact fulfillment it's something you know one of the really interesting thing about it is a lot of people are going to see this movie and have never heard this story before but Kermit gods now which is just unbelievable isn't it\nYeah I mean it's it's definitely a harder subject for people to look at but part of the reason I wanted to do the movie\nWas not so much even to make a political argument I wanted to the movie in such a way that we could share the information that most people don't have about what an abortion actually is how it's done and to share it in a way that can be palatable\nBecause it's just it's very hard to look at but you know it's one of those things if you're going to have an opinion on this you need to know what we're talking about and that's what I Hope that movie does\nYeah and again it's not graphic ... there's nothing that you're going to be a little is grows is just not bad at all or but it is it is about the arrest trial of karma guns now who hid behind being a a an abortion doctor to commit some of the most atrocious murders he was convicted of three\nA first degree murder charges but you know we know there were more a lot more\nAnd that's why the subtitle is um you know the trial of America's biggest serial killer\nSo it opens this weekend and uh and how many theaters the you know\nI Believe it's over six hundred something like six hundred and fifty theaters um and hopefully a we have a really good weekend it'll go to more theaters after that\nYeah that's normally what happens in\nYeah [noise] yeah so if we it it's very important for everybody to go this weekend if you can and let's get those numbers up so that the movie can do well because I really do think it's an important movie and the people on both sides of the issue can benefit from it\nAnd he didn't like and they'll see you in and try to make a movie that I I'm I'm Sorry\nI said no see you went in to I Want to emphasize that gives you a fantastic job and the thing I'm telling you\nWell thank you ... it was such a relief to act you know in a while I was directing it that I sometimes I forget that I'm In it [laughter]\nYeah I was I was asking Nick you know when you're acting in that scene who says cut you know so it gets his line I'm tie that government so I guess you haven't yet is the director right\nYeah but sometimes I Would say that you know start over whatever [laughter] yeah I had a lot of great a director a photographer a director of photography named mark Peterson\nAnd I've worked together reports and really trust them I could just got through my take I'd go was that good and you go yeah like okay then cut\nOr he did he say no I'm the director I say cut cut\nAnd you know they say that I did say caught on my own\nThing [laughter] well you you folks have to see this 'cause it is a marvelous are marvelously may movie and the message is just going to blow you away it's not really it's something you folks couldn't when she's in the ... movie but it's it's ... I've I've I'm\nTold people it's like a souped up version of law and order I mean it's just it is a it's an intriguing story about going after this guy and the evidence so if you like those kinds of things CSI law and order and these guys are the types of uh or if you like Grisham novels\nIt's sort of one of those things it's a lot of it takes place in the courtroom\nAnd then what surrounding you

you know people people should know it's a thriller it works as a crime drama but it's also entertaining they're actually some laps in the movie too\nI Know that was just something as yeah me too and be seen as a man that's the job\nHere and the guy who plays guys now Earl Billings I mean he is remarkable it's a great performance really is\nI Know and he does he really does a good job I've seen that guy in some stuff too because he look they look quite familiar but he uh he's\nBeen yeah he's been around for years and years\nAnd he does an eerie job has gotten cause gum now was one of those I mean I guess still just said this guy doesn't think he did anything wrong does he\nKnow that absolutely convinced that he was performing a service and that that that what he was dealing with no different than anyone else I'm\nThink keeping victimized by the anti abortion crowd you know he doesn't he doesn't believe in the distinction between what he did and legal abortion\nYeah like when ... when the babies crying and then you kill it that's okay too you know it's just unbelievable yeah well Nick Searcy is in this thing is one of the stars is also the director of God's now opens

use that in and like I gave him credit too because you know there are they got websites and what have you\nWere ones that I was was that in I think it was Prague or what and I came across the guy that

of this play off the phone I think uh sometimes you know there's something lost in translation\n[noise]\n\n\nWell you know are the people upset about it because far be it from us to assume that everybody wants to live in a republic like we do so I can see both sides of this\nBut will this not open our eyes to the fact that most of the hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis alone\nI don't know how that happens without the Saudi Government being involved in it and of course we've heard the stories about the Saudi royal family they some of them\nThere were here in the United states that were given safe passage by the Bush administration right after nine eleven and some right before it so I mean I don't want to end of the conspiracy theories but\nSaudi Arabia has not been a good actor and they're also part of OPEC for crying out loud this jerk and are chain on the gas prices I don't know why we cow town to these folks but apparently this may be the end of that if Trump as we've been to say about it so we'll see how it ends up\nBut it takes killing a Washington Post columnist so we don't want to look into the fact that Saudi may have been the Saudis may have been behind nine eleven

a heck of an artist I'm Talking about drawing really yeah he used to do caricatures of us I've still got one of his that he did a caricature of the whole staff\nOr including me and him in the morning guy in the news person and all that and it was just it was really I mean he's really talented guy but that's what I was doing in Seventy nine\nI Wish you know you're talking about artist I really I Wish I knew ... more people in that business ... in that are in that group\nBecause my wife is just talented but I don't know how to al ... as far as being an artist yeah or ... but she is fabulous absolute dry and she's made a bad thing about it is that or you know nothing against her dad but he has not not be supportive well no I mean ... and he's really kind of killed her\nHer confidence in that area you know well she doesn't listen now that's why I told her and and so I'm hoping I can introduce or to some people that may be ... does she do this you'd like to paint or does she like the ... all of it she paints draws she does I Need to bring in\nThis a wood burning thing she did for her dad it's up to do an a and um\nBut beyond a female dean yeah as a female there and ... and it's young going you know ... or ... she didn't bring yeah and the detail is unbelievable I mean it it's odd to bring it in such an image you being Indian as she is yeah I mean she could really capitalize Ho Chi but I'm not saying that explored it but I'm just saying you know she\nShe's an Indian art is how do really able would dig that they really would and she just she not only is anymore she looks Indian and she's fun to be around and I've never been around a more fun all she's a hoot she really she's country but that's why as you go to our country you know she's very [laughter] you know from her part of it I\nYou know everybody in the south says y'all mhm but from ... part of the country it's un I knew in you and that's it and and I I I you know when she moved here I like\nYou may want to drop the U.S [laughter] and you and it makes you really\nWell I got a friend who's um he's married to an uh an Indian lady and I mean she'll\nShe'll break into doing all that stuff and she's from way out in\nThe sticks and the hurricane mark first met her he's uh\nShe said uh you watch they suffer and he says a shoe or\nShe said we're having neck Mona noodles [laughter] and and mark and said uh I've never I don't believe I've ever had that and you're trying to be polite that shit I ain't never known them money and then the next ... noodles and so [laughter]\nAnd so mark Kay belief somebody never had an ... noodles so um yeah I mean that's the way out in the sticks up right where it is that your wife will get hooked up with somebody that can help or promote her stuff\nShe needed to change that because that's what I told her I said you need to get out of their father tries to keep her in you know there'll be a greeter at\nWal Mart or no no no no no no no he's an artist what she needs to do and this is my advice to where she needs to put some of this stuff just take pictures of it and get her ... ... page or something put it on and see if somebody buys all she's got the she puts it on the and she's and she's ships it out\nSanta very lucky ... our music ground gosh I just love it because she she painted Hendricks he really he's in there um she also painted this train\nAt the like a rock and roll train on the other side that novel I write flips out over that and then uh she has the old way one\nAlbum cover that she painted one on one that because that will say she needs to be doing this and that album was out when I first moved here ...\nTo Nashville that's why I Am ... shot and then we'll promote it on the radio and hurting people do it I'll put a link to uh to fill Valentine dot com and we'll get some business she too good just to be staying at home doing these wasting our time yes she is well this is something that I've talked about all the time with folks and\nYou know I have managed to swindle my way through this life on ... mediocre talent and ah [laughter]\nThat's precisely why are your brother and and it's\nJust if you know I have made it through on goal you know I have no shortage of goal\nAnd something else as I have no shortage of a I guess goal and gumption are very similar\nBut I don't mind failing and it doesn't faze me one bit when somebody says oh you suck you know go okay well I'll come back and show you so ah what I what I lack in talent I make up and and goal\nBut she's got talent and no goal she needs to have some golf so she needs if she's not going to have a goal and this is a problem with some artist out there\nThey need some that's why you have those sleazy agents you\nKnow it's right [laughter] that's where they come in because they don't care they'll pass through the hell out of everybody and they don't have any friends anyway so you know they just go out there [noise] they just they but they got money you know they got money and they passed the heck out of everybody and get them to come you know to to the\nUh whether it's the art show or whether it's a a show show\n... or whatever the case may be and they just make a dent in general nuisance of themselves but they uh they get the artist exposed and that's where they said that their talent you know their talent is bugging the hell out of you and so you you need somebody like men\nThat are ... and then once you do what you made any ... and they will be the goal will listen and then she'll run off with that guy ... million of knowing my history oh yeah [laughter] well yeah you didn't have an effect now\nOn the big stuff folks we got several cranes a left wing people out there that are attacking and they're mostly pro life activists are there are several stories you can check by the way the guy who kicked the pro life woman\nYou remember when we have that and then we showed the video that got all that just made my blood boil I wanted somebody to hold and I wanted to hold him down and beat the crap out of him but he's been arrested and he struck by the way that wasn't the first time he's vandalized stuff and they got him doing it on several occasions so he may be going to jail for a while\nI Hope so uh but we also have this thing with the Turks saying that the Saudis killed this Washington Post columnist and I'm sitting here looking at a National Review story today the desert seeing them keeps turning the United states government and the wires they're talking about the ... mall cash Yogi\nA well known Saudi political activist and journalist last week he went into the Saudi conflict in in its than bullets in Turkey\nTo get a document for an upcoming marriage and then he disappeared\nTurkish authorities are searching for the Saudi hit squad they believe murdered him and then this remembered him whatever bar beret the is at work they say it's now becoming another special moment in the very special relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nWe can add it to the other special moments where the president ... golden orbit were America's ... columnists praised Mohammed bin Solomon\nAs a great reformer and when the U.S assisted the Saudis in creating the worst cholera outbreak in modern times when asked whether he might retaliate and stop a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with the kingdom President Trump says\nI don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's being poured into our country why the jobs but now Trump is saying today he's taking a serious look at this he says we may have to rethink our relationship with these people\nThey say the truth is that Trump is doing the selling job on themselves the hundred and ten billion dollar figure is more like a menu of deals he offered the Saudis not a done deal\nThe Saudis have purchased the terminal high altitude area defense anti ballistic missile system for about Fifteen billion that's be\nAnd the state department has announced four billion dollars another completed an improved arms sales the Saudis didn't complete every arms deal the President Obama offered them either\nOne can understand that the practice of geopolitics means that you don't always get to choose your allies\nAnd the super power cannot conduct business my dealing only with nations like Switzerland and Lichtenstein so we're gonna have to deal with some bad actors out there and they of course to the point is made\nThat when you deal with some of these folks then you have more chance to influence them I think a lot of times that's a cop out\nIt depends on what they're doing for instance I think we have no business dealing with China\nNo business whatsoever but of course the market is so huge that we can't ignore it and we want to ignore it and so we're going to deal with China because of the money so it's not about doing the right thing\nIt's about uh doing the prudent thing and the same thing happens with Saudi Arabia now I don't believe that they mentioned in his speech from National Review it's called Saudi Arabia is still a lousy friend I don't think they mentioned the fact that\nTo eight oh eat he ate up
