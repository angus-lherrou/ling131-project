I can guarantee you whatever given Sunday but no seriously I Know I\nMean I I look at a number of things my dad was a\nCareer military police officer and\nThat was honestly I think I was driven to do that or for a long long time and it was my dad actually who kind of laid out you know okay this is how this will go\nIf you're successful at it you know and and a number of things and he said if you want to do this and you know he got his masters degree um and he is\nA you know he was in his day\nOr a top military cop right so when he laid it out to me before coming to this job\nBut I was you know by was testing and everything and\nThat's what that's where I was going and you know he told me this is the reality and you have to be prepared for the reality because it's even different between the the the the setting in the military which if you are on a base is very secure the differences as\nThey pointed out and uh the Tom Cruise movie\nOr a Jack Jack reaches act redress or if it's a murder all of the suspects are potentially are trained killers [laughter]\nRight [laughter] that's a little bit different that was a great line that right yeah but the but I mean so my dad was kind of pointing out that you know a number of things that that considered to consider and I came to this job\nUm and shortly after and uh they just kept coming to work and I'll quote another movie\nRichard Gere an officer and a gentleman like nowhere else to go hand and no one is here in a in a in a couple of months at this job and and I love doing this giant to me that that's always Wayne's World yeah what oh yeah\nWe ... our our our ... like a girl I'm as Chris Farley\nBut you know that was what was satisfying\nAbout this job as we get to a you know in foreign people\nAre when there is breaking news and and and storms like this or we have experts ready and we can we can warn people in in foreign people\nAnd I say I think it ... and then of course the political discussions and that information I think is also key we've heard from a number of people over the years that talked about how you know they they've listened and\nAh they have become I guess more thoughtful in there and their political views\nAnd I think that's a good thing that's all yeah that that's that's the left ... starts moving toward violence and and shouting and and what was it that Eric Holder or said if you know if they go oh you're in a low well you know kick them yeah right and and\nYou know when they when that happens again I don't know what it at at what point they\nCome back if they ever do to a civil discussion Hillary saying recently that it's the other days well when we when will return to a civil discussion that's basically her message and her statement\nI I think those with the debate or with the the skills to debate and the knowledge of the ideas on which this country was founded are always going to win\nWhen they go low we kick 'em you know when you were talking about it though what when when you know what things that might interest you and uh this though when you talked about you know radio and I knew this when I was I don't know seven eight years old I knew I wanted to be on the radio ... that was\nDominant nothing else really entered my mind\nA bit like I said for years it's what I wanted to do I never thought I'd end up doing talk radio mhm thank God I did because I I couldn't sit and talk about a star is born\nAnd Lady Gaga has wonderful performance every day and and abide by the way I haven't seen the movie so I've no idea what this wonderful or not I'm just I'm I'm assuming that if I'm working for music station I Would have to do that [laughter] what a wonderful performance in the music was just wonderful not that look talking entertainment and we'll talk about entertainment once in a while but to do that every single day\nAnd had it has to be positive about what comes out of Bollywood and do that every single day would everybody knows that would kill me to be able to do this\nAnd articulate ideas and and uh there's there's two things first off the people to call you and say thanks so much because I've learned a lot that's that's a wonderful thing to have a wonderful thing the other wonderful thing and people are saying might think well you can't really me that I Do\nIs when people call you with extreme passion of how they disagree with you mhm\nBecause I'm always amazed well\nThey really care what I think [laughter] yeah I really I I always get that really ... somebody's really ticked off me for something I said you're you're getting really out then that's interesting and so I said to me that and I know it's going to happen but you know when we talk about\nThe Democrats and the whole instability thing I Will tell you this\nWhen I'm dirt during the campaign because of the way that you and I you know we've always done shows we don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat\nNo and you know we're we're conservative you know slashed libertarian I have a lot of liberal friends right and and and I don't know if they call me friend any more of a well we but we don't we don't care that the politicians that we analyze we don't care what your label is if we're agree with you we will if we don't we don't\nA lot of people are bothered by that ... even on the Republican side had been bothered over the years and not starting with Trump when we disagreed with him we respectfully disagree with a\nA ... when I first got to talk radio George Herbert Walker Bush ... read my lips no new taxes [laughter] so it goes all the way back\nThere with a with W we disagreed with a lot and and uh I'm with a a Trump a few things not ... you know and but the things that we disagree with Trump I Will say our core to our belief\nAs as conservative and free market or you know a a people when it comes to economic things are and so we may be passionate about it but the vast majority of what Trump does you know I ... what he actually does substance wise and the legislation that he puts forward\nAnd the executive orders that that he puts forward when you actually read into it on his foreign policy\nOr I've been one hundred percent uh agreement with but ah you know to be able to do that to be able to go on and just have you know the freedom of creativity oh I Know the point I wanted to make that\nAs it seems that everything is getting an civil law out there mhm and things are going crazy I don't know what it is but it's like\nAnd I know would you agree with me we've never had this discussion\nSeems like I'm getting less flak yeah because I'm not really getting there are no I mean I there was more an anger a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago or you know from the response that we you know the ... that I Would get from the things that I Would say ... very few and far between now\nWell and and I think the uh while the tactics clearly have changed and when the tactics change and they go the direct route as they call it\nAnd they became they become a ... it's it's beyond a protester it's someone who is going to be in your face\nAnd when that happens they don't have because why do they go there\nBecause they don't have a debate anymore they don't want to have a debate I'm not saying this is the case where everyone on the left in fact I think there are plenty plenty of Democrats out there right now that can't stand what's going on on the left and can't stand a\nFirst of all had no need for Hillary Clinton or or if they did and they look at what she said just a couple of days ago highly disagree with that kind of tactic and won't use it but the problem is is that\nThat squeaky crybaby whining wheel\nIs always going to get the grease\nAnd that's where the cameras are that's where the social media is\nI I I look at it and I think to myself that the reason and Benin talk radio twenty nine years and I believe right now for as insane as it seems to be out there I Know the flack that I get is extremely light\nI think probably people have taken it to social media but I really believe that the point is is not that are that are arguments had changed any or had become stronger we may ... and I think it should be called talk show host you learn\nHow to debate better\nVisit to stop text outbreak started work brought you in the national Highway Traffic Safety

a category three hurricane or a storm has not hit\nA Georgia this strong sense Eighteen Ninety eight and those types of things just just down here with us when you begin looking at you know the uh fourth strongest on record\nTo ever hit the U.S about just under a cat category five at a hundred and fifty seven miles an hour\nWhile a ... in terms of what we're looking at in the coming days here for a not just Georgia but uh the Carolinas what is the threat still from Michael [noise]\n[noise] well we're going to see continued rainfall in areas where they don't need any more rainfall that's for sure we'll see the sister moved through southern Georgia or most of South Carolina and the low country of North Carolina where the ground is already saturated the trees are sitting in mud\nAny amount of wind is going to topple those trees and we could see some additional flooding in those areas I mentioned also tornadoes if you picture a a hurricane coming onshore at a hundred and fifty miles an hour when it hits the land\nIt begins to slow down a little bit because it encounters homes and trees and the ground friction slows the surface movement\nOf the hurricane but as you go aloft a thousand two thousand feet up the system is still advancing pretty rapidly well that sets up a window gradient and when we get a win gradient we get rotation and a potential tornadoes are spawned as a result\n... and of course when you look at the the flooding are often the most deadly part of a storm or that's something that as you mentioned on the ground saturated in the Carolinas but but certainly even in Georgia or with this kind of rainfall flash flooding is is the big threat correct\n[noise] it is a flash flooding and the result of flash flooding I'm aware of one possibly to death

[laughter]\nSo we all know yeah we all know the bias\nSure you know we did [laughter] and\nIt it at least there is somebody you know on MSNBC bet recognize that I Believe they all recognize it and you know this as as we've said many times and and and you had Republicans stating that\nReally with no argument coming back from the Democrats which was\n... you had the process to do this you had the process to interview her you had the process it existed already it's done all the time as Lindsey Graham\nMade known that you could have kept her out of this and done an FBI background check and it probably over that month period done a more\nIntensive background check\nThen you could have even done in a week\nAnd if\nCould have kept her name out of it and then they asked her permission as to whether she wished to go forward with it or wish she wished to say no that's okay and it stays in the private record whatever evidence was gathered as it did already\nAnd it's never brought up again and her name is kept out of it why because everybody knows Scarborough knows\nHis guess them as they're liberals they know because it was never about attempted sexual assault it was never about doing what's best for the alleged victim\n\nIt was about one thing and one thing only using her\nTo make a political statement now is it right and we said this always back a and\nA lot of other media has said the same thing conservative media have said the exact same thing and now you've got MSNBC say the exact same thing I think that that we have said all along\nThat and and it's interesting coming from out of somebody see that they have Grassley had leak that it would have been the number one story yeah again I Would have been that they would sure it will be going after him today day in and day out the questions would never ever stop why\nIs a but my first question is why as a Joe Scarborough are pretending to be on the right again [laughter] and it's something happen at home\nUh [laughter]\nI'm just asking questions I'm just asking why should I like the question but ah if us we're talking about that in the ... Michel ... what's going on there um but he's right on the ... points I'm not sure if he\nActually\nFeel stuck with that [laughter] but he did make the point and you look at the um the dynamics of of how all of this played out and they didn't win so in recent days they become\nA well even crazier and promoting their tactics you have ... who wants to fight the president in a ring he wants to he wants an M I may fight for charity\n\n[noise] then you have the former candidate for the Democrats\nWho says we're not going to be civil we won't be civil again until we went\nAnd and then you have did you see the Hollywood Reporter story mhm on Stephen Miller and one of the president's advisors I\nI I I'm not this is ... we're not making this up this is absolutely true Mm All right we are not because you're going to say you guys are making the supper remember we had the call from the one Democrat who was just furious and so this is a light appointment we need to investigate all the way back\nTo the womb right well there on that path\nOf investigating all the way back to the moon and this story from the ... Hollywood Reporter we are not making this up because you you if you haven't heard the story you're gonna think we're making it up there's a headline from the Hollywood Reporter Stephen Miller who's the one of the president's advisors\nSteven Miller's third grade teacher says he was a loner and ate glue\nGod\nIs my witness they have their picture you can see right there yeah there is Stephen Miller with his fellow third graders at Franklin elementary and they have a circle around him\nAnd his third grade class picture you want to hear how the article starts ...\nIn Nineteen Ninety three Donald Trump senior political advisor intend to Santa Monica is frankly momentum ... where he was off by himself all the time\n\n[laughter] do you remember the character and peanuts the one called pig pen and the dust cloud and crumbs flying all around him that was Stephen Miller at eight years of age I was always trying to get him to clean up his desk he always had stuff mashed up in there he was a strange dude I remember he would take a bottle of blue\nAnd we didn't have glue sticks in those days and he would pour the glue on his arm let it dry peel and then eat it off\n[noise] uh I\nWould say the majority of male students at that age we're doing the same thing\n[laughter] I didn't eat it but I did do the thing where you let it dry and peel it off your skin I did that all the time I remember that was the only ... that was the only reason I ever\nHad ... I remember being concerned about I'm not academically he was okay with that though I could never read his handwriting but he had such strange personal habits he was a loner an isolated and off by himself all the time\nSo it was I and I ended up normal oh wait probably not\nThe best defense for Stephen Miller is a no a Stephen Miller responded on Twitter ah when I was young\nI glue sometimes I too much clue I I like glue I still like glue\nNeeded [laughter] no that's the capital I like beer ... Devon alright yeah\nCome on the present okay sorry Stephen Miller responded on Twitter because the headline on Twitter from the Hollywood Reporter or you know as a ... that Stephen Miller as a as a kid was a loner\nAn aide glue his response on Twitter one of these things is true [laughter]\nThat's that's all [laughter] that's hilarious um but ... this but this is where they're going in and this was a report from his teacher now or that they're getting closer to the womb more now to third grade in\n\nWell I think um they should I think they should keep going I Want to know what those infants are up to all of them well what's\nGoing on in their mind I Know what's going on a diaper about what's going on in the mind as a you know as as a fetus\nTrump kicked his mother over and over again it was obviously domestic abuse mhm\nKavanaugh to\nThat's the one guy gentleman called up a couple of weeks ago and ... or ... maybe it was last week called up and said I mean it's a lifelong apartment we need to invest it all the way back to the womb what were the third grade now yeah here we're not to high school yeah well now we've got we and the thing is they skipped junior high and went right to third grade\nI I I'm trying to think what my teachers would say oh man oh crap\nOh I've heard my better never getting involved in politics my former or a a German teacher a little shocking Povich ... is a I mean it still rings in my ear today mhm and by the way I did say this I was doing a radio show didn't know he was on his deathbed and you heard me talking about him\nAnd and this goes back to Ninety three I was talking about him is on his deathbed ... I had no idea and I got a letter from his caretaker like a year later yeah uh but uh he his famous words\nMcNamara stop picking your nose that I had my chemistry teacher in high school said that he would say that you know if you weren't paying attention you would say that it would call you out by saying hey step again well I was even if you weren't I was probably picking my oh sad [laughter] I Can't remember a time when I wasn't\nNo it wasn't gonna pick it up but I wasn't scratch scratch [laughter]\nNo I uh I just think it's so great that that this is what it's but this is what has come to I mean I I Love the fact that it is oh so you have to that that this is the best you've got because think about\nRadio and he is our country and on Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or\nRun I coming

go back to the um uh the the the ball field is shooting of ...\nAnd how that was as we pointed out yesterday a multiple assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast ... by video roadblock\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva

Ninety red eye let's get an update on now\nTropical storm Michael as we turn to meteorologist Tom hello good morning Tom good morning All right so where are we with ah with Michael and what is the the storm in terms of the power of this storm still look like\nWell the power of the storm is still there at about five thousand feet we've got when that are blowing at about eighty miles an hour or they haven't diminished all that much and with thunderstorms those thunderstorm wins the downdraft translate some of that wind so we have higher gosh [noise]\nAnd so for that reason alone at windows still an issue especially when it gets it cross into North Carolina because uh we talked about this for four days in advance as Florence was coming in that they had already had some saturation from a remnant\nOf a tropical storm that pushed its way on through and and of course when\nObviously Florence came through the low lying areas that are run up through a stay at veil and ah south of Raleigh that entire area is still very saturated John trout touched on it and he said trees are sitting in mud and\nThat's exactly what it is we had ... that's the event that we had in the Carolinas with a very slow moving Florence\nAnd as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ... and also there's going to be obviously a good deal more flooding now yes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take much for a little bit of flooding to to\nReef re and develop and [noise] it's west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place\nA toward Raleigh and then back up a a up into Virginia a Lynchburg, Virginia Roanoke, Virginia everything on the eastern side\nOf the mountains there [noise] uh up to Charlotte and or Norfolk that entire area um is gonna see anywhere from a three to as much as eight inches of rain as it gets further on up [noise] um\nAnd there's a you know why not to include here are the folks over Allen the outer banks from okra coke island which is down towards the south end up to duck or they're under a storm surge watch in effect ...\nAnd and how I I guess what is the potential there in terms of that storm surge uh and and what the the height might be\nA four feet okay to demography yeah uh you know it'll inundate some neighborhoods some some areas where it'll come out of the banks um but um it's when you think about it it it just goes to the power of this now tropical storm\nAnd its Winfield yeah right yeah and so that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael has came ashore a a Wednesday afternoon and something that we've touched on yesterday during our program and that is the the because of that power because of that energy\nBehind the storm and it grew after of course uh we got off the air\nUh the it it intensified that that means it's\nA longer lasting a storm so you're expecting Michael to still be a tropical storm a strength in terms of uh the when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah why why so [laughter] yeah well\nBus with the availability of the industry's only sixteen leader engine the Detroit Didi

looks like a that the ... the opening looking at the Dow futures right now will be down you know maybe a couple of hundred points and just start to start the morning we'll start that will start down\nA variety of different things uh it was interesting because I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has written the wall Street Journal said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things\nYou know little signs out there that you and I talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what you know treasury bills we just happened to be talking about that last night right and and we were looking at that at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year\nThat's just in a year it has doubled that you know that means there's more money that the government has to pay out just\nA four in ... she got the fed now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out or did we do this on the air off the air about uh that uh because uh ... what we did it on their mortgages were going up and spend a lot of time on it but a mortgage rates are up over\nFive percent which means uh the price of housing or could be coming down to you know to make up for the the higher rates unless Eric's idea of the one hundred and twenty year mortgage comes along yeah you're\nKidding me I mean if they're doing that for if they're doing the what is it I think you can get a loan for Ninety six months\nWhat is it uh it's it's I Know it's well into the eighty a month cycle or loan for automobiles how's it going to do that then you get the hundred and twenty year mortgage [laughter] well if they did on\nRight away yeah I mean we were talking about the ridiculous um uh the ridiculous uh uh uh products that were on the on the mortgage market um back during the subprime mess and before the of the fall out\nUm but yeah I you look at a number of things Jim Kramer CNBC the ... street that I'm\nTalking about a ... at the end of the day and and for the evening was talking about you know he doesn't like the fact that the the fed a is not looking at the the economic data and reviewing that before they make the announcement about it\nUm but then on the other hand he said you know he likes the fact that his regimented and and deliberate in their rate hikes\nI says they've been kind of you know non uh a regimented they haven't been there hasn't been a real strong pattern to to that I I don't know how much I put on the fed right now are for this eight hundred and thirty\nTwo point drop yesterday a you know there are smarter people than than I can look at it but as you mentioned\nYou look at the reaction to something like that and it was not the the meltdown of years prior because percentage wise it's still not as big as you've seen in the past right and so it it a lot of things going on right now especially in the tech sector I think there's a lot of\nA concern about regulation that's going to cost the tech sector or at least a slow them down in terms of growth\nAnd what they are able to earn because that regulation I Believe is coming and I think there's a lot of concern for the tech sector there\nUm but the economy is chugging along pretty well and when you get a correction like you saw yesterday or it is expected it is not surprising at all to those investors on the floor\nI you know I I think it said they're just there comes a day when you just I I think that many investors just say okay I'm today everything combined makes it so I think I'm going to pull out of this and put it into\nA this because not only was the tech sector head but caterpillar ... ah companies that are involved in international trade in the United states were hit yesterday there's a reason for that\nThere's a reason and the reason is\nStill the possibility of trade wars when you look at it you know so the president said okay we have a NAFTA agreement are okay but everything hasn't been solved here Congress has been awfully quiet a on it or their negotiations going on does Congress\nWant look that just does Congress want NAFTA the new napped or whatever it's called the\nCanada whatever United States and Mexico instead of NAFTA the nations formerly known as snapped at an agency had to face the nations formerly known as North America North American ... uh you know a ... I Wonder if there is pressure inside Congress I guess it's just pure speculation\nBut inside St look if you got to do after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do and we're going to do it let's get everything done\nAnd that's putting pressure on the on on the White House or the fact is yeah you know having ... going to\nAt least stabilize the market with some good and bad as we have gone through and we have gone through a a NAFTA because we do believe\nThat if if the new NAFTA passes [laughter] it'd be trade agreement fully known as NAFTA if it passes it's gonna hurt the auto industry it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now\nInitially when you say it it's something that may not hit the market at that particular point you know at at but when you take everything together the worries about regulation\nIn the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields are going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nOr to to service the the the the dead and the possibility of the trade war with China where there there isn't doesn't seem to be\nAny type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about a steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\n... well you mentioned now or the the terrorists and PG E taking a ten percent hit yesterday a and you know this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and the cost of raw materials and and so as you know there\nAre essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor of of uh of of coding and special materials specialty materials but that is also part of the auto industry so the the the car sales a the automobile sales\nHave are seem to have stalled out for now or what's behind that are certainly you know that the cost of automobiles is going up and ... is directly related\nTo tariffs then there's a greater demand for used cars that when there's a greater demand for any group in terms of products\nThat cost goes up so it is it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once and you go back to All right well how much of this is controlled by either the fed or the federal government and how much of this this cost of government\nAnd right now you could look at ... and I think you could look well at interest rates and ran and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here is related to what government regulation them everything that\nWe just and I didn't even think about that until you just said\nThere and say wow everything is government regulation is so you can actually make the argument that hurt it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we haven't servicing our our debt all of it goes back to\n[laughter] in in some way\nA government a regulation and when we talk about the tech industry\nAnd what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that we said this before and you look when we you know we've gotten into great debates and disagreements with the administration about ah you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new labeled tariff babies\nAre that the president came up with a but the look in the real world you raise prices it hurts when the economy and the story right you can sit there and go rah rah rah usa usa you can have all the chance you want\nBut if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts when the economy and hurts workers and just because you wish to chant or you know just say America First does it mean America is necessarily first by the policy that you put in\nV.

six six Ninety read I well let's now tropical storm Michael but still a very dangerous storm\nAs a now we turn to a meteorologist Tom hale who joined us good morning Tom\nGood morning don't let that fool you right yeah because uh you you you look at the footprint of of a tropical\nStorm Michael now a which has been wreaking havoc on on a Georgia\nAnd headed for the Carolinas and it's it's the satellite photos or just a amazing or just startling and and and this this storm again still has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut yeah the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect in the next report that to decrease\nI Would think so it should drop to probably fifty if that um it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop is reasonable although it\nLooking at it and radar and just kinda clocking it uh I I I don't think it'll do more than ten miles it might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the north east it may be Twenty one miles an hour and I said earlier predicted it would exit the United states at about twenty three twenty five miles an hour [noise]\nUh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia before it exits outta here yeah um yeah it's a uh it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're going to see storm surge from this storm in the Carolinas of two to four feet that's water inundation rice and and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems\nIt's not the biggest one there then it will be another one or not the biggest one it will be feeder bands and we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes\nNow these tornadoes and the feeder bands that feed her bans are coming in from the east and moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeastern northwest and the bans have individual storms at 'em and they're moving out to about forty miles an hour now those individuals storms are capable of brief\nSpin a tornadoes in the individual super Sal soon as we get into the afternoon those storms will be here\nIn the afternoon maximum heat and that's going to happen\nPrimarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to see that the greatest potential for tornado activity but it's a wind and so whether it's a to an addict wind or it's a sustained tropical force winds to forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage\nAnd it's got to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina or what has gone on as Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed that most of them because of the wind has been toppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos right on on\nTelevision mhm so boom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit the power lines\nBingo so we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right okay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that number is low and\nAnd here it already a one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think\nThe next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence between the Carolinas that over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area a thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nAnd they're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas and Georgia and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so you know they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of

I don't think we talked about it on the air\nWas just how from the very beginning it seemed like the the ... what do they call it the tone of uncertainty right that there was a certainty to it that it was almost you look at it from five days ago I mean they had that it that was\nYou look at that that's that's as close as you can get to be in a hundred percent correct and now the speed they didn't know by you know the the strength of the hurricane\nThey didn't know they kept popping up in it and still were you know and and really it was in the last twenty four hours where they said who knows\nThis thing could go but they really had it down as to where you know the words going because it's almost following that exact path that we saw five days ago yeah\nSo uh you know when we talked about the weather guy can't forecast will ride and well and you know and there are things you missing something or like this I mean how do you figure out a storm like this but they did\nI just wonder how they were able to you know how that can be so accurate on the on the path on the path of ... ... to the point of you know daily miles either way if you look at it right I Know they moved it a little bit uh late last night were seemed to go a little bit more\nUh you know eastern but the reality of it it looks like it's right on where the original path was to begin with right yeah yeah [noise] uh but uh uh there's we're on I Will be talking to Tom hale here at the bottom of the hour in um other news and there's a ton of other news out there\nUh the big economic news was the stock market down almost eight hundred and thirty two points eight hundred and thirty one something uh uh yesterday huge shit third biggest point drop in history but it's not the point drop it's really\nThe percentages we all know that ah but still a a shock to some a un I talked about this for a while that you know and will there be a correction and when we're there'll be a correction\nBecause there's a variety of variables that everybody was looking at number one you know the tech stocks or took a hit but they're worried about regulation a you know you'd we've talked about Google we've talked about Amazon or you know Netflix ... next what's an ... Netflix was\nWas down you saw that the companies that were involved in international trade\nOr like caterpillar and other companies are we're down because of trade worries you had the president last night at the rally in Pennsylvania are you know talking about the fed and you know what is the the fed doing that they're raising interest rates\nIs is complain I'm sure as are raising interest rates to quickly but then you have\nA in the the the bond market if you look at you know government bonds and treasury bills or that their interest rates keep going up and up and up and up and\nWe have said when you combine all those together when you combine still the uncertainty of the trade agreements formerly known as NAFTA or if you look at the Chinese tariffs which I an hour in effect\nAnd will hit a now as we enter the uh the the Christmas season we have you know always asked and\n[noise] and for the longest time I I think in a lot of good times we've all off and said\nNo matter whether it's this good time or other good times is the market overvalued [laughter] right well it began with yeah it is the is the optimism too great even when the economy's doing good at times I right right and and so uh we are the experts were not the experts at predicting but\nLooking at what the futures are doing overnight they expect it could be a couple of hundred points\nMaybe even as high as three hundred point a drop or when\nThe market opens this morning interesting that one of the points that are going through a some comments made by Jim Kramer\nA CNBC and the street dot com\nAbout some of the indicators or or some of the signs I guess at the market was looking at one of them being packing materials and you don't think of that on a you know for us lame and we don't we don't look at that but of course\nRight if there is a drop in the in the cost of packing materials that means\nThat there is a demand there was a glut of those materials on the market semi conductors the same thing on the technology side\nBecause of things going on with China\nChina's slowing down a a a terrorist and everything else but their economy and and trying to slowing down as well but the so when demand slows down you know of course in that sector where the price starts to drop\nIn those sectors of those types of materials or we looked at uh the than the ... G A effect they lost ten percent\nOr as a result of and this is a company that's roughly what a hundred and Thirty years old\nUh and they talk about the raw materials and what they do and the and the and the coding zoos and the automotive market and everything else um those raw material costs going up so they lose money and that has to do with a with terrorists and and a number of other things\nBut when there's a glut on the market that's a bad sign because those that the that means that the demand has slowed\nOr when they're when the costs go up especially as a matter of policy that's a bad sign when especially when you don't know how long that's going to be around that or that effect that policy is going to be in place\nA regulation and you and I as we were discussing this last hour the hour before we both with us we're talking about it and went wow okay regulation or that the uh tech companies are are worried about what's that\nOh government policy when we talk about the fed 'em government policy when we talk about the increase\nOr in in a in the interest rate in government bonds that's because of massive borrowing oh again government policy\nWhen we talked about terrorists irrespective of what do you think they're justified or not raising the cost of doing a a a you know business all those regulation increase in interest rates\nAre\nAre terrorists all are doing what increasing the cost of business no matter what when you increase the cost of business the economy will hurt not an opinion that is fact\nYou you know there is that their dad yeah Antarctic and and one of the elements are that the that basically what that was being assessed as the rise of the U.S dollar which is Ah yes I saw you know if you look at that the rise of the u._s. dollar based on what that is a growing often\nIt is the growing economy are and what happens is our trade partners when the dollar starts a two to drop a little bit\nThen they can because of the exchange rates\nIt makes it cheaper for them or to buy from the U.S okay so they go shopping in the U.S when it goes up and when it goes up it's quite the opposite so you see manufacturing down when manufacturing is down trucking is down transportation went through you know a slow down between a\nTwenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen and and there\nAnd it was one that people really had not you know looked at I guess we hadn't been watching closely enough\nBut that is the effect of a you know of of a a rising dollar\nAnd that is the fact that again it that makes it a you know it it it changes how people are our trade partners do business with us so that means manufacturers here and then the sucked the sectors that will\nSupport them like transportation and that's what by the way the freight um was one of the\nItems that PG listed along with uh the the materials cost oil and freight costs rising again that that goes against earnings so all of this is the the market assessing a what is happening there are there are things that are an adjustment as as an expansion of\nWell by the way that the the cost of oil whether you agree with that or or or not right and it's also based on on the government policy of foreign of foreign policy of saying okay we need to put the sanctions on against Iran which does what means there's\nLess soil and again this isn't a judgment on whether you agree with it or not it's just the reality of supply and demand right of regulation of making things more expensive for whatever reason will hurt in an economy\nAlone and and I think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia and and talk you out I Know what they have been able to because they basically are now that I mean they and they have been for a long time they are OPEC if you if you talk about the\nYou know the controller inside the OPEC member nations it Saudis and so they're talking about them increasing you know and and uh\nLet her vision better value the ...

that around two forty pm local time\nUh the pair was such a dog it'd be orbiting outpost six hours after launch but the booster rocket failed minutes after launch and they came back in what they called ballistic dissent mode which means they came back in a\n... whatever the crap does I don't know how this works but they had no steering you basically are following it essentially is falling back to earth ah it it now we've been told through a couple of reports that they have been in contact with rescuers their lives they are alive\nAnd described as in good condition so as we'll we'll follow the story anything that gets to a ...\nA before we get out of here this morning ah we we will bring to you right now\nLet's get with meteorologist Tom hale get the latest on tropical storm Michael as an update a little over half hour ago says sustain wins at roughly fifty miles an hour\nHe was right uh dramas you were right on that we ask you about an hour ago where you expected that report to put those sustained winds and it it it was fifty miles an hour\nAnd a and one mile increase in northeast forward movement to yeah and uh and and your check is in the mail [laughter]\nIf you look at this uh again and I think in terms of fifty mile\nAn hour straight wins that is still a very dangerous storm yes I'm Sorry you know why she stayed with\nWinds yeah that's right doesn't include gosh brightest throughout the evening when we started this evening we're looking at eighty to eighty five mile an hour winds above the deck it about four thousand feet and so any good\nAnd this storm could translate that down now the heaviest rain is south of Greenwood and moving into Colombia and Orangeburg right now spinning its way out of out of a\nColumbia and a Athens and and so\nThe ah the storm itself has feeder bands and those feeder bans are moving their way in North Carolina and those are the ones I have the greatest concern about a kicking off tornadoes\nAnd so between Augusta and Colombia is where the heaviest rain is falling right now and so that's between north of twenty a highway twenty and sounds of three eighty five and so that rain\nAnd we need to talk about this flooding thing\nFlash flooding is going to be a major issue it's going to stretch all the way from Charlotte all the way up the Raleigh Durham and from there it's going to go up through Newport and probably just in to Ocean City Delaware and that area all the way up the coast\nIs going to be a threat for science flash flooding because a parcel of air doesn't matter what a parcel is just call it a pencil okay straight up into the atmosphere if you squeeze the moisture out of that you would get over two inches of rain\nAnd so this atmosphere is rich with moisture and prime and so this is the kind of system a tropical systems that are real good at bringing out the sponge and bringing down that moisture and so that's what I'm concerned about because\nTwo to three inches of rain falling in the areas near Fayette fill up the Raleigh up the Wilson that area that whole area from Florence up the Fayetteville is is low lying area and easily uh because of Florence itself could\nTop more trees more flooding and then the flash flooding is going to be\nMore line in line with Raleigh and um and back right where you're at the base of the foot hills that that take you back up into the ...\nAnd
