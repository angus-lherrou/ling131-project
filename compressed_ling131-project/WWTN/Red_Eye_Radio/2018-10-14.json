question recovery and rebuilding the coup that\nPresident Trump told reporters that the United states should not halt military sales to Saudi Arabia even if it is proven that Washington Post contributor your mouth is Yogi was killed inside the country is kind of lead in Turkey\nIn terms of a quarter of a hundred and ten million dollars think of that a hundred and ten million dollars of all they're going to do is give it to other countries and I think that would be very foolish for our country but there are other things we can do it that will be very severe\nPeople in the Florida Panhandle are beginning to put the pieces of their lives back together in the wake of hurricane Michael corresponded Erica Haile says Mexico beaches Mayer says it will be along the road to recovery\nThe other thing is as we've said I'm with the trade war and ... that's a tax increase tax increases are not good a ...\nRaising the cost of goods and services irrespective of the slogan to do it as irrespective of the slogan that is used to justify to do it ... economics doesn't care about us slogan\nNo in it or you look at the dynamics of of that situation where are you have producers here on the U.S or that have their cost their their raw materials costs going up a PG for example\nBut then of course the cells that are lost in the exports\nAre from the retaliatory tariffs from the other side\nAnd and then the dynamics of the price you\nYou want the the product from wherever it is outside the U.S new pay you're going to pay because of the tariff right and then the producer at the domestic\nProducer of a similar product because part of it is protectionism then they're going to raise their prices because you know they're being hurt so they're justified in raising their prime because they can and because they can and all they have to be as a penny cheaper than the foreign product\nTo be competitive tell me tell me why that's a positive\n\nAh we have stated that are all along and I do think that again the uncertainty because still today Congress completely silent ... are on the uh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA mhm uh a steel tariffs aluminum tariffs\nWhich adds to the base cost of how many thousands tens of thousands of products out there\nWhich as we've seen in a and I don't know I haven't seen an update on it we know that in the first half of the year steel is up forty percent mhm uh we know that the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA does not cover steel and aluminum and until there is a deal\nThe tariffs from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins and some of those cases still\nRemain with Canada and\nMexico so you know we stated it when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA for the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference ah you you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA\nYeah he did a little bit but he didn't do anything that he planned that he\nSaid he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit right that this ... this isn't going to do it\nThere were little winds here or there the problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem\nIs and the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car in Mexico the United states\nAnd Canada making it more expensive to produce the car therefore making it more expensive to buy a car and making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas\nHas just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right\nIt's the one thing they're ... they're a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I have no idea where the president stands on it as we know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week he'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protectionist\nTo sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that in this in the the\nUh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA that he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a car and producing a car in North America\nHe put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies [laughter]\nThe original ... the original Tara babies as the president said now you know something we you know we laughed at it I Wonder how many farmers were laughing at that comments out well because the you know he talks about protecting the farmers in\nThe move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the the the the the fuel producers don't don't want it they don't want the higher blend does it it\nIt may sound like a good deal to be able to uh sell the Fifteen\nIn the summer first of all here\nThat we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chain they're going to go somewhere else so it's not just well the tariffs hurt us until they were lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal you know or or the\nThe the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to uh to to terrify\nYou're not there I end up all anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious the president used the greatest victory and that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories\nAnd their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services right we don't know how that's a victory right we can figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question\nMhm\nYeah I mean bands at when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork or as we call it Canadian Bacon\nAnd the when they set up that supply chain if they're happy without agreement why do they go back to us for what would they are with any of those products from a domestic\nProducer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process then you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else are we said this\nDuring the you know the um during the permit tore him after the uh when when the Gulf\nSpill happened the BP thing\nThat that whole thing where you had companies the producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling\nAnd you're not going to give us a permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right and so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't\nDeal with you know the the shift in policy\nOr you know on a ...\nAt the staff of finger and and frankly\nThe ethanol thing is to become you know ... for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking the political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa I mean and\nFor those people that the New York times I'm listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is the state in the middle of the

yeah I'm\nTaking a look at the uh overnight markets and a globally and it looks like a again sing it down to it as well around the around the world how long lived is that it is\nThe president's a trip as he announced on a Thursday morning it was going to try and go into China mhm right so how\nLong is a I guess this going to to last that the market you what you're looking at his earnings reports the Bee Gees ten percent drop was based on what happened to them and the third quarter and that situation has not changed at this point\nOr because they they talked about three dynamics there and that's raw materials a freight uh and and the and oil costs\nUm if the president gets to China they get a deal done on terrorists\nI was just a it was just\nReading something it at Business Insider talking about the uh what is going on right now with a you know with trying to their exports to the U.S continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they say they're still moderately strong\nWell it doesn't change the the trade deficit right\nThe scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property consider mhm that's the real thing that the president has to address I mean the terror thing is going to have to be remedied but it's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be\nAnd it's not just pressure from the U.S\nWhen the ... when the president announced that he was going to you or it was announced that the president would be going to try to sit down with a\nShe in China well that we need everybody at that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying this can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules\nThe\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see you're going to see an adjustment on the stock market the stock market is the least of your concerns\nThat the reason it's suggesting is because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned\nUh the fed with interest rates are the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices to to go up or the Saudis have some play in that too yes and we'll see if they ramp up production and\nAnd and our enable and change that and it is an incentive uh uh again because it makes it\nMore profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well it depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point\nA to a to get to we're not there yet\nBut as we ... really one of the most under reported stories of the entire year ... is that the United states is now and it\nHappened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world\nMhm yeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did by the way I think that's\nThe number one reason I continue supporting um uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way

even held to hold a town hall meeting last friday\nTo to talk to their employees about about this whole issue tolerance yeah yeah that's what it was it was tolerance oh my God [noise]\nYeah well this we are attacked showed up not political but we're talking about tech related things and how tech affects people and opinions and and so forth we probably upset a whole bunch of folks now and that's fine but tell us\nYou know stand by tomorrow you set as opposed to tell us how you feel exactly and it's an F. B. dot com by the way if you didn't notice is a short cut for Facebook\nBut slash into tomorrow post something on there and and share it with us or call us at eight hundred eight nine nine in to\nKeep a tech related but we want your opinion about it\nAnd we'll probably get you on the air if you keep a tech related if you just want to rent\nAnd wind and do stuff that we do it's not that we probably won't put it on the air but yeah but we have microphones that is true so yeah when you when you grow up and have your own radio show [laughter] you to get tolerance is the key\nI Hope they take that to the Supreme Court now [noise]\nI guess Google's hoping that we would all ignore their latest major security issues by announcing a few new products they announced a new pixel three a tablet computer into Google Home speaker with built in display copy election much a button [laughter] Google Plus\nIs finally shutting down I didn't even know it was still a thing because they've been trying to cover that up along with their other big sufficient covering up father my gosh I mean seriously show of hands keep one on the wheel if you're driving\nHow many people are have have even been using Google Plus\nNobody to three All right that was that in the entire audience\nSo oh my gosh breaking news they're going to shutter a Google Plus a major security bug allowed hackers to access Google Plus user profiled data since all the way back in twenty Fifteen all the way back three years ago\nBut I'd probably still had an account I just never used it it was like because nobody's usually get why should I bother and I never did\nBut they uh they claim Google discovered and patched it back in March\nBut they didn't bother to tell anyone not letting the public know not letting their members no bad Google I Wonder if he could have Googled it [laughter] I don't know maybe since March something were to come up\nA bit if you asked on being you'd probably get some info but maybe Google's hiding it I mean they're trying to they're trying to hide all kinds of stuff to be able to do business in China so why wouldn't they\nCensor everything while\nWalmart is trying to ... designed for a biometric feedback cart handle a shopping cart full of measuring shoppers heart rate temperature speed and amount of force if they apply to the handle as they walked around the store and whether you live in a trailer park yeah\nI'm right maybe they can determine that I don't know\nOr the ... shows the court would first measure a baseline biometric data and then compare it at different points in a shopping visit to the baseline foe to see if you're getting angry maybe getting angry getting excited the data would then be we laid back to a central server and if indicated the supper was not satisfied\nThe central server would send an alert to a shopping assistant to go and help the customer right because of their stupid mess that say may I help you and they don't or in this case in Miami don't even speak English um they're they're gonna be so helpful yeah [laughter]\nSo I so let me get I guess if you're then going down there do they still use the big smiley faces for price drops or something that I so so if you see a smiley face they want to see a with a biometric card handle\nIf you react to the smiley face and if this maybe if the sale price looks really good and they're going to say well we're doing something good let's do more of that or if you're angry because you're grabbing the cart going down the aisle because you can't find what you're looking for\nAnd then they're going to send one of these helpful helpers over most tells me he is now I've got to make sure I wear like sickle weather gloves when I go shopping or I don't really ever go shopping at Wal Mart but if I ever had to do in the air so that they can't you know ... me and following me around the store and say how can they help you see that you're not really happy there you go it's a ... at the kind of glove that you can where is the kind that you can't do anything on your smartphone\nIs you know it'll work and then should hide your biometrics\nBut where are they experimenting with us from entering after they've applied for the ... oh so it's just a short time about Twenty years from now maybe [laughter]\nThey have the money they're probably do it by next year ... while Facebook Portal is a kind a camera smart speaker system of video chatting\nMy view from a company that's recently earned a notorious title for mass data breaches I'm Talking about Facebook many are saying that this new Facebook devices dead on arrival because of possible spying concerns\nWould you have one of those in your home their their cameras smart speaker smart speakers one thing smart speaker with a screen fine but with a camera that's\nAll the way I mean if the smart speakers always listening for their trigger word like Alexa play into tomorrow on tune in and hopefully that started our latest episode for you [noise] um [noise] yeah it's\nA good thing we are like ... is outside the studio on um we should see what happens there\nBut if it again fine but it's always listening same thing by the way with okay Google and you know all the other thing because we all the other things that are listening sequel they got rid of okay Google long time ago oh is it ... it was it so\nWe have both here and I buy mess with both of them just to see uh I Try to get them to argue with each other and that makes it even more fun [noise]\nBut that's okay but the Mike's always and and people are concerned some people are concerned about [noise] are they listening you know I don't think you have to worry about that but what about a camera\nHow do you know when it's on do you know when it's on\nTo somebody else know when it's on ... you know I I live alone so I'm not worried about the microbes from was the thing that I live alone so I talk to yourself yeah but I live alone so I'm worried about the camera always being on a policy that's all that's all we want to know because otherwise TMI [laughter]\nGosh Joe in the cooler not Dakota right the cooler there's no are there okay the coolest Georgia he listens on AM nine twenty the answer a joke\nI was saying a lot of these different I T T the platforms are very low cost anywhere from Fifteen dollars to\nMaybe twenty five dollars I wondered how

P. T.

their content through a platform that passes part of the cost of delivery on to you the consumer in other words they send it to you\nDo through the Internet and the infrastructure to get it into your home is up to you not them\nYou know that is for which one is the best value that's really up to you know they all are for about the same service but there can sometimes be small differences and the channels they offer it's mostly down to which one has the content that you want to know who does have one advantage over the rest which is one of the reasons why it's a service I use my home\nI mean that is that for the same price they all seem to roughly charge you also get access to Hulu is huge streaming library other than that they're all pretty comparable or they usually are all our for our mind DVR services and they all offer live local channel ...\nLiable scalable since two thousand stream guys fighting all of these streaming services for the smartest businesses on the Internet\nStream

is that easy to our next guest joined just to talk about their portfolio of mobile social entertainment apps that are designed to meet the universal need for human connection\nMight react with oh isn't that sweet while they do good job of it the c._e._o. of the meat group M E T group is Jeff Jeff welcome into tomorrow how are you sir\nI'm very good thanks for having me\nIt's a pleasure of when we solve the meat group and and it's all about this universal need that obviously I guess we all have for for human connection\nWe thought we've got to look into this more maybe get you guys on the show a tell me a little bit about the meat group and then let's get into some of the things you you're working on these days\nOr so we're a collection of mobile meeting apps we have for primary apps\nMeet me tag will do and scout\n'em all and we have about or a little over four million people logging into our apps every day cool all around the world and we like to\nReally think of ourselves as kind of the the neighborhood bar the coffee house so it's it it has an element of social dating it's also kind of just a meeting space where people can chat I'm hanging out on and what we've been focused\nOn really for the last number of the year and a half has been building out our our live streaming video platform\nOkay very cool I like the the the bar connection even if you're not a bar person you kinda get the idea of\nYou know a lot of folks just like to stop after work and have a refreshing adult beverages and chat with some friends and and people kind of get that idea only in this case you provide your own beer I guess if you're if you're going to reach out to rent but it is kind of a cool an analogy I guess to think in terms of\nOf meeting in that sense that you also you guys talk about the deaths of cat fishing so first of all for those listening that maybe don't know what that means tell us what cat fishing is and then how do you end up killing it\nWell I'm you know I think\nThe picture as a person typically use is on a dating site tend to become a outdated and and they might pick up a picture that they um had you know from a particularly good angle [laughter] I'm from six years ago um you know and and and the person might be unrecognizable I'm\nCertainly get excluding it's even them right there to make a million people that I think that in other very fair a\nFair and I think you know video because they\nYou know it it's real time um and it's a it's it's not a prerecorded video was a live stream and had the level of authenticity to it that I think people find refreshing like I don't think people are expecting everyone to look like a model backing them to be real and and I think that's what that that part of what life during video brings the equation\nYeah we've had listeners but have told us that they've asked people to take a picture with or something that shows today's date or something like ... I was like a hostage situation you know but but identity idea it's like people have become so desperate\nTo know if that's really the person I'm Talking to or does that really look like you know these\nDays because we all change um hopefully for the better but let's face it sometimes age doesn't do well for some of us ...\nAnd as a result I Love your concept about the whole real authentic look of a person because you're looking at a live video now when you say it's a stream would only be going say to me if I'm trying to live video with somebody or my live streaming to whoever might be watching\nThat currently we have a a live streaming platform it allows you to\nConnect to broadcast it basically anyone\nOn the app who wants to watch and um\nAnd what we're seeing a north of twenty percent says it's twenty twenty five percent of our used every single day\nKind of engaging in that um and that that's been going really well what we're actually going to be launching is I'm a one to one version of the same things so you can be doing I'm exactly what I'm kind of you're talking about ... but having a a one on one shot and and that will be a launching very\nWell and quick what seems really cool to me is that you're you are broadcasting obviously something I Know a little a little about the fact is that you might then have it in this case it's a dating app so you might be looking for people and they might be looking for you you might get several responses\nAnd then when you moved to this one on one opportunity then you have even more of a chance of saying hey let's let's let's actually get together and say hello let's have a cup of coffee or something but then to me I\nThink that's right I think that's right and and I think that you can you can actually do that today and they experienced a lot of people do use it that way mhm so um they will broadcast to a number of people and then they will\nSet up private private chat so they'll send a text based chat and then they will connect them go have coffee or go out for a drink like what what what the quick feature allows is for that kind of video um group chat to essentially become a video ...\nYeah and it is always lived in the archives them and play them back some times or something or maybe it's on when you're on\nYour on when you're on I think there's an element of um of affect morality that that our audience likes like they they it's not about about kind of archiving and having it be there for forever as yeah it's kinda more in the moment\nGood no I'm I'm loving everything I'm hearing about it and I think it will help a whole lot of people and and certainly something new and very much into tomorrow as opposed to the way things have been handled up until now so I think what you're doing with the meat group a is very cool\nAnd now for folks that might be concerned about safety issue you're talking about broadcasting ah and then maybe connect with a one on one chat\nBut we're not giving out of our own personal phone numbers at this point or anything else uh the one on one chat is something still through your app right so if it turns out that you find out that oh well this guy's a loser or that that girl forget it you know whatever news and you simply move on right\nThat's exactly right we we certainly encourage broadcasters not to share personal details like home address phone number yeah it sure\nWe also have a quite a commitment to um to just constant moderation so it ... you know being a live video platform at scale you on on a given day we might have\nBeen many many hundred thousand broadcasters seven hundred and fifty thousand plus viewers you have a lot of a lot of content\nUm were you actually have a kind of small army about forty percent of our workforce dedicated to kind of reviewing these streams we also use 'em back and software for\nA day I was wondering what the best home secure they flipped him like a huge cause I'm not home much so I like to know what your system you'd recommend\nWell okay we'll be glad to see if we can't give you some input along those lines if possible a but it's a pretty hard question to answer I got to tell you we've tried a few in our own studios like eighty an alarm dot com were was very unresponsive\nBut luckily they didn't have to get put through a a real world burglary test a I have enough cameras around the house and\nHopefully that's helping to and that we have heard good things about from point a mainly because they don't use proprietary equipment which means that you can add features like cameras for a lot less and you're not tied to them for the rest of your life if they don't meet your expectations\nI'm isn't also has a lot of good fans a minute maybe good option for you if you're a fan of home automation simply safe is another one that's got a popular option going forward if you will\nUh they've got proprietary equipment but it tries to make up for that with the sixty a trial\nThat includes that equipment so if it doesn't work out for you you give the cameras another hardware back to them they're alarms don't require a monitoring plan and will continue to work without one which is not something that every company can say these days as most of course try to hook you\nUp so that you keep paying them a monthly fee and I was supposed to keep in mind if you're trying to get a you're a discount on your homeowner's insurance have has to be monitored plans with most insurance companies that is true um but eighty comes with a free professional installation but that means that you have to be there and wait for them to do it you do however get\nA T service for a competitive price in eighty has been around for a long time\nAnd they seem to be trusted by a lot of people um over the newcomers\nUltimately you may have to see what it might cost for your particular property some workout okay for small places that are very costly to expand so that might be affected a look into\nYeah and you gotta figure when a company like ADD says oh free installation well you there's nothing ... you're paying for it in the long run certainly in the monthly fee it's imbedded in included what have you\nBut that's their marketing come on if you will\nSo you really got to just do some investigating we gave you a whole bunch of other company names to and always know especially a Norman or

everybody\nMinimum Fifteen dollars an hour but he's taking it from other exactly and that has caused so that's caused a huge uproar with a lot of the warehouse workers that have been there for years because they're saying that now these new people are going to come in and they're gonna be making what it took me years to make\nAnd the folks that have been there getting bonuses and things each take something like the bonuses and starts up just stock options away from other employees to pay for God you have Jeff needs more of his own stock yeah\nOh my God [laughter] again you hit the nail on the head of the almighty dollar yes Alexa sent me some money\nAnd that's not going to work just like the last time you went to grocery shopping and you had a special item on your suffering like you know and I and I wish I could also restrict voices talking to my Alexa because yeah I I Do build my shopping list and I I get to the store and I'm going through my list and what do I see on there\nA million dollars for Chris what public didn't have it I asked\nMaybe next time you're living in the rain check it no no rain check they did suggest however that I go by a lotto ticket\nOf course it and all that they could do so there you go but I did have to hit the button that says I picked up that item so we got off my list you know I didn't mind when your son did it because at four and five years old it's cute you know candy for ... and I well you know what I'm going to get some because he was so cute and doing that\nBut I refused to get your million dollars at public supermarket\nFine so they're so stay off my election [noise] and get off my lawn\nWhile you're at it in a boy from any drivers ways is the go to ... for getting around pesky traffic jams now the alphabet owned company is making a risky move into car pooling ... ways announced the nationwide rollout of ways car pool a dedicated app that lets drivers offer rides to people who are traveling on a similar out\nThe company says it wants to leverage it superior robbing technology\nTo help commuters fill empty seats in their cars and in the process hopefully reduce the number of cars on the road\nDrivers are paired with writers with a nearly identical commutes based on home and work addresses now in California ways ... are charged a maximum rate of fifty four cents per mile which is the current IRS reimbursement rate for business travel by car and drivers and writers are limited only to ride per day\nSo you have to pay right but they they're basically you're paying I guess you're paying the person who owns a car that fifty four cents their mother saying that's not it's not a money making thing it's just a way to try to test the technology and get more cars off the road\nTo hopefully maybe reimbursed that person for some of the gas that they're spending and the wear and tear identical over the fifty four cents per mile comes to yeah which certainly seems reasonable if you'd rather not drive or you want to only drive one day a week if the you know five and your group work in the same general area\nThat kind of makes sense so I got to give them a little at a boy for that one\nIf it works out yeah so we'll see if there's you know trying to roll it up nationwide so we'll see how it can that's on Google's ways right okay Google Maps has a new commute tab\nAvailable in eighty cities so far I present real time information on delays plus alternative routes an estimated travel times the Android version will provide updates to enable commuters to continually adjust their routes and avoid delays which I kinda thought it was doing anyway\nBecause if you use Google Maps it generally routes you differently or tells you the accident ahead or or delays and suggests to reroute or something\nLike I've had because I use Google Maps you and I'm mindful and I find it much better than the apple maps and I've been on a route where it all of a sudden pops up on on the road saying hey a faster route has been has been noticed whatever I Want to take it and so it's you know I've done that were saved me some time\nSo the press release for this story seemed like it was old news but I checked it was current but I guess it just does different things because of talking about the real time information on delays\nWhereas sometimes in the past when we've all experienced that too actually ended up ahead and it's all red and yet you're moving along as if it were green and then you get to where they set an accident occurred there's nothing there well president was cleared up but he didn't remove it\nYet or Instagram said this week that it has started using new technology capable of detecting online bullying and photos a move that highlights effort from the tech companies to use artificial intelligence to moderate their platforms\nAdam ... the new head of Instagram said well the majority of photos shared on Instagram or positive and bring people joy occasionally a photo is shared that is unkind or unwelcome\nInstagram says they are now using machine learning technology to proactively detect bullying and photos and their captions and send them to the community operations team to review instruments parent company Facebook also introduced its own anti bullying tools this month\nThose features allow users to remove troll comments from their feeds what the options to delete or hide comments in bulk can report\nComments on behalf of the victim ...\nI Wonder in terms of pictures if they're like doing things like if someone appears to have a fist near someone's face or something like that because otherwise how is the picture going to going to alert them as possible bully I don't know but I've seen this on Facebook to where people who shared videos of what the animal cruelty and it shows the videos\nBlurt out there's a a button on their says it this video has been blocked or click here to view on canes violence or where it warns you of the head of the time but that same kind of machine learning that using that alerts Instagram\nBut I'm Glad it's going to a human first rather than just block it because it's like no I'd say it was no bullying at all there what are you talking about\nYou know I was raising my fist and excitement or something not ... whatever I I guess it's still more tweaking but interesting that they're using AI to try to find these things and see if it'll help\nAnd hopefully a human going to be able to look at it and go oh no that's fine that's approved or yeah that one should be marked as potential bullying therefore be aware or remove it or whatever it is that they do but it's so much censorship on the parts of\nOf Facebook and Google and admitted to get the internal memos lately that are leaking and so forth that they're all admitting they're yeah they're going to more censorship than free speech anyway it's like Oh nice\nUh Americans still do most of their shopping in stores and fashion retailers including reformation and the new Nordstrom men store\nAre staying competitive they say with tech driven experiences retail innovations study author Robin Lewis says that we're going to see an explosion of new tech ideas and new technologies that bring great experiences\nAnd that basically as a whole lot of saying nothing of it I think what he means perhaps or she Robin I'm is the fact that perhaps with augmented reality virtual reality things of that nature as a shopping experience\nA lot of stores now are doing some experimenting with having you put on a virtual reality headset\nAnd then dressing you in various clothes or fashion items and things of that sort of to see what you think without having to go try everything on but just you know display and then have you move around to see if you like it and\nIf that's what Robin means yeah of course it's twenty Eighteen tech is a very big elements in all kinds of shopping\nAnd you know really the only store that I shop and then I don't mean to sound like a commercial target but targets really the only store I Will like go to shop even Walmart you know local woman here is not the best so I Will order online for store pick up and then just go to the back and pick up my stuff ... I don't have to walk around the store and and the grocery store I go to other than that but if I Can't if I Can't find it online I don't need it\nMuch true and a lot of people are appropriately thinking that way and ... nothing wrong with that\nIf you're so used to being able to do some online things than uh well I mean the brick and mortar stores technologies disruptive by its very nature stuff happens but that's why as I mentioned Nordstrom and others are are saying okay we've got to just get more tech involved we\nWant them to come into the store but you know I I for example I have clothes shopping or shoe shopping hate it hate it ate it and I don't want to go try on things you know I mean most of the shirts I have a gift that you and others in the family of given me or something because I don't want to go shop for the stuff I don't care\nYou know not a fashion icon\nYou know you're agreeing have is going to ask us to stay quiet yeah but the fact is if I see

giving you easy access to many free tools to check the background for example of financial professionals and stay informed on the latest fraud schemes our next guest joins us\nAs the deputy director of the office of customer education and outreach us commodity futures trading commission who when I think it all fits on his business card to Dan Rather for Dan will come into tomorrow how are you sir\nIt right ... thanks for having me\nIt's a pleasure to have you with us and and that's a long title for an organization that as I mentioned can help with ah maybe fraud scheme things that we as consumers\nShould be aware of can you give me a kind of a better idea of what your group does the commodity futures trading commission and then we'll get into some of the specific you have horse\nSure well the the the FTC for short a has been around since the seventies where independent a federal agency that oversees the commodity futures and derivatives market place\nAnd going back several years ah we've looked at crypto currency is as a commodity and several include that among some of the products that we regulate\nA but we are are also charged with you know making sure that not only the the markets function as they should but also to help protect the public from fraud and and other deceptive practices out there\nTalking about the rise of of crypto currency digital currencies creating new challenges for consumers like we've never seen before a I'm Wondering what it is that you guys are able to do to help but in that the perspective\nThat yeah so that's very true um there has been a lot of attention on cooked a currency to specially since uh towards the end of last year when\nCouple of our regular exchanges the commodity mercantile exchange and Chicago Board options exchange both self certified\nOr the creation of a bitcoin futures a some took that to to provide greater legitimacy to crypto currency that virtual currencies and that tend to cause a great deal of a a public interest\nUm but uh you know what we generally tell people the cash markets where these\nCoins or traded where you go to actually you know provide your a debit card or bank information to buy virtual currencies those markets are largely unregulated and though they may be registered with some states as a money exchange companies where you can send money to other folks\nAre but they're not regulated like exchanges where you advise commodity futures contracts or or stocks and bonds that sort of thing so that we that they don't have the customer protections\nIn place a or buyers and sellers nor do they have a you know the safeguards in place that would protect a folks if\nSay they exchange where to go under that sort of thing so you really have to be careful when it comes to dealing with these cash market\nNow if there is fraud or manipulation involved in trading we can step in and take and force them in action and those were guards uh but uh again the the exchanges themselves we don't have a lot of a disability or oversight of wild\n... will then do you see that changing I mean does that take literally an act of Congress to to get your group a commission to be able to uh to do more with you know the bitcoins of the world and things of that nature just to make sure that things stay on the up and up\n[noise] uh well it really does and and I know Congress is looking at that and they've asked us for information and as well as the FCC and other regulators are to sort of get involved in providing but um but that may be you know\nA a ways away before final rules are actually drafted men in the meantime like I said if if you know\nIf people experienced broader manipulation they certainly have someone to turn to you and they can turn to us in\nAnd that's excellent and I'm noticing a smart Chek dot Gov which is your sight of were able to do things like run background checks on uneven traditional brokers or maybe online brokers some financial professionals that we need\nAnd should get more information on before we hand over our money to them\n[noise] yeah that's exactly right and what we're seeing in terms of the connection between virtual currencies which again are sort of new and developing and the regulatory framework um\nThere are a number of existing frauds are frauds that have been occurring on line for many years that are adapting are morphing a crypto currency is into their schemes are one\nMajor example a or a binary options are these are protective options um generally they can be traded in the U.S legally on registered exchanges\nAnd that's where a tool like smart check comes into play but what we tend to be are a lot of fraudulent websites that call themselves exchanges\nThat operate offshore and largely out of reach of law enforcement and so what they'll do is they'll promise an easy way and to investing and crypto currency is at a low cost and low risk it returns and the whole nine yards\nBut really they're just a fraudulent way to get people's credit card information and start running up charges appetizer and potentially even cause\nOr identity theft in some cases so in those in those particular scams that the best bet and the best way to sort of avoid being taken is to focus on the first and or the company\nSelling the investment and to make sure that they're properly registered with a\nFederal and state authorities got you do that as smart check back up\nAnd and it sounds like the proverbial if it's too good to be true it probably isn't true and it seems to hit the nail right on the head\nWell when you have these fraud is not necessarily chew good to be true because you know when you have a product that's grown you know thirty eight hundred percent in a year\nSaying that you can get eighty Ninety a hundred percent return than a month doesn't scheme to out of out of a two and comment\nAnd so the reason why people get taken is not because they're necessarily gullible but if because these con artists are really good at what they do and so that's why we say it's it's important to focus first on the individual in the company that's making the sale because if you start thinking about the product\nAnd he started getting or it in by the pitch a you tend to lose sight of whether or not the person or a company selling it is actually legitimate\nGot your and of course ... check dot Gov you can help us determine whether or not they're legitimate but it doesn't stop anyone from saying well I'm going to take my chances I'm just going to go for it well that's entirely up to them and the chances are that they're going to lose their money\nYou can find good options from a virus customers ski a trend micro so foes a bit defender basically any of the big names\nAnd since you're paying you should know that as we mentioned a few minutes ago that there are plenty of free options around so if you're concerned as the amount that it's costing you then there are plenty of those free versions that you can probably take a look at\nUs if you should and stole Norton like we said before you should definitely and install Norton before you saw something else 'cause if you don't want to be anti viruses may actually identify the other one as a potential virus\nUm so keep one anti virus at a time so they don't interfere with each other and you end up unprotected yeah ... that's\nIt is important and it's weird because people have asked us over the years well how could an anti virus program think another competitor is a virus\nIt just kind of works out that way because of of the imbedded code and things are they looking for and you know might have ... virus names and go oh you know fly get\nOr it could just read that their competitors and they want you to have their other went off the off year machine at any number of things but it just works better or at all if you take off\nAny previous anti virus you can always go back to him you can always install it again if you find you've tried two or three or four and you know number two was the best find them and install everything else go back to whatever your second option was more details for you it into tomorrow dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nConnected

at your house\nAnd if you have any of the way the phone from the last several years it'll be capable and once I call me\nThe problem is that you're in a rural area and your Internet may be as bad as

repeated that you plug in the inside of your house that would work like forever yeah that repeat\nOr can make the difference in of course you're repeating hopefully a good signal so make sure it's in

do inside these may or may not work for you so you know just keep that in mind too\nYeah but again why calling a lot of opportunity there I remember being on the phone with delta because they screwed

talk as much as we can about on this program over the years is stem learning new first of all if you would let her audience know which stem is all about and then let's get into some of the very cool things you guys are doing\nCertainly well some of the real buzzword now but if you have inherited it says ... stands for science technology engineering and math and those are some of the most um\nLucrative positions and and the most successful positions that people can get into a career wise and the idea is is that if you introduce children to stem skilled at a younger age to replay that there'll be ready to face the academic challenges and and then the the career challenges that are involved in those type of position\nAnd I am so thrilled that you and your team of taken it upon yourself to work with stem learning because we certainly need a lot more of that from our country for folks to be able to get more involved in tech and an engineering and all and of course math obviously\nAnd and I use is is so important ... of how is it that you particularly want to engage young people are in helping forward the stem learning process\nSure I well you know for us in our company Anita on toys we've always equated them with innovation so there's so much everything's written today about the next big thing like what industry it could be completely changed by innovation and how innovative advancements in technology or other areas can be targeted at some of the world's major problems\nSo none of these grand successes would be possible unless to sustain or to accomplish unless we have a continuous pipeline of creators and innovator who live and breathe the ability to disrupt technology or to imagine technology that could do something so noble and grand sleeping as they saved countless lives so\nUm how are we going to keep that pipeline found that ... they have to introduce kids to innovation and threw them that's how you can get them to start thinking most the most innovative place so\nUm they once you get these skills they're easily could reinforce into adulthood\nAnd even kids and didn't that aren't going into engineering or the creative field Cancun and you'd have that ability to think innovative right so what we do it our at our company is make games that make it make sure that children and I think the only girl\nAre introduced to
