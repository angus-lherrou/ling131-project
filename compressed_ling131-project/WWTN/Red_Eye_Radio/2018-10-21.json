I Can't remember the head of the CIA guy\nUm if we don't prosecute these people for the crimes that they did a weirdo were no better than a third world or the third world country we're letting these people get away with what was wrong illegal unconstitutional and basically all those things make make I'm an American\nAnd the if if we don't take people who commit treason and prosecute him for that then they're going to keep their little following that they're going to walk around you got plenty of people out there that are saying that well you know ... evidently it was it that bad they did break the law they didn't do anything that was so evil and\nUm it it's [noise] I I just think that something needs to be done to show them and along with all that you know freezer assets because they're ill got games in the Clinton Foundation and I mean if we're going to go all out\nOr go all lead on Kavanaugh for thirty five years ago I I'm sure we can find plenty of people and evidence for what Bill did back in the eighties\nSo I mean why can't we go that route\nWell you can and although someone challenged me and said what about the civil war right they committed the certainly are illegal acts at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff but\nThen this is a wartime assistant war time\nThis is it people who actually are saying that the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy were fighting the this is I have a different view on on the civil war them some people do I mean I I I understand that\nFor some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach with the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the base it\nThere were a lot of us were fighting and all that okay go ahead\nNo you know I'm just letting you finish gr\nOkay now but I mean that's so that's where I mean to me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of states' rights to me that represents states' rights over\nSlavery and when I talked to people and I've actually talked to people who have\nFlown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever that's what I asked him I said okay now\nWhat does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with you know states' rights and an overreach from the federal government and\nThe people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that that I just you know okay what makes you better than anybody else\nWhy why or why are you better than that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between\nAn old dovetail hear the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are evidently irrelevant at this point and that is we engage in conversation we engage in discourse defend your defend your principles defend what your argument is\nThey just want to shout you doubt that want to call you names now that is not everybody in the Democratic party that is why I I don't associate that with the Democratic party these are the left wing way out there which comes to who I Would actually have coffee with their there's nobody really on the left politically\nThat I could sit down and have coffee with however I have met George Clooney and she's a really nice guy and very humble and I I could sit down and have a beer at a

think it is a viable candidate that'd be Jerry Brown I'd love to see him run\nI'm really actually is moon I'd love\nI'd love oh I'd love to see him run oh I don't think there's anybody out there that's going to be able to beat Trump\nI really don't and I think he's because he's got one a campaign under his belt for the presidency he he knows a lot more one thing you can say about him he learns and uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons and I don't think he's got to be he was a little\nI don't say soft but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people that\nAnd I think this time he would really\nTrying to be a little bit more aggressive and the way he would uh addressed anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up there because I think each I think you ... the same thing with Elizabeth Warren I think anybody from the left it gets out there he's going to pretty much ...\nI certainly agree with you he's gotten much more comfortable in the job he really has become much more presidential and I think that's what you're saying he's really grown into the job and I Oh absolutely\nAnd and he does is he's been doing really good on everybody's watching what the right hands doing\nActually I should say left because he is science with those right everybody's watching what the left as doing it with his right hand these just sign and stuff sided sign of mine he's getting a lot done why everybody's talking about the rhetoric and looking at the ball bat sticking\nAnd um my my my fiance and I have been a friend did by several people that we went to school with and stuff because you can't talk politics with a user liberals they don't want it they can't defend their arguments they they don't want to talk about\nA

talked about hate\nOr over here on this side that are represented the Democratic party\nAnd when somebody on the white quote right or the Republican Party that comes out spewing hate the Republican Party shouts them down and says no you don't represent the Republican Party David Duke there have been many many\nUh examples of people who have come out on the quote unquote right who's you force

county\nSmartphones play a key role in the lives of billions of people holding intimate secrets financial details are much more so it's usually a good idea to keep your secure where they hard to guess code\nWell Kanye West apparently did not get the memo do or don't have enough during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the oval office last week the rapper up here to unlock his phone where they pass code consisting entirely of zeroes needless to say that it's not a particularly strong security key\nOr the vice president of cloud research at security firm trend micro said the west might not be as vulnerable as the average person considering he has his own physical security um but he said given Mr west high profile and value\nThis person reputation using that simple pass code could result in disastrous consequences if the phone fell into someone else's hands there's also a good reminder to the rest of us to make our past codes a little more difficult and not be so obvious when and putting my password for in the oval office with a bunch of cameras around\nWho of course first of all I remember seeing the video where he was just tapping zeros and I thought to myself okay that bizarre\nAnd what are they going to show us you know is that camera going to zoom into his phone because clearly he was about to show the president something turned out to be flying car allegedly but it was like OK zoom in other words he's showing\nThat maybe the cameraman thought oh this looks like it's a password perhaps I shouldn't be showing that\nOh my gosh well and we don't go a week on our show without reminding you to back up and to protect yourself and to have better passwords\nEspecially this month yeah and I ... a good point this is the months to extra ... mind you about that\nSo Kanye and anyone else who uses single digits are one two three four or zero zero zero whatever don't do that it's not going to help you I mean if you're doing that then don't bother locking your phone because it's got to be very easy to get into and others say hall but I never leave it anywhere it's always with me\nReally you know you've never walked away from a restaurant table what oh he's my phone or something like that or put it down paying for something at the grocery store so you can fumble with your wallet her purse or something\nBut they don't have kids 'cause mine has left it at the grocery store\nYeah because they're using your phone and\nAnything can happen folks so just make sure it's reasonable or if you're using a pattern make it a complicated pattern facial recognition that's what I use because anyone else's not unlucky enough to have this face so chances are pretty good that they're not going to be able to unlock my phone\nAnd as as ... micro pointed out in when you're in putting that code makes you know what else can see it otherwise it might as well just below zero sell the\nForce that that's also true just like when you put your PIN number in for your debit card at the store you know most of them have this little area that kind of helps hide the keypad for you and if not put your other hand up and just hide it because if somebody ends up with your card well now they've also got your PIN number\nAnd hidden user back day you know a lot of people now you're back they\nExactly you know use something that you'll remember but doesn't mean anything to anyone else generally or not very easy to find\nAnd don't use the same could use for something else I had a friend of mine who wants told me that there there are pinned on their phone as easy to remember because they use the same one that they use for their debit\nCard to sit that stupid telling anyone about it is still wonder [laughter] oh my God where they got for us with\nWell seeing you can buy should get paid scanning your feet with your smartphone founder of the Japanese e commerce site and that was that got several hands on Twitter that his company with him let users create three D. scan to their feet and use the measurements ...\nAnd ... those are the witches and spend that ... that can measure the human body and three D. and create custom science close to it but the mentioned okay you\nSure it's not just somebody with a foot fetish shoes trying to get the picture three the pictures of people think\nWell I'm going to go there making it easier to buy his okay\nWe'll we'll see how that works and good luck and good on them for doing something different and if you're scanning her foot I'm sure there are particular guidelines they need certain angles and pictures and and so forth but that might be an interesting way to\nShop at some point I thought yeah waiting here or there ...\nCofounder of Microsoft Paul Allen you've probably heard by now died this past week from complications of Hodgkin's lymphoma he was diagnosed in two thousand nine\nAnd it had return Paul Allen was sixty five so young guys do but ah fought with cancer concerns and then they apparently he was in remission but then came back and and got him obviously so\nAh thoughts and prayers to his family and uh certainly uh an instrumental person in the tech\nWorld palm is best known as a pioneer in the world of a personal digital assistants and smartphones\nAnd even though the company has been dead for years the brand still both a cult following among techies like me who you love I Love my palm and I use them back when they were palm pilot\nBefore they were sued by the ... company and had to drop pilot from their name I don't that was so bizarre so bizarre because they didn't do the same thing but pilot pen company says no no you can't write with it but you can make notes with it you know it's like a pen because I've had a stylist and they were only a palm pilot they decided to ... yeah and one [noise]\nBut uh well the the palm brand has been resurrected and released another phone but a companion device\nThat looks kind of like a baby iPhone and is designed to act as a lightweight substitute for your phone when you're at places like the gym\nIt's basically a phone without the phone park kind of like an iPod\nOr the three hundred and forty and our devices sold exclusively through ... and wireless that requires its own data connection that will add about ten bucks to your bill every month\nBut interesting nonetheless and perhaps we will see what if any people decide to give it a shot it does have some cool features it does look interesting and again it's a palm so it's the palm operating\nSystem right in front and from what I can tell you know I mean I haven't seen that the suspect side by side but it's it looks like it's trying to be a direct competitor to the iPod who is going to do is basically everything the iPhone can do just accept it calls\nRight can't they do that I'm white fi calling we can do because you I was on call I write stories about our message those kinds of things right all work iPod [noise]\nI'm not an eye funny so I don't know about these things but I hear ... don't be sorry I'm fine fine with not being an iPhone\nI'm the only one around that's not an eye for me at least in amongst our staff around line are

... health care trade show we're glad we got 'em on the phone now the co founder of Aurora health is mark Gary mark welcome into tomorrow how are you\nDoing great how are you were\nDoing fine thanks and uh tell me a little bit about a mood pass and then we'll get into some more specifics\nOkay shirt so loop that as a first up and uh basically it answer the question do I have a depression so there are many many people many million people are out there in the United states and then in Germany where where are based\nThat to walk around with that question and don't have an answer around fifty percent of the people affected by clinical depression never actually end up\nSeeing a doctor or a psychotherapist so what the authors of the fourteen day an extended basically where we send you a question three times\nA day or that or basically go through a at at our profile of mental health with a focus on depression and there's a smart dog with them in the background that figures out what the desk next questions are being and after fourteen days we give you an assessment and also clear recommendation and we see evidence for depressive episode\nA and it and and you know what I Am on behalf of folks that are suffering those kinds of issues I think it's amazing that you guys have been able to come up with this sort of course\nLet me set the stage a little bit more I had the uh the honor of helping to moderate a session a during this conduct healthcare a trade fair called apple circus\nAware of the some of the top ten\nApps for health were narrowed down years of course among them a and an awesome a presentation and the ability for the jury to ask questions and and learn more about why\nWhat's happening and you created quite abuzz with folks saying this is really interesting this is truly amazing that you have an app for mental health and then it has helped already so many people were what led you to creating this apt to begin with\nSo I'm not a psychotherapist myself off of behavioral therapist and I've been working with patients over the last ... years and\nI've seen them many times how on you know people describe kind of their journey of of getting into a health can actually you know I'm starting a therapy and I've noticed there how strong\nActually the the roller ... of of Internet apps already is you know we see\nJust a world oil in Germany it's about one and a half million Google searches worldwide we find and and just an English language we find over twenty million monthly Google searches around that key word of depression depression I Do have a depression so\nYou know I just put one in one together basically says I saw there is a huge demand hum of people who\nAre walking around with that question and they're looking for things on line and they really want to and an animal is a easy accessible tool or that empowers them to you know the answer that question for them and can help them\nReally go get over that point um to to really make the decision\nYou know maybe I Need help which you know a lot of people just actually do need help me ... medication or psychotherapy\nSo that was the reason I thought you know um if no one else will do it and then we can do it I can do it so uh we started I found my co founder and he has a business background that\nThey got some investors together to believe in the idea so um yeah we hire developers and develop the concept together with the universities here validated that algorithm\nAh with us in clinical studies and then we launched an English version and then you can a few other countries\nAnd the Android version will go live at the end of this month\nOf ... and kudos to you guys for not only are doing the research to find that more than half the people affected by depression don't seek help and certainly should by all means\nBut knowing that so many people are searching for help and perhaps or ... why do you think mark what do you think is the reason why folks just won't go to a doctor or a generally or or just seek a\nYou know a psychiatrist or psychologist to share a councilor of any sort or is it is it you know fear of of uh maybe being embarrassed or something that they might be depressed or\n... what is the main reason and as a result I guess\nYour mood pass out he's helping to solve that problem\nYeah I Would I Would say so I mean I Would put it into two different um you know two different reason was really I think what you're getting at is really the fear of what what others could think of me you know\nAnd that is very important that's it you know it's it's pretty obvious it's it's a hard situation to be into it you know in front of a doctor or tell your friend tell your family um that you're in the territory that you'd have a mental health problem\nUm but maybe even more powerful poll of powerful problem is I'm really to self ... and a problem that it it it does raise it creates with your own identity and your own expectations to yourself fear a lot of people just\nDon't want that to be part of their identity no they vote you know not\nYou know try not to think about it and try to to push it away and not realize that at all and uh yeah the night to some parts of them might realize it already and they know that\nDo currency might still be decent in some cases but not so much for like\nBuying dinner perhaps how many restaurants do you go to that will accept your crypto currency not too many none that I Know of anyway welcome back to do tomorrow I'm Dave ... unimpressed great ...\nAnd this question of vintage Mars patio in part by huge net high speed Internet available where you live or work text radio to thirty five pounds and again ... radio ... three five zero zero zero\nI shall do just that do try that out in a really pretty cool or just the word radio to thirty five thousand\nAnd you'll get some good info no obligations or anything but it's a fun thing to do lands in Dearborn, Michigan listens on AM eight hundred see KLW the information stage and hello Lance I just\nStarted a new job and one of my co workers has a very small Alexa users to listen to music or are they thinking of getting one for my office but um I I wanted a little bit better sound quality so I was wondering if you could recommend a good a Bluetooth or wireless speaker system like a lecture that well also played really determine\nWhat Lance if you want and the ... speakers that sounds better you can buy in a lecture speaker that sounds better [laughter] believe it or not because your co worker ... most likely has the Amazon Echo dot\nAnd I use one too I actually like a small round speaker roughly about an inch tall looks more like an oversized hockey puck if you will the dot was always meant to be connected do a better speaker if you want to listen to music\nIts own speaker was really expected to be used for voice command responses for her to be able to answer your for example so that's one option you have just connected to any speaker you happen\nTo have available now having said that Amazon offers speakers are actually some good um you can look at the echo or the echo plus for two options with the exact same digital system built in but the hardware to play music is actually one that sounds good [noise]\nUm if you're happy to stray from Alexa Google Home also makes real speakers a tie into its Google Assistant and sound even better in my opinion\nUh the one they market to audio files is the Google Home max but you can also downgrade to the regular Google Home for respectable sound that will probably fill your office without any issues just steer away from home many which is the dots direct competitor\nAnother Google compatible smart speaker to consider is the ... twenty it has very impressive audio quality works at the most populous Cheney need your services and as part of us you can take it with you at the end of the work day to enjoy music at home\nIf you're in the apple at the system to apple home pot has incredible sound quality and with an apple muses subscription giving you access to the largest selection of music available the strain my mind but at three hundred and forty nine dollars you'll be paying a premium\nAs soon as you said apple a new here comes a big price so yeah three hundred and forty nine dollars but again if you're a big music audio file and you're like your music then you might want to spend three hundred and fifty bucks X\nPossibly and hey can ...\nWell there you go yeah yeah and that's a good point because that's the reason I went with the Amazon Echo speakers at my house because I already had an Amazon Music unlimited subscription or that I Wish he works with those actually\nThat'd be great music go with that are up onto the whole money and you do obviously play music a lot around your house so it works out what I did and that yet a little dot\nOrg Google Home many will work just fine if you're not going to use it for like whole home audio for rich music because it's not meant to do those little ones are just meant to be responsive to your\nCommand I have a ... and my six year olds bedroom because he doesn't know the difference in that I've done the actual Amazon Echo in the living room and one in my bedroom or I listen to the most and I get good sound and by the way the music doesn't sound\nTerrible on the little the small ones but it's not meant for that clearly is similar to to what it was something like if you played it from your phone speakers and get it up yeah that's probably a good example so last hope we help you out there and let us know what you end up going with\nAnd of course stay tuned because we always invite our audience to chime in and help Lance and others with similar questions maybe you

technology that part I like\nPart of the project uses virtual reality to immerse kids in a dinosaur themed environment\nTo keep them occupied as they're being treated for various illnesses so to that extent that is good and I think that that's very awesome it they're talking about virtual environments are they using some virtual reality perhaps some augmented reality as well in this new initiative called Dr\nWhich again digital research inform ethics in virtual environments\nYou wonder if they came up with that first and then said hey it spells drive\nOr the other way around because why would you use drive to treat kids anyway you come up with something that kids related\n... they don't drive his kids drive you crazy high there are there okay now I get it up but good luck to them because I think that's awesome and if it will help kids\nDo do with treatments I think I said both of you because you you both have young ones of recent posted I ran across where some doctors offices are now putting kids on the virtual reality headset when it's time to get a shot\nSo they'll play something a cartoon even or anything to distract them but some of the things that they're using actually have the characters in the virtual reality that are rubbing something on someone's arm which then the nurse or doctor would be rubbing the alcohol right\nAnd then they're kind of tapping their arm like you know giving them a you know some kind of good credit or something and the kids are laughing because it's funny or something but that one day then inserts the needle\nAnd deliver the medicine for example a vaccine or what have you\nAnd then they they're the character or seen putting a band aid on the other characters are member what have you and the kids like it and they follow through and then when they're finished they take off the head said oh look I got a bad day just like the character meanwhile no screaming about the pinch\nThe should they should have given me one of those

and\nGiving a few tips to make the work place a little more enjoyable and organize who doesn't want that here to share with us as Google expert from Google Ryan to bone Ryan welcome to tomorrow how are you\nGood how are you Dave I'm\nDoing well anytime we can give advice about how to work smarter or how to how to make things better certainly more enjoyable and and productive and so forth it always seems like that's a great idea but then is it hard enough to get people to to change to do something different in order to make that happen\nOh indeed it is I mean changing change a management is actually a really hard problem as any a business owner or just individual person will ... will tell you because they are used to their existing flows and what ended up happening is over time as we're working we get used to the flows that we've been doing\nThe thing is is that these aren't necessarily the most efficient it's really what we've learned to do in order to get something done and and so we actually looked at this problem and studied\nHow people go about their work week and where they spend their time and how much of it it actually on creative time as well and how much of it on just the overhead of actually producing the work that matters\nWell and to be clear how much how much of his ... is on time on social media as well or or doing things that perhaps are not work related to the boss may not be quite so thrilled with that kind of weather doesn't do it as well right\n... uh definitely it does or you know although I guess we're not trying to be police in these in these instances\nAre really doing is it when you are when you're working we want to make us productive as possible Lovett okay good [noise] so\nAll ask you to how much time do you spend on email and we\nOwe ... way too much I mean I couldn't really tell you because I'm literally on it constantly I mean even as I travel the world headed to China again next week for another tech event and so forth I'm literally on it at any waking moment [laughter]\nAnd you're not alone at the average employee gets about a hundred and twenty emails per day and and when I say that everyone is wow that must be a gross underestimate\nYeah I ... I Wish I only got that many would have had to do and so as\nYou said we spent all of our time uh on email and so you see that that people have you know their smartphones that people do it they have to respond all the time they're walking around like zombies with their heads down typing away on the small screens yeah I'm an ... and you end up spending so much time sending responses ... looking at those responses\nYou know a lot of them fall into similar categories of you know a thank you or check you know congratulating or um any type of number of of different things so as an example um\nEven even time I'm responses and uh we looked at this and said okay well can we actually do something better can we actually save the time of actually writing those types of emails and so we launched something called smart replay earlier this month and Gmail\nAnd what it does is it for every you know coming in and wash you look at the content of email\nAnd will generate three responses at the bottom for you so that time sensitive a notion I mentioned before last week when I got a question of oh I hate when can I get this done the three responses that are generated for me where\nI'm a I'm working on it now I'll get it to you tomorrow or get back to you at the time\nAnd when I look back at my responses they said that those actually had matched what I had written previously and at that because smaller class she learns over time how you write you know if you're a thanks rather than a thank you person are you like to use that information pointed will actually adjust over time\nTo learn my habits and and offered those as responses\nRight exactly and then the idea behind this is that we want to get you to a point where instead of you're trying to tap away and they'd be misspell a on these were repetitive response as you can just with two taps get them done and sent out immediately and go back to your work day\nBut now Ryan let me ask you this and I love that idea by all means ah especially if I can lie and say working on it now [laughter] but but what reminds me then to go back and and read what is now perhaps a marked read email that I Need to follow up on\n[noise] right well keep in mind this is just generating a response for you so you would go and use is a in the work so that you would normally use\nUm so it you know if this is something that you would send it in leaving your inbox is a way of tracking versus\nUm you know using filters or any other set of reminder systems you know this it's still ... volunteer work flow from the key point here is that instead of spending the time that you would normally right writing these emails I mean which some people are ten or thirty seconds per email and if we're talking about a hundred and twenty per day it adds up oh yeah and that's where we're trying to get that time back well\nAnd that makes perfect sense and I think the opportunity there as long as we're not now missing the content of email that we do need to address especially if we said you know I'll get back to you all you have a tomorrow tomorrow comes and goes and we didn't do it because ... was an already read email and we were busy with the other on ready mix ups\nI guess I Would I what I'm concerned about through for people\nYeah the goal is for this to be still your intent not to be you know a a putting words in your mouth right yes oh yes frequently what we see for you to have this they say I think about what I was about to type and you already had a response or if not something better\nUm I mean the best part about this is that it you know with with all of our applications are constantly updating them so if you're a Gmail user you will see this just appear today on your mobile devices it'll just be at the bottom where you can try it out already\nA okay and of course being an Android I Am obviously Google user in every sense of the word so that's something I look I look forward to you guys did a lot of things though in terms of available tools are what are the other things that you guys are working on now that help us do in fact be more productive\nYeah so I mean this this one example um represents how we take all the technologies that we have available to us that are converging today right smartphones or the price of cloud technology is making content always available and machine learning where we're able to make these predictions are based on observations that were taken at where they can get into all of our applications\nFor uh the office which we call the sweet\nI'm an I mean another example where people spend their time where we tried to tried to optimize what was going on as a as meetings I mean I'm you know meetings are not an infrequent thing that happens but it ends up it turns out that people spend as much time scheduling time for the meeting a spending time in the meeting itself so\nJeeze and this gets even worse he how many people who are spread throughout the world yeah um and so we launched the future could find a time\nWhere it will account for things like time zones or when people normally meat and we'll suggest times when everyone can meet\nA a that you've invited and if there is no available time in the near future will actually suggest meetings you can move to make it so that everyone can meet so the idea again is instead of a thirty minute scheduling practice or you can do it in one click\nI Love it and again that that doesn't help make us more productive than I don't know what will\nWell Andrea let's see if we can to unpack that a little bit for you if you're going to be editing large files make sure you have plenty of ram as you did mention but that doesn't matter\nAs much for smaller pictures that you may just take say on your phone\nBut if you're using a professional camera and undone compressed format having the most ram possible will absolutely help things along the processors is important too of course like you said as well but less so than it is for tasks like video editing\nAs fair printer matching colors is not trivial but the main two things you'll need to do is calibrate your monitor and set the right color profile for your printer even then the paper you pick will have an effect to properly matching colors takes a good amount of work and you won't be able to do it by adjusting a single setting and walking away\nUnfortunately that's required calibration and trial in there\nYou know this is your machine that the very least you only sixteen gigabytes of ram it'll be much better with thirty two gig especially if you'll be handling raw photo images which if you're serious about photographer you will be using a raw files aren't compressed Jay pigs so they take up a lot of both ram and storage space\nAnd that's another aspect you want to pay attention to him hard disk space do for at least a terribly space it doesn't have to be an ss decent you'll have lots of ram\nCPU is not as important as the gp you which is graphics processing unit that a chip on the graphics card editing software like adobe photo shop and affinity photo which is a recommendation for editing software for storage an Asset Management take a look at AC DC which is a C. B. S.

and staff experience\nIt's all about cool stuff and the Internet of things and how it relates to us and our health senior vice president for connected digital platforms and propositions not sure what that means from Philips ... will come back into tomorrow how are you\nHey Dave thanks for having me get to the back\nLet's talk about what's been going on with Philip since we last spoke in person at ... at AT T e as you've always got funding things to talk about\nYeah we really been continuing our journey here to try to bring professional health care expertise to to consumers [noise] um I think you and I have talked in the past were observing that um the world that we're living in is really changing that this exponential rate them and people are looking for\nI'm experiencing a seamless transition between different stages in their life on between different experiences of health care whether they're at home or they're in the hospital\nSo we really been trying to work on bringing new meaningful innovations the market that help people make better decisions about their health regardless of where you are\nAnd a funny enough that actually starts right in your mouth\n[laughter] one of the things that I think\nI'm One of the innovations that you saw a U.S present at the S.\nUm in April was the Philips on the care diamond clean smart which is part of our oil healthcare platforms so we don't really look at this um toothbrushes anymore we look at it as\nThe beginning of an oil healthcare platform that really harness this technology to help people better understand um there there are all hygiene causes of poor oral hygiene um and how they can really take control of oral health and effectively therefore start to bridge\nI'm healthier habits that in fact a impact their entire systemic health\nAnd lay out that such a good point and I know if you if you ask any dentist they'll tell you that and then folks should yeah but you'd expect your dentist to say oral health is really important but it does lead to all kinds of other issues if you don't take care of your mouse\nAbsolutely absolutely there's so much that she could learn actually from from your mouth are so many correlations between bacteria in the mouth or for pregnant women for early birth for\nUm for lots of chronic diseases so I think there's there's we're just at the tip of the iceberg of really understanding how all of these different systems in our body than Iraq then if\nWe don't need to wait until we're sick and go to hospitals which is kind of a paradigm that we live in today for health care\nIf we can really start to take more control of our of our health in our everyday lives at home which you start to see already with the wearables trends of the quantified self or what people are doing with ... trackers let what'd you say that at the beginning of that it's it's not just about running if not just about activity tracking um it's it's\nHow do we start to connect the dots on every single part of a skin insights into a deeper health connection whether it's our skin our mouth or blood or heart\nUm are sleeping patterns just to name a few\nAnd if we can start to bring all that in a meaningful actionable way we can actually pro actively worked together with doctors with health care system to try to keep us healthier and and and decrease the need for for for hospitalizations\nAnd of course with the sky rocketing cost for health care whether it be just for our insurance or the health care that that we need at some point it makes perfect sense now more than ever I think to do a whole lot more proactive things for our health\nYou're absolutely right and that's actually one of the key drivers that bringing some of the technology to market so it's because of the increasing costs because our health system can't handle the burden of what's happening um we have more chronic diseases than ever before we have increasing obesity\nHave an aging population that's growing there's no way that if we continue on the current vector our our health care system can handle it so what do you do well you need to change the system lead to start thinking about how do I take health care out of the hospital how do I do more preventative care\nHow do I create um more visibility and awareness in education so people can actually take proactive steps that will impact the stomach health and that's really the the angle that Philips\nHas um and we're trying to connect the dots between a lot of the solutions that we have for consumers that you use every single day
