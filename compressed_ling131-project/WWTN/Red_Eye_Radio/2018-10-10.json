I I think about yesterday where they said okay we're going to be a little bit of rain and it just poured\nHere so yeah we have in fact we had to some some flooding just based on how to rain right I'm In our area\nSo you think you think of when it's when it's a hurricane and then turn that\nThen you know downgrades to a tropical storm but who really knows in what areas how much rain or you're you're going to get but an extremely extremely a dangerous storm now the update here at uh one am central\nA to a um an eastern time a hurricane Michael now a category for yeah strangely dangerous a hurricane now headed are really the bulls eye right now and I don't believe that has changed at all we'll find out a little bit here when we talk to\nMe the meteorologist John trout but right you know heading towards Panama City\nYeah when you when you when you look back on the ... I guess the history of a major hurricanes or there will be names that that that the rise to the top there is no doubt that based on what we know about Michael already that in the years to come they will look back on on Michael as one of those again historic storms\nBased on the size of it and and the amount of damage has caused a so we'll be following this and we'll talk to meteorologist John trout are later this hour a day and get his take on this and and the latest information that he has\nAnd of course we multitask here on the show on a consistent basis in and one of the things now just a little less than four weeks before election day is after the Kavanaugh hearings you know one\nOf the polls doing and you and I really looking forward to what we're going to see a over the next to a couple of days by the time we get to you know this Friday and we start seeing polls from the actual confirmation a vote and\nCollins speech and and how does that affect certain races out there uh we do have a a a few new polls out there are ... and again it just\nIt we don't we don't believe that there are any absolutes when it comes to polling but it does can give you an idea or at least a snapshot as to what's going on up looking at the Nevada Senate race or a Jacky Rosen the Democrat against a Dean Heller of the ... Republican\nWhere a in of all the previous polls that were done in September a Rosen was up ah early ah one poll done in in the early September [noise] ah she was up by one the grabbed his poll a mid September she was up by two\nAh by the time the CNN poll came and these are all likely voter polls\nAre from nine twenty five to nine twenty nine she was up for ...\nWell the latest NBC News ... poll done\nNine thirty ten three so you're really through all the hearings at that point a again five hundred and Seventy four likely voters or however is now a bite to now all of these really are in the margin of error\nEven when she was in the lead mhm so it's all in the margin of error but if you wish to look at it from one poll to another and again they're sampling\nCan be different but you ... what you see is a a six point swing in that particular race still in the margin of error but still we ... what we're looking for is\nAny type of momentum or any type of\nUh I I think a a change in the polls movement in the polls which could be perceived to be based on the excitement level\nOf people wanting to go out and vote right we're likely voter in these polls would say you know a likely voter we said yeah I'm I'm a likely voter and and I'm fifty percent sure that I'm going to go out and vote this time where it's I'm going out and I'm voting sure and somehow that that ends up changing the the polls removing it\nOr in another uh a direction so uh that one in Nevada you know you and I were looking at other polls of uh other polls are out there um\n[noise] what what's interesting is looking I was looking at the Florida Senate race between Bill Nelson and Rick Scott and if you look at that right now you have a you you've got a couple of the polls are the are seeing the average showing a Nelson\nUp a a to point for but\nIt really has been a if you look at it or just a a really a tie because it's well within the margin of error\nA on a number of polls with the exception of one of the Quinnipiac poll that had Nelson a plus seven but you look at a other polls here a Mason Dixon poll or from nine twenty four to nine twenty seven\nAnd also not by one a W C. T. V. poll\nThat was taken nine Seventeen to nine thirty which would have included a few days after the uh the the the Senate hearing\nUm it would that has Nelson up by one\nAll within the margin of boom way and the margin of error because I'm an air bubbles poses is\nThree and a half yet away and so\nIt it it really is a it really is a dead heat there in Florida\nAnd I think you I think it'll be interesting to watch ah where where the where that goes\nUm I I just think that the the\nPolls between over the next few weeks everything from Kavanaugh the Capitol hearing a and the vote is is going to settle in and we don't know which side it motivates more doesn't motivate the Democrats to get out more to\nTo try and hold the line on the on the Senate race and and ah in in in order to make an attempt to block Trump or down the road for a possible third\nA nominee\nFor ... and so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... down when he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to tend to has done only up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent or are they now they have there are three of a different candidates\nAre in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrat\nIn there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri and uh the uh latest Fox News poll\nNine twenty nine to tend to and\nThat is a dead tied I'll bet is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out ah maybe here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these\nMake your logo the perfect um\nOf promotional items\nWith that one hundred percent guarantee\nFree e magazine will reveal invaluable insights\nGet the latest issue of amplify absolutely free\nTexting go eight eight to eight nine eight eight that's a G O eight eight to eight eight nine eight eight\nVeterans were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life [noise] let them know we can join me as a pro supporter of our veterans Hi this is Joe Montana and on the one hundred anniversary of Veterans Day help no vets alone improve the lives of those who have served our country\nPlease show your support and text V.

hurricane for\nA you know we buy talked about on CNN yesterday and it was it was just a useless conversation about defining the word Martin and and all that but but it does get to the uh you know the whole thing of not being several you know Rand Paul calling Cory Booker machine get up in the face of Congress people and\nRand Paul and his wife remember last week\nA a running a letter and and and state or an op ed piece in state in you know she sleeps with a gun that remember Rand Paul was attacked yep actually in his in his yard by by a neighbor and what they're saying what you know in the ... it's coming out and saying look\nYou know what you're what you're doing you're ratcheting up the rhetoric now of of complete and total instability in the end the beautiful part is ... you know just a a ... a month\nPast the the uh of a funeral John McCain right when they were talking about stability in you and I got this isn't gonna last Hillary decided to get involved in it you're ready for this All right Hillary by the way let us know announced Hillary is back\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house hand or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nLet me ask you this because we we know that the left right now we we we know that [laughter]\n... ... whether it's Ted Cruz being in a restaurant and whether it's Mitch McConnell being at an at an airport the mob mentality that exist now let's get a mob and to intimidate people ...\n\nDo they believe that's going to be effective yes they believe it's working that's my I guess that would be my point to ... to begin with that they believe now Hillary of course when it's well established that the instability and mob mentality now exists then she jumps\nOn board oh yeah yeah I'm going to join join now how many months later\nRight yeah uh and\nShe felt Maxine bought us but I like [laughter] so so this this this again is where we we talk about that they believe\nThat that they believe it's going to be affected either\nThey believe there's one of two things either they believe it's going to be effective\nOr they're just so so enraged they have nothing left some nothing left of substance to offer the people so they just that's the natural I guess outlet is range\nAnd get in people's face wherever\nThey are in their own private time whatever in what they believe that's going to intimidate Republicans or conservatives and\nDidn't really believe that that you really believe are if you're on the lead you honestly believe oh if we do this then there'll be scared and they'll back off right do you really believe that\nThe ... do they believe that it's going to change the supporters of Ted Cruz no oh wait wait wait wait it is\nIt's going to further motivate them it's going to take people who might have decided or maybe just have been sitting on the fence maybe haven't been in Suzie asked about getting out and voting\nI mean conservatives or Republicans it is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually\nA online and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about\nEarly voting you know here's where to find out where early or where the when the early voting starts in your area that means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is\nWhich site is motivated more and historically where is that greater turn up\nThe did you see the NBC reporter who went to the college in California ... and there was like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people ...\nAnd all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting there and the right term not one person raised their hand part finally they found a bench they found one person ... here they found to people that should be our going to vote well what's your concern\nWell you know college and costs to college or\n... what about the rational things on the Russian busted or we don't even know what's going on we don't know tension of that stuff that out I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but\nI I guess the point think about this now because Hillary now coming to board\nAs we said with with everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democrat Party\nSo what are we looking at in terms of a timeline what can the people in the path of hurricane Michael expect from those of first high winds coming in all the way to the I reaching the shore what should we expect and when\nThis really is the calm before the storm I just did a check on the wind speed at Tallahassee, Florida and we're only looking\nAt about Seventeen miles an hour but from here on out throughout the day today\nWe will see those wind speeds increase we could see landfall as a category for we're kinda splitting hairs though I mean we will see wins in excess of one hundred miles an hour we're talking almost a sustained a tornado here folks from the mid west can appreciate the tornadoes and we're talking about\nNot only at tornadic event but a rain event as well and possibly tornadoes spawn from this system over the next say thirty six hours or so\nWhat is the threat of storm surge and where we're will those areas the highest ... be\nLooking at a for the highest be a threat to Mexico Beach Florida to ah Keaton beach nine to Thirteen\nFeet now that's just that wall of water that this wind pushes in couple that with high tide and we know a tides and those areas can range from between three and six feet depending upon where you are on the coast this water will also push a\nInland to Eric and Gary up through rivers and streams and those sloppy areas so we'll see smaller towns inundated we could even see some major highways like I said affected\nNot only from the flooding but the wind event is going to cause no doubt some power lines down power outages a week out\nTo breathe on roadways from a roofs ripped off of homes are talking about a very potentially catastrophic event here\nWhat time do you see it coming onshore\nRight now uh right now we're still looking at the early morning hours today around eight nine AM and\nThat's the actual landfall of they say I but until then from now until then anyone listening to me in\nThat region or you've got to take precautions you've got to save your life and family and heed the warnings from what the officials had been mentioning for the past twenty four hours to get out of the way this thing is a potential killer\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another uh update here in just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\nYeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether it should arrive as a cat three or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on bat when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed we saw from Hurricane Florence or a couple of weeks ago and we saw\nLast year from Hurricane Harvey that the category does not\nMatter as much when we're talking about flooding because\nOnly the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding people things they can't get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah [noise] those floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a John trout we'll be following the story of course and and the storm\nA in a throughout the day and then ah it has its path continues inland and by the way what should we expect that we're still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by Florence\nA little less than whites\nTalked about yesterday I mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but Ah yes those areas locally or to see a some a foot rainfall total amounts into Georgia into the Carolinas North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for\nTornadoes spawn from the system\nAll right Dr John trout neck a job or your time we appreciate it will actually has worked as a so he'll be following this information uh of course a throughout the day but as John mentioned that you need to heed the warnings\nAnd any other directives given by local officials and just keep in mind that the other ... gonna be a number of things that she first responders from getting to you\nAnd so that's the point a and also uh at at some point you could lose power or may not be safe to drink water or from the tap and so there are a number of things that could become\nExtremely problematic and of course uh the uh officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced that people can up and it was just a fifty\nFive minutes ago that the uh the new advisory came out from the national hurricane service on hurricane\nOr a center excuse me on hurricane a well Michael the wanting um central time advisory that it was up to a\nStrength for hurricane and ... a maximum sustained winds now a hundred and thirty miles an hour or so it is a strength for hurricane yeah which is extremely dangerous and will be\nOn on modern records the the biggest hurricane ever to hit if it stays that of or I didn't believe it's the three of maybe the\nThe the biggest ever to hit their the strongest to ever write yeah the pan\nHandle more than ... in terms of the wind and John brings up a great point about those a spin off tornadoes in those areas which can also be destructive as well will follow the story and coming up next our in fact we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale get an update from him\n[noise]\n\n... radio on Westwood One\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's

sustained winds of increased to one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher gusts wins will be destructive when the system makes landfall later today the rainfall will produce massive amounts of flooding there could be tornadoes bond as a result as well a meteorologist\nThen it cuts right across the middle of Georgia and then uh it continues to move or northeast coast of South Carolina\nAnd the eastern half of the eastern southern half of a of North Carolina so they've got a ton of rain there as we all know because of\nA Hurricane Florence but also their coastline could also be affected as are also tropical storm a of a warnings are especially long the the Georgia and South Carolina ... online actually tropical storm warnings there and watches a for a North Carolina so we\nAre right now there quite often you'll see tornadoes uh that that that spin off from storms like this and they can become destructive and they are the ... and they happen\nVery quickly or the knowing and and growing up in tornado alley uh you understand that that they are that that often there's little to no warning for those tornadoes and they become of course a a ... a separate a destructive force\nOf the room so certainly all the folks in the path of hurricane Michael\nOr over the next twenty four to forty eight hours heed the warnings or keep your radios on a keep batteries charged and uh stay alert or coming up here in less than thirty minutes after the bottom of the hour we'll talk with\nMeteorologist Tom hale who did a great job\nAnd covering Hurricane Florence force or we talk to him earlier he also a covered a Hurricane Irma ... in Florida for us uh on red eye radio so we'll talk to him about\nThis a new report the update from the national Hurricane Center which came across at two AM eastern and what changed here and and again what all of this means in terms of the energy behind hurricane Mike [noise]\nUh it uh getting back to what we're talking about a a last hour when we played the audio cut from Hillary Clinton saying civility is impossible until the or\nA Democrats take power again so that was her call for instability and the interesting thing about that as an and we've talked about you know whether it's Ted Cruz or you know in the restaurant that made a big news\nUh uh a couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell are at the uh the the airport or a a Jeff Flake in the the the elevator\nOr what's you know what's going on right now the the call number from Maxine Waters remember when Maxine Waters and she might have been really ignited that that political flame of\nOf actually Democrats to elected office job I was calling it\nA you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints and it's like well most of America looks at it and when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest\nOr organized protest Americans were fine with you go out and you protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots Americans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't uh most Americans don't approve\nOf the fact that you're going into a place that is not your property trespass thing just to the point of harassing right or you know a ... some you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place but that call to harass people at anywhere uh yesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife\nOr has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim with the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation or to the point where unstable people could commit violence\nSaid Paul to Kentucky radio host I fear there's going to be at an assassination why I really worry that someone who's going to be killed and that those who are in a war ratcheting up conversations those who are saying get in their face\nThere have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this this elevates the violence these are people that are unstable poll says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging them the violence that violence is never okay or there's never a reason\nUh to resolve things that weigh directly calling out Booker who last July told activists to get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own uh salt of the hands of a neighbor as well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve skull east was wounded\nTo show that unstable people can easily take things\nAre too far and then we talking about the fact that Hillary talked about you know no civility right share her call here so you've mainstream did completely now with Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability\nNumber one we talked about the fact that\nThey actually think this is an effective way to go to they actually think that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can help civility which is a call for instability mhm which is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd\nI ... that was the first thing that hit me was was they think this is going to be effective but then you get to the point of a Hillary now bringing it up words she feels comfortable saying it looks Hillary's a follower she'll be as she would not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen it before remember when she was up in Canada yeah and she was asked about the pipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president\nIf this is still a a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on it are and she didn't want to take a side right and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability\nAnd and and they think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream in the end and wonder why instability over what what is the issue you're calling for due process you're calling for presumption of innocence you're calling for preponderance of evidence\nYou're saying where's the evidence you're coming out because this is and we've talked about this yesterday what came out of this whole thing ah you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no civility because of it\nWhich is of course that's\nTheir definition it's not the definition of people that believe in due process under the law people to believe and due process under the law obviously are not advocating rape or sexual assault now any other crime right\n\nAnd that's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that is so radical that the writers taking ... instability mislead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case to show the guilt of anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off even the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low\nAlways wonder we always that's the question how long will they go you know calling somebody and not see you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for instability based\nOn people's opinion on the other side that evidence is how you judge somebody's skilled right due process\nShould apply and all of these cases which means you look for\nThe evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race because of their age you believe people because the evidence backs what they what they say now you can believe them you can sit there and why I think it sounded credible\nThat doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called him a rapist because that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and the gang rapists yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes they believe Kavanaugh's it at the evidence isn't there\nRight never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them\nBecause you say no I Believe in the preponderance of uh\nBut as I Believe in the presumption of of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if I Need evidence and when somebody stories change I'm suspicious those are all rational critical thinking commonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now calling for instability\nTo harass you everywhere even invade your privacy where ever you are\nAnd it's not just the ah the old guard and Maxine Waters or he'll know Clinton\nWhat if

hurricane Michael now at a gory for\nYes yes it is category for I agree with you all asleep\nPartner either way [laughter] I said you were working brings I'm awake in fact right now but I was very there's a reason\nThis is what the storms do and uh you know every once in a while you get to be able to capitalize on that adrenalin rush 'em\nBecause you know a meteorologist one of the few things that we get to do and as broadcasters in our lifetime is maybe save a life yeah and and and and here we have an opportunity\nBecause we're being heard from one end of the coast to the other side of the United states [noise] and every one of these people who are listening right now have family and friends or know someone who has family and friends hurt along this coast and and so I'm making the suggestion that you get in touch\nWith your family and friends and make sure that they're doing the right thing [noise] a simple example in Panama City beach [noise] ah there are six possibly now seven shelters that are open so if you've decided to stay along the beach front um and and not move inland\nMaybe a ... you don't have to you can you can move inland to to a little town called fountain up to ... uh two thirty one or or you can take it a little bit further and and had on up to a interstate twenty if you want to go that's only an hour drive up the road that\nInterstate excuse me interstate ten [noise] um the simple thing is that you need to get out of harm's way um\nWhen we talk about a category for storm I Want to put this in perspective and and that and not a slow moving storm like we saw was ... it was a category for storm that hit Puerto Rico last year called Burma\nAnd we've all seen the pictures and the devastation now devastation is relative to what it hits so if it's a rotted tree\nIt it could take a breeze to take that thing out um if the homes are not built to handle hurricanes or they haven't had hurricanes in a long time and the building standards have become lax\nGuess what the same story you get greater amounts of devastation [noise] um here\nThis is something that they have not seen along this coastline historically period um along the\n... of the Panama City beach to Tallahassee Pensacola Beach simply put the panhandle and then the Big Bend area that's the\nArea that swoops around and and and swings down to cedar key uh there hasn't been a category ... storm hit and so that's in itself is\nSomething that nobody can relate to and when you can't relate to something you relate to what your cat\nAnd what you can uh if somebody has been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be caked\nAnd and and and Kate was quite a devastating storm a and at that point you have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well\nAh there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm\nThis storm is an October storm ... he was an October storm and there was a a failure but a failure was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida\nAnd so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening\nOne hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore um tomorrow evening because

expected to produce life threatening storm surge up to Thirteen feet what makes landfall later today you know we're all just Petra drove\nBy seven AM Thursday it will be almost at the Georgia South Carolina border by seven PM Thursday will actually be into the sub uh south eastern part\nOf North Carolina and then by seven pm friday we'll be way out into the Atlantic I mean it really starts moving as it starts crossing the you know the uh the land or after\nHits and then when it uh seems to ah get over water again is just and and that will be colder water it looks like it'll dissipate out there in the north Atlantic somewhere\nRight hurricanes often spawn tornadoes just be aware that that situation is very real and those tornadoes or you have often little to no warning or so again or if you are in the path of Michael and you are not going to get out of the way of that path\nThen make sure that you have all of the central including batteries\nOr for a portable radio or devise a and make sure that everything is charged or so that you can stay up with it and be able to hear any warnings that come across four or something like a tornado or as it was being described by Tom hale\nAre meteorologist found the story and ... again talk with him here in just a bit um but talking with him about the storm surge and the way it is a you know as he described it it's like filling up a bathtub so it is not something again or if you are not\nFamiliar with this with a a storm surge and very few people are\nBased on the the ... diction models for the highest storm surge from this storm very few people on the planet has ever experience that and again we just have to repeat that that is a deadly deadly\nA danger to uh to to individuals well that may not be familiar with it and not a understand fully or what the impact is\nSad and I never lived in in Panama City but at the looks familiar the the downtown city area in which with a lot of residences right next to the water on the bay right and it reminds me of a lot of like Fort Walton Beach when when I Lived outside of Fort Walton Beach where I live actually lived in\nIn Fort Walton Beach for a very short time but mostly in Nevada or Florida which is between Pensacola and in Fort Walton Beach and and that's in my head trying to figure out what it would be like\nYou know when I remember sitting there right in you know residential the\nIn in the city there and you could see the bay and I'm thinking if and that would have been a in Fort Walton Beach I talked to had she may if if that came up you know fourteen feet what that would be like him that's what I'm trying to imagine in my head ... estimates and on and look at Pensacola or look at the uh\nPanama City in and say you're going to have a lot of flooding\nAnd and again uh we we talked about it the the houses on the beaches that are on stilts they're roughly a the four of those houses and the deck roughly at ten feet\nSo if you're talking about a Thirteen or fourteen foot surge that means that inside those above the skills inside those homes you're still talking about three to four feet of water\nA and that becomes the you know I think that puts it in perspective for anyone who's even seen one of those homes and I stayed in one over the summer I Can't imagine water getting that high there's a reason that they build 'em on stilts and that\nThe average is roughly ten feet it's because it's thought to be above the ah average storm surge in and the path of a storm or you know in the average again storm but Michael hurricane Michael is no average storm\nWe'll be talking to meteorologist Tom hale coming up at the bottom of the hour we're trying to get in all the other stories that are out there and they're actually a quite a few stories the the one that caught my attention yesterday because\nUh you we really have gotten a response from the White House on this especially with the president coming out really uh yesterday and and stating and Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay mhm uh you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then the story comes out the two senior FBI officials told\nThe bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious\nWhen he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation\nAnd an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others the comments were either inaccurate reported or made in jest or this is again former FBI general counsel a James Baker more information coming out about his testimony\nAre told congressional investigators behind a closed door deposition last week that then FBI acting director Andrew McCabe an FBI lawyer Lisa Page\nCame to Baker after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and may have twenty Seventeen Baker said page and McCabe relate details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments though he wasn't personally in that meeting Baker told congressional investigators he took McCabe and pages word\nA seriously the sources said further Baker told congressional investigators\nHe suspected that Rosenstein was cooperating with two people in the administration to vote the twenty Fifth Amendment a source said wow yeah the testimony would appear at odds with other accounts of\nThose discussions Baker who's testimony was described as deliberate and sober added he had not done a legal analysis and was not on sure whether it was\nUnethical or illegal the source at it\n[noise] [noise] yeah\nI'm really this is the story that we have talked about the one that is\nHas been completely buried where there's been a really items that somebody may have written it out there but I haven't I haven't even seen at National Review mhm Henry McCarty I haven't seen write about it the Kimberley Process so\nAnd and this is about ... analyzing the the fact that the president with the Pfizer warrant\nApplication that he said let's to classify it\nAnd then came out and said well we're going to give it to the inspector general to look at and he will expedite it quickly and we went for what for what you're you're if you're afraid that\nAre some things should stay ... you know redacted well then you don't go to the inspector general you\nGo ... or a\nSecretary of state former CIA director because what you're claiming some of the allies don't want some of the information out so you go to him or you go to the director of national intelligence you go to the director of the CIA the last ... go to is the inspector general because the inspector general looks at\nWhat corruption oh\nOh they declassified it next thing you know let's go to the inspector general corruption why is does it seem to be that nobody in the media is covering that story everyday I wake up and I said ... what am I missing\nWell because if you look at it there is there's nothing to gain the president's not going to get any kind of I guess political feedback or direction from the inspector general no that's not first of all it's not who Horowitz is\nBut it's not the role of that office ... ... of that position to be an advisor to the president that's not the point\nThe point of the ... office is to investigate misdeeds and wrong doings and possible criminal activity by people within the department of justice ... ... if you look at how that played out and nobody talked about it except\nFor the fact that nobody talked about it\nAnd I'm not talking about the Kimberley straw souls or you know any anybody that has been covering this uh ... even a Sarah a quarter who's been covering an a number of things in and does a really good job at it I'm Talking about the liberal media who's been screaming\nRushing collusion Russian collusion Russia inclusion rush inclusion since before the president took office so it was about that time that they went completely silent on Russian collusion\n... uh Devin Nunes has brought it up like the I don't know why the president doesn't make sense and then he stopped talking about right because nobody is talking about it in Washington none of the politicians Adam ship isn't talking about it nobody is talking about the facts\n\nWestwood One John Kass networks will be radio which done

morning alright what ... what do we know about a hurricane Michael at this point and when we expect another update\nOkay we should expect an update in one hour from now actually we should expect an update and a half an hour abhor yeah mhm yeah and uh and then the second question\nAnd so what is I guess they give us the latest on that uh what do we know about what's the status of Michael right now and when do we expect Michael to hit the shore in the panhandle of Florida\nOkay well the first thing is you know normally the national weather service can be kind of conservative in regards to its own language but the national weather service or the national Hurricane Center in this case\nDescribes Michael as an extremely dangerous category for hurricane life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds\nHeavy rain expected along the northeastern Gulf Coast and it's located a hundred and eighty miles to shout southwest of Panama City and it is one\nIt is a one hundred and Seventy miles to the southwest of Appalachian coal that of course when Spain's or a hundred and thirty miles an hour and it's moving to the north had twelve miles an hour now taking a look at\nThat some of the radar um\nOr indications it's a if you've been watching any of the TV stations with their radar indications that shows a little bit of ... to it [noise] um\nAnd it actually looks like it may be starting to make a little bit of a turn maybe one or two degrees or in the direction of Panama City um and and so it's most likely going to come ashore right in between\nPanama City beach and down to Appalachian coal or a Callaway is a town along their port\nSaint Joe is also along that same areas a category for and this is the official definition of a category for\nA category for hurricanes have sustained winds of a hundred and thirty up to a hundred and fifty six miles an hour obviously Puerto Rico so the higher end of that scale but well built framed homes can will ah sustain severe damage\nAnd loss of most of their roof and and possibly some exterior walls while\nTrees will be snapped or uprooted and power lines down fallen trees and power lines will isolate residents\nAnd power outages will last for potentially a several weeks a and they have in here or possibly months now they're writing it for the worst case scenario here but\nAh several months was Puerto Rico's case um and most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months while\nNow that's the definition of a category four yeah that's a while um\nAnd so you know what can I tell you I'm\nI work for a company that has a group of television stations all around the country a fairly large company called grey TV [laughter] and the company I work for has a TV station that's in Panama

this is your last chance to get out because ah you know you want to you need time to get to higher ground\nAnd frankly are the things can be Ripley replaced the people cannot um and and we understand I I Know that that must be a very difficult to to leave those belongings in your home behind but there is again a every every single source now that we're seeing\nIs telling us how dangerous this storm is heed the warnings and advisories\nAnd directors from those local state officials that are giving you such advice and Tom we're going to get back with you\nHere in less than thirty minutes at the bottom of the hour we'll go further into this and what to expect as you give us our last report before Michael comes ashore in Florida a meteorologist Tom hale are with us this morning Tom we'll talk to you know just a bit looking forward to it All right\nUh and Tom will also be with us tomorrow on the show as we will look at uh the dangers inland as Michael continues the path and a north north easterly direction as all tracks are saying that that's the way that it will turn and go over those\nIt's there in southeast including Georgia the Carolinas or and and so and then back out into the Atlantic later this week but we will hear from Tom here and just a bit after the bottom of the hour\nYou know when you when I started this the the week uh and some of the productions that came out was initially that this might be a category one that would hit right well first it was you know it could be a tropical storm that it was category one than category too then category three\nThan category for an hour up to a hundred and forty miles an hour so we're well into a category of four would still have to increase a significant amount to get to a category five but still an extremely dangerous a a a hurricane and even though\nUh for the pan handle a this in all will would break all the records as we know just down the coast\nOr in the you know the black sea Gulfport area back in Nineteen sixty nine is where when Camille head right and that was a category five when it hit yeah and that did just unprecedented uh uh you know kind of damage but when you think of it and and as Tom explained earlier and sort of John trout\nAre said that you know when when you look at these are called\nMajor hurricanes for a reason one and two are called hurricane when it gets to you know three four and five that's when it moves to major hurricane status because there's a huge difference in wind speeds or Seventy five to eighty miles an hour if you're in a category one to getting up to a hundred and forty\nMiles a hundred and forty plus miles an hour I remember those were sustains wins not does not include the guts and probably you're going to find just a in this of a hundred and fifty miles an hour this is as bad as it any tornado could be well and you had on over and over a bigger ... over a bigger scale\nTo go and as it at it comes to shore ah and on a bigger scale that means that those damaging wins while they may diminish are still going to be damaging the even inland\nAre and and that's the point we're still talking about hurricane force winds well inland\nAfter Michael comes ashore so you you look at the also the\nPotential of and and I think this kind of spells it out if you need a visual in your in your in your mind or you picture a well built home well built structure and you can expect in it in a hundred and forty\nMile an hour wind the roof coming right off of that structure and it may be again one that's built up to code or even greater or that may lose that that roof in a second and again it becomes dangerous\nNot only are the flooding that we've talked about the the ... which would be the rainfall and the storm surge but the debris the flying debris in a storm like this or is extremely dangerous anybody with family or friends\nThat may be in the path of hurricane Michael\nAh reach out to them or make sure that they are doing everything possible\nTo get out of the way of this storm and again we'll talk with Tom hill coming up after the bottom of the hour get caught up on this as he issues his last report for us this morning before\nAh Michael is expected to uh come inland are there in the panhandle and and Big Bend area therefore to near Panama City\nSome time this afternoon between three and six they will narrow that down the closer we get\nBut it is still in that timeframe and as Tom pointed out those dangerous uh wins and and conditions with rain and and storm surge will start to begin the situation will start to deteriorate rapidly\nSometime around noon today in that area some of those stories you want to make sure that\nWe are getting because we do have a lot of hurricane coverage of this hour uh Nikki Haley or resigning a as a un UN ambassador I guess caught a lot of people off guard or you and I talked about how the I I woke up to it as soon as I woke up to it\nAnd then everybody speculating what it might be and everything to the point of on social media she's resigning because she had enough of this administration with Kavanaugh where I was like no I\n[laughter] I don't think there was any indication that that was a the the case and ah you know they uh they they spoke together she was a highly complementary you know you and I have talked about this that you know about Nikki Haley in and others in the administration\nWhen the media comes up to them and says well how was it ... you must disagree with this president at times and she said she will of course I Do but I'm the UN ambassador I I'm I'm not president I don't I don't projected it's like them and create ... it's like when John when John Bolton was asked to national security advisor\nWell or does he does he always do what you say well no because we have different opinions on things and I'm an advisor I gave him his vice right I tell them that that's my role I give them advice doesn't mean he always follows my advice I don't expect him to ... he wants me to analyze the situation and then I give him\nA the advice and once he decides to do something uh I you know I Will support what the administration wants to do because he's the president and she had to do the same thing it's almost as if they're trying to find dissension anywhere well or you're just a great well there isn't any one in that's ever served any president Democrat or Republican\nThat doesn't agree that that doesn't disagree with something that the president is doing right happens all the time it seems so that it's only that they make it a huge case or a big case when it's a Republican and especially when it's when it's Trump but\nUh we'll see uh what her you know future plans are ah she said she has no plans to run for the presidency and twenty twenty we'll see whether she doesn't twenty twenty four and then she could have the motto making America great again again\nYes she could uh seriously if you if the president's served two terms [laughter] what is your slogan if you're a Republican after that I'm Pence it's my turn now [laughter] I don't know it I don't know I'm Sorry it's\nMy turn has already been you all that's right right it was on speaking about her term in in other news and got to go to the miners quickly to get back to the\nHurricane coverage but a Tom Cotton runners I urge to me that Senator Tom cotton believes that it was Chuck Schumer behind Ford's leaked letter Dr Ford's leak the letter he says I Believe Schumer's political operation was behind this from the very beginning\nOr when he was on a huge deal with show ... credit who for 'em or that or the other thing is Rand Paul probably not Cory bookers\nRhetoric insane this rhetoric has got to stop it's coming from the Democrats and coming from mainstream Democrats\nIt's got to stop somebody is going to get killed yeah that that this this tone of of incivility is unacceptable and he brought up the fact that he was attacked and brought out the whole you know skull east\nOf the nation attempt and as you brought up earlier this was an attempt to assassinate just one person no it was an attempt to assassinate members of Congress\nYes it was a multiple uh assassination attempt and that's where again I I Know a lot of people will try and and uh as I say that the Rand Paul is just this is hyperbole and fear mongering\nIt's very real on that day the shooter was out to kill multiple members of Congress\nThere is no doubt there is no debating that\nSo if you look at what has happened since then now where we have main stream the radical behavior the instability in fact the calls for instability coming from\nHillary Clinton Cory Booker Maxine Waters and I don't know anyone on the left who's saying we cannot call from the for this and that we must stop this in fact and that would be\nI don't care who who it is a Chuck Schumer or anyone else they're not stepping up and saying we need to and there's another something enough enough is enough and ... that and that that's why I wanted to bring it up here because as you mentioned Hillary\nAnd she piled on again yesterday in a CNN interview here's part of that you cannot\nOr call one eight six six in full force PI\nIt's hard to be stuck in the car for an hour much less weeks at a time but sadly many family right here in our community called

let's get back with no meteorologist Tom hale who joins us once again\nA Tom a again a reminder of the timeline here when the strong winds uh and and overall the I guess the conditions there are in the path of Michael will start to deteriorate\nWell the fastest deterioration will be at a point that you won't have time to evacuate ... that's going to be anytime from ten o'clock to noon and on\nAs we get into the last four hours of it approaching at that point it's going to probably be fifty miles offshore\nMaybe a little bit further up maybe Seventy five miles offshore assuming it picks up in speed from the Thirteen miles an hour it's traveling right now\n[noise] so what are we going to expect as that I come to the shore what kind of conditions are we looking at\n[noise] um well we're looking at water rising like you're filling a bath tub\nAnd except instead of inches it's going to be rising and feet nine to Thirteen feet weather services estimate is that we'll be looking at nine to Thirteen feet from Kendall Airforce base\nBase to keep the beach um and that pretty much takes you to to the role most uh almost overt\nToward a Fort Walton from Keith in it goes over to Fort Walton that's going to be six to nine feet and the same thing from a from Keith\nIt's the other way to to cedar key or it will be six to nine feet so if you started cedar key and you had on all the way over to as far as Fort Walton Beach you're going to be looking at a minimum of six to nine foot rise and in the heart of this action Pensacola\nOr a Panama City beach and down the Appalachian cola and south of Tallahassee you're looking at possibly nine to Thirteen feet now remember\nWind driven waves on top of that could be additional four or five six whatever feed 'em which will drive it and basically be a battering ram on top of this elevated sea surface as it comes rolling on it that's actually going to happen in the last\nThe rise will take place in the last three hours [noise] but the Windsor already going to be increasing and\nLet me give you an idea tropical storm winds now extend out a hundred and eighty five miles out from the storm that's forty mile an hour winds that if you've ever tried to stand at a forty mile an hour wind you notice it's it's a little bit difficult you know\n[noise] uh and so that extends out a hundred and eighty five miles and Michael is a hundred and forty miles away from Panama City and a hundred and thirty miles away from a Appalachian coal ...\nSo they're already starting to feel these wins and by the time we get the sun up we're going to probably start seeing reports of these wins increasing now initially they'll start is Gus\nThen they will become steady and then from there they'll start rising the water so the first two or three feet of water rice\nUm it is going to start inundating any of the roads that you would have otherwise driven to get out of here right\nSo you know time is of the time is of the essence and uh I share this at the top of the hour and I can't resist sharing it again [noise] um the national weather service uh Tallahassee now mind you\nThese are the professionals who are sitting here taking in all the data\nAnd they are responsible for the safety of the people who are with in their coverage area in Tallahassee\nAnd and that covers the panhandle and the big band and so they put this little
