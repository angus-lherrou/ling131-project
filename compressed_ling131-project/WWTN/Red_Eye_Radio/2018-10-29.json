afternoon federal prosecutors are seeking approval to pursue the death penalty for him responded male Marquez does more about his sister\n\nIt was about under the constitution that we have what should the role the federal government be that's not the debate anymore it has been the debate even up to you know ten Fifteen Twenty years ago\nBut the debate has changed as you just brought up\nRight before the top of the hour the political divide now is we don't believe in America yes we don't believe in the first amendment to the constitution\nAnd\nThis goes to the point of how you sell taking away people's rights we talked about\nMcCain Feingold that really started in the late Nineteen nineties which was we need to get money\nPolitics which was always the dumbest thing in the world Democrats aren't talking about that are they especially with better when Texas now they're in fact they were plotting banjo forgetting\nYou know tens of millions of dollars raised\nRight so taking the money out was dumped ... was was a concept that wasn't going to happen to begin with\nBut it got to the point is you know McCain Feingold we need to limit speech um groups\nGroups shouldn't be advertising because it might be able to influence an election\nWhere there's supposed to be that's where we got to the point of the dumbest slogan ever from the left corporations are people nobody said they were of course corporations aren't people corporation is a set of laws set up by government\nTo regulate business if you're a citizen or a group of citizens\nThat gets involved in that you don't lose your free speech rights and the story that's when I looked at it and said wow it's that's an easy sell because\nYou had McCain that agreed with it\nAnd then you had George W. Bush sign at you and I both have the same opinion back then what do you know it you don't get to dictate who was free speech and who does it oh you are defending the corporations I'm not defending anybody I'm defending free speech either we have\nIt or we don't that to me going back and that's why I say roughly Twenty years ago\nThat to me was the beginning of the push to say that the constitution had it wrong what we've seen our free speech as a as has gone to write [laughter] we we've seen the beginnings of it\nNew York city human or New York city human rights council a you don't use the right gender pronoun or will find you out of business California well yeah OK jailed times in the law or you're not going to actually put him and I'm sure they do it it wasn't going to put it in the law and just going to put it in in in in the law and\nSo we've talked about you know that we talked about the first amendment talked about free speech the left does not believe in free speech they don't believe in freedom of religion we've talked about the different you know a Baker cases forced cases\nAre out there and as most people in America believe walk don't you want to do behind closed doors but I don't care what you want to do with your life don't force me to believe it now the ... once you wants to force you to do it\nRemember when Obama became president oh no no no come on I mean Obama Care\nNow this is going to be fine no we're not going to force\nOr anybody who is religious to do anything against a what they wish to what to do oh contraception contraceptives yeah we're going to force you to do this\nWe knew it all along so you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone they believe is antiquated\nAnd as we as seen now and this comes from the identity politics\n... created and nurtured by the Democrat Party are there to the point now of as we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed\nDue process doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation everybody knows that's total garbage every case is on the evidence if you came out and said you believe now there should be a presumption of\nInnocence and we should have due process\nYou were called every name in the book you were called a gang rape enabler and that's where the political divide is in this country then we'd go even further with the election of Trump and the ... and and what happened with cabinet\nThat now the leftist promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this and it's and it's spreading now go to social media and see how many people on the left are picking it up\nWell you know yeah the electro college is wrong and now so is the Senate the Senate is wrong we shouldn't have it set it anymore and we shouldn't have the electro college\nWhich again to me there's no compromise on those issues why because I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about\nWe've often talked about the ignorance of the people in this country especially on the left when it comes to understanding the constitution which they don't even wanna seemed\nTo understand what so ever but we live in a constitutional republic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority it was so individual rights could be protected but the majority could not rural your constitutional rights\nInvalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic they don't care\nAnd so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to everybody or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is Ben we don't believe in the United states we don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due process\nUnder the law we only care about what we want and however we attain it\nIncluding tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the power to do so where's the compromise if you sit in our states where's the compromise on that well there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide\nAnd it's going to be fierce and it's going to be passionate well\nAnd that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is [noise] uh the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items this is why you seen the Republican Party has been jailed especially since the Kavanaugh thing\nBut I think the the Kavanaugh thing was was not just about the cabinet process or the lack of respect for the process\nI think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle I think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nYou and I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all of that after it happened we were like I said wow who knew Lindsey Graham huh but you have Lindsey Graham actually say during that are passionate speech talking about the process\nDuring sort of my or and the land of Kagan's\nConfirmation\nThan what the discussion was about but I think for a lot of them they live inside the bubble they don't see it as we see it every single day they follow the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they hear things and they see things but now\nThey were people were getting in their face\n\nNow it had come to their table right there on the committee or if they\nStart with the Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport they saw it with with Ted Cruz\nAnd it wasn't just protester groups that kind of behavior had reached the Senate chambers and I think it was an eye opener for them\nTo put it on perspective and say well yeah of course it was bound to reach our table it was bound to get here ultimately and it has\nAnd that was the real threat because\nForget about the the the the protesters\nAnd and and all of those who are shouting at the faces of people\nYou've had the endorsement of that behavior since Maxine Waters and even before that of others saying it's OK er Don Lemon saying oh it's it comes with the territory you should expect this but then they go further no we need more of this\nWhich is building a

and\nAnd it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with\nA we're not the first ones to live the political divide in this country and we won't be the last the only difference in the political divide now is it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it\nBased on the fact that we as a nation need to provide more to the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution but now it's a belief on the left\nThat the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority don't matter anymore and so you know we we've talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration\nOr into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary cities mhm and I do believe that the Republicans are\nFailed miserably to capitalize on this because yeah science when you think about sanctuary cities is the belief that in a legal immigrant criminal\n\nAnd their freedom is more important than the rights and\nSecurity of American citizens that's the point that isn't brought up enough what you hear is sanctuary cities well we need to protect\nThese people ... what are you doing you're not protecting just illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal that's at by the way that's actually why it's news\nYeah\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the\n... you I think the the situation in California\nWhere you had a city's come out and and go after the state for centuries state policy and the the concerns that were issued at those all of those events surrounding that and it's still going on it'll be ... that will be an interesting legal battle by the way\nUh to watch in the coming years um but that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are you're counting or your state leaders\nSaying we're not here to protect you I mean that goes beyond think about the empty political but the political process the promises over the years we're going to be tough on crime we're really going to work\nTo improve things that some people actually were able to get it done but those empty political promises people usually scoff at\nThis is quite the opposite it's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government\nThat says we are not here to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the safety interests of someone who doesn't belong here\nWho was not a citizen\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate has because many people are falling into it the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet let's analyze the back and forth who had the worst insult who made who who who made a the\nThe social media statement that could be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violent and even if they were kidding around and we're like\nLet's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about what is the substance of the political divide right and I believe from my point of view\nThat's that's what I fear\nI fear a loss of liberty I fear a loss of the protection of the uh minorities in this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy\nAnd that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of\nOf of ah the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of war but left wishes to do when you see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\nImagining a better bank starts with looking at the savings rates most banks offer and saying\nReally capital one is building something better

view he has to be to hear how we ... started up\nBlack ... ... yeah [laughter]\nAh you had the the group of a of a black Trump supporters last week hundreds of the meat ... now I don't know I don't know whether he's got it you know whether the in the midterms\nYou'll get a couple more percentage of blacks black still overwhelmingly vote for Democrats we all know that but the fact is imagery the imagery and it's growing each and every day whether it's Kanye West coming out or\nOr some of the biggest conservatives supporters right now and Trump supporters in this country are blacks it may not be a world going to change at the moment but the fact is they're getting media coverage\nAnd the more that comes out ... the the more blacks to stand up and say I like Trump and I don't believe he is a racist\nThey can't add that on the left that is not permissible you and I've always said on um you know Trump or racist\nHow many years has anybody ever have an allegation of him being a racist in business ever know anybody who's ever\nWorked for him personally you know you saw a number of people that were in fact he was at a resort when he was\nCampaigning twenty sixteen and you had people that stood up\nYou know from all ethnic backgrounds that said he's critic boss to work for no they they praised him until he became a threat in ... until he started working you know for things\nHow many how many and see a a A N double ACP awards did he went right\nNow he was praised across the board the liberal left love Donald Trump\nUp until the time he decided to run for president and promote things like tightening the border lowering taxes yeah no they loved him but he was well and still is\nOn most everything that he's done these well within the mainstream of American politics as you pointed out many times\nBut that doesn't that doesn't matter no he's an extremist and we must label them as such this will be the tactic for\nYou know and has been the tactic by the left or for many years on presidential candidates but it's going to be the ... it's the tactic by the left on on pretty much everything now\nAnd we address this last week I don't like a lot of Trump's rhetoric and I don't think it's needed I don't think it's needed to win but I Know is part of his personality I hate to say it but as ... as\nThe great conservative political pundit shots he said ...\nRemember during the campaign or was it after the campaign and it was after the campaign loves messing with people's heads yeah we're from queens we messed with people right\nNow I don't like it because I think that on so many issues he has no win and he doesn't have to get personal well in my in ... in a in a lot of the rhetoric right order\nIn order to get the when we've talked about this in great depth last week got some complaints on it that's fine [laughter] welcome to talk radio but it's not needed mhm the instant satisfaction of somebody on their side was mean so you can be mean back and you get that instant enjoyment stop but we don't need it\nEspecially with the wins that this president is getting that the other Republicans haven't been able to get or weren't willing to take on in years right\nLet the wins do the talk\nBut I understand but I've come to realization of of who he is\nBy the way I did see some I did uh some of the social media are posted well you can't no longer look at them and said that the rhetoric has acceptable because he has good policy\nWell no\nActually you can and you can also say for all of his rhetoric um [noise] look at the opposition ... look what the choice was\nWhat was the choice mhm the angel Hillary yeah\nMy name's ... death ... was it like I said it's [laughter] about that that rhetoric [laughter] like the grim reaper [laughter]\nBy the way she said she would like or to be president but she isn't going to run in two years on I saw that headline over the week yeah\nMainly because she knows that the the left is going to call her outlook they're done with her they're done with the establishment left or whatever you want to call it\nKnown on\nHow much else it won't be long before possibly but it won't be long before they're done with a Casio Cortez and O'Rourke\nWith a war it's going to be November seventh button [laughter] another said might be a little bit longer but it's but this is they did this in Georgia six remember\nYou know the the race there oh he's the next he's the face of the party okay for any of your Democrats without Googling ... tell me who he\nWas\nThey don't ... because that's that's they move on\nThey're done with you a tomorrow because you're going to be the oppressor tomorrow\nWell I got to be what's wrong with high the nation to I did hear and he's a I heard him say no but I did I hear he was asked that question even when he loses taxes you know you run for president right in twenty twenty so overworked may still be around for a little bit yeah we'll see\nYou know\nRun for president ... uh who else who who else is there did did a war and kill her chances yeah she's either way I what does it what did the DNA places\nI don't know whether they did this after that whole controversy but I keep seeing people who say I you know went to you know what's\nMy DNA dot com whatever and a son and my sample got it back and I'm Nineteen percent Native American mhm there's two different commercials I've seen where they're Native American I'm thinking to myself it's just a coincidence\nYeah\nJust a total coincidence or do they make the ads after Elizabeth Warren my\nUh my wife and I both did ours and mine

do\nSo the euro centric theme of the show tomorrow will be well\nIt's you know here's the thing is that um I I think that ultimately the the left is going to ask her you know whatever happens\nA week

I just happened to be doing this today because it's supposed to be in the like eighty today in eighty\nTomorrow and then it's gone so I'm pretending this is like a long weekend and I just happened to come in here and want to chat with you mhm I wanted to bring in some alcohol to pretend I was staying out real late in the morning and mhm right so I took a long bike ride yesterday Fifteen mile bike ride and I did it all throughout my huge subdivision that I live in ...\nAnd as I was driving around 'em or will probably knows I'm riding around\nI'm looking for one crew sign one because I told you the other day I I didn't think I saw once why specifically\nWhen Fifteen miles around I live in a subdivision that probably has about three thousand thirty five hundred homes I think it is relatively new uh uh south south a ... a south west to Dallas a twenty five miles south west Dallas\nOr right before you get to farmland is where I live you know there's like subdivision\nFarmland mhm but the big subdivision or probably about two or three every block I Would go down every street two or three sides didn't see one crew sign in Fifteen miles driving through my subdivision\nAnd you and I asked the question is that even an effective way to spend your campaign dollars mhm [noise] yeah I see\nA number of them are of ... in my neighborhood uh there's there's a few but there's just as many Ted Cruz signs right now and yards and my neighbor yeah\nNah ... couldn't couldn't find one yeah and and but I'm driving it I'm going down\nThere I Would love to talk to these people ... like if they were sitting out there and drive wages pay how ya doin' bullet my bike oh yeah riding a bike and then look at it uh even ...\nEven even if I had to not to be honest and tell [laughter] well and as it is and not just a volunteer information just go oh so you are voting for better why over Cruz no that that's exactly the way I Would like to approach it especially at the polls just\nHave like a ... just a roundtable discussion of people that are voting or just cast their vote a okay you know what do you think as you just cast your vote so it would be you'd say what are you thinking not get get yeah so you're exactly okay what do you like\nWhat is it that is you know because it is it different in every low college it's different in every precinct or it's different you know state to state or we do have\nYou know Democrats that that when I mean Beto has won his district I mean and and can if he wants to serve in the house he can he can stay in that district I think for a long long time if he wants to\n[noise] um but there are you know\nAgain as you as you kind of why now through the state I'm just curious as to what the the average everyday person is thinking because clearly they're active voters so there's there's that\nUm is it a routine kind of thing it almost as routine for me but I take it very seriously and it is a very thoughtful process because I Do take it seriously\nYeah but routine there's nothing wrong with routine of interest party ... is part of the culture that you grew up and vote right but I Wonder are there are some that that have a routine\nAnd it's just based on you know this is the ideology and and this is it and it's not or not even a ideology there's just no way I can vote for the other side I mean there's a number of questions that I Would have\nAnd I would sit it would probably take hours to sit around just a just a regular\nYou know to think of Frank lunch and the stuff that he's done you know Fox News or the years I like Frank but I always think he asked the wrong questions you know why he doesn't ask the questions I Would ask you exactly [laughter] and and and I think in that setting\nToo I mean these are these are people that I I Know just devoted these are people that are active especially if you were to do it like in an early voting setting mhm you know it that that are active early and it's going to I Know what's going to be on both sides um I Would love to see what is it that's driving you\nAnd we'll we'll see some of that I think you know after a while a week from Wednesday we'll we'll learn what some of that was here's a question I Would ask in Texas\nNobody is even talked about the governor's race yeah there's really not a race they can talk about [laughter] at all because Greg Abbott has a roughly ... point lead yeah over loop evolved as the Democrat yeah frack a former sheriff of ...\nAnd ... that's not even close you you don't hear anything about that so here's a question that I Would ask this is a very interesting question you have probably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more\nThat are voting for Greg Abbott but will not vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who will vote for better over why\nWould be my question mhm right because there's such a\n\nFriend is a ...

now in ah in Brazil and other news want to make sure we get this uh to cause a we had this happen after friday the U.S economy grew\nAt three point five percent pace and the third quarter a model was expected a little bit over the three point four percent that was being talked about the department said the uh price index the PC price index\nA key measure of inflation increase by one point six percent last quarter much less than a to point two percent increase expected by economists so that's ... that's good news yeah yeah there's a consumer's expending which accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity grew by four percent in the third quarter\nOf the strongest says the fourth quarter of twenty\nFourteen [noise] yeah um that's ah again encouraging news or we want to we we hope to keep that going but certainly good ... going into the the mid term a week from tomorrow\nAh these ... watts\nThan expected the overall expansion was slower pace and the growth in the in the previous quarter gross domestic product grew by four point two percent and the second quarter\nMember they up that one tenth right yeah I was ready for front one percent of that to a four point to look nobody thought I'd look even even if the tariffs didn't go into place a ... and the majority of terrorists have not taken place yet\nUh I I and they went in what September twenty eight so really wasn't included in in in that quarter but still a about what I Would expect it look if you can get anything close to just three percent growth\nSince April twenty Seventeen and we brought this up before you have to point nine percent growth yes half of that increase in growth was because of government spending but half of that was also because of what the economy was doing\nRight so what the private sector economy was was doing so all in all uh\nAnd maybe it's because I have lived so long under\n[noise]\nMore socialist thinking presidents [laughter] ... yeah [laughter] I I'm a I

rally the troops and try and keep it go\n[laughter]\nThat was some interesting rally the troops yeah no I think it's yeah I I because I we've we've called on the Republicans how many times to point out the good for now it's a good point out the positive and that's how you do that uh that's that's one those are the these are the numbers you use\n\nA Hillary I'd like to be president doesn't planning on running but would still like to be president\nShe doesn't want to ... what she's saying is if we didn't have all that you know election stuff we had to go through then yeah I mean you know if you guys just want to make the president\n[laughter] it's my time again yeah a third time again\nRight uh yeah it's hurt time no seriously no no no no no no ... well yeah we don't yet know but but seriously that's going to be the sign\n\nA Texas representative better or work says he would he wouldn't concede being down in the polls even though the latest survey show him falling further behind Senator Ted Cruz a Republican and companies trying to unseat\nA this from the Washington Examiner he was asked about his poll numbers point blank during an interview Sunday with W F a a local or ABC affiliate here in Dallas closing in the final days public polls have you down how do you make that up now he was asked I don't know I wouldn't concede that were down\nBut we just pointed out that you are\nNow that we're Ted Cruz saying that if he were if Ted Cruz were down well item concede that were down\nWell that's I mean that's the answer you always ... mhm so well\nYou don't ... here's the thing you don't ignore the polls that's just all out ignoring the polls are what you do is I knew you say look we're don't count us out until\nElection ... and you know what the polls who believes the polls right [laughter] and you know why you say that because everybody on your side will agree with you yes whenever you're down in the polls everybody on your side agrees that the polls were wrong\nBut what about election night well you can see that approves wins you're going back to the Trump question\nWill if cruise wins will the wind be legitimate exactly we believe\nThat Russians and or Canadians and or the or anyone else might have interfered with the election\nWhat ... they got in a Rolex\nYet uh the the I think the I\n... it will be interesting to see the I guess the the number of seats that that they gain if they gain seats in the Senate and where the house shapes up because you do see some movement right now and some of those polls\nAnd not by the way the Republicans picked up one over the weekend according to our sci fi yeah they he okay a couple of things they had lost one on friday\nRight so they went back down to one Ninety nine and then they gain to back over the weekend so that leaves the essentially the top ... somewhere around what twenty nine right\nSo you you know you look back at the you know in the the pollsters aren't as active in the house races that just aren't\nThere some that you can find polls on but others you have to go back week's\nPre Kavanaugh pre caravan pre well pre heart of the election season and you can't find and there's nothing\nAnd so you you have to wonder what is because the sentiment does change we talked about this a number of times on the program how you could say well that was so yesterday and I'm and we literally mean yesterday not like years ago\nBut in ... in in terms of the public sentiment it it changes drastically can change can change drastically very quickly\nAnd that's why I think the polls are important there are a number of things that could impact the race in any given house seat or house race and I think that's what you have to wonder is if any of this is impacting some of those toss ups a cabin all the caravan or or anything else\nOr looking at the Missouri Senate race or from the twenty fourth and twenty fifth the Missouri scout Holly up by for I don't know if that's you know a been impacted by the crazy Democrat ed yeah\nRight oh I'm Sorry I still can't get over that and still the yeah she [laughter]\n[laughter] I I Wonder if that's unprecedented for US Senate race it might not be for a house race\n\nBut I Wonder yeah you can find in case you don't know we're talking about\nA Claire McCaskill the Democrat in ... put together an ad we played friday a bunch of different times where she didn't practice civility at all with their own party ... where in in the ad you had to mend talking back and forth and they said Claire isn't one of those crazy Democrat\nAnd you know that's her saying it was her at it wasn't a pack you add it was her at ... she put it together was it an outside group she approved of it so what she's stadium is I'm not one of those crazy Democrats and we were over the weekend in fact I had a couple of conversations with a couple of people political people that I Know and I said you know of any other case\nSenate race where anybody actually said that about their own party nobody could remember one\nWe didn't want to try the house because well again we we did know there's so many house races hope though you know every every single or every couple of years and so we we just said maybe in a house race there could have been one time because there's so many house races out right yeah\nWhat an ad in the interests of the word crazy rate was ... yes because it certainly positioning of of of of any candidates\nWhile I'm more of a moderate I'd I'm not far right or I'm not far left or whatever\nBut that's not what that was that was crazy Democrat there was for a reason it was a very clear and direct physician and I think too it was a\n... [noise]\nI I don't know if it was a Hail Mary I Would love to be a fly on the wall but certainly it was one of those\nUh attempts that was going to be direct and was going to be blunt and we're talking about just weeks before the election this ad is out there and it was heading for reasons I mean that race is extremely tight but there had to be a connection\nWith people essentially that were saying that likely in the ... research that's what was going on their internal showed that people were using those that term specifically\nReally capital one is building something better you can open a capital one savings account with one of the nation's best savings rate from anywhere like here for here\nOne of the nation's best savings rates opened on line at a capital one location or from anywhere that's banking reimagining what's in your wallet for consumers only offered by capital one and a member of the icy copyright twenty eight and capital one\nMessage and everything like please not acted dry ever wonder why Europeans seem to speak so many languages maybe it's because they used battle the number one selling language learning gap in Europe battles award winning technology gets you speaking right away whether you're learning Spanish French or German and basketball you'll remember what you've learned\nI always thought I was bad and languages but after using the apple I can tell you I was just taught the wrong way\nUsing battles ten to Fifteen minute lessons you can be speaking confidently in your new language within weeks\nI was amazed that I could start having real life conversation right away because it's so fast now I'm speaking Spanish\nNo wonder battle is the number one selling language learning gap in Europe try it for yourself and see my battle is the quick way to get conversational in a new language like Spanish French were more you can try battle for free download the app or text book job\nTo forty eight forty eight forty eight taxi cab to forty eight forty eight forty eight to try battle for free that the O.
