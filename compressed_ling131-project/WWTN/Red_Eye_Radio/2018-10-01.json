let her do that for a car exploded in downtown Allentown, Pennsylvania or Saturday Night and now look with already sort of treating them so that was a homicide and one town police chief Tony I'm sleeping\nOr and I went to check the other day after the controversy came out that he did the hit piece job\nAnd USA Today I'm Brett Kavanaugh uh and when I went to check his Facebook page it's gone uh he wrote an article called is Brett Kavanaugh right that he can no longer coach girls basketball I have\nThe original uh the original tweet and the original article here and I just thought it's important to to let people know that I knew him and you do any story let people know that\nYour relationship to the subject of a of a particular story ... but he wrote Brett Kavanaugh testify the other day that he might never coach girls basketball again he shouldn't at least not until further investigation has concluded\n\nAnd he goes on to talk about Kavanaugh said he loves coaching and everything else and then he talks to of of the ... the so called the ... uh uh experts are talked about how Kevin O's you're free to continue coaching in the Catholic youth organization and there's\nPrivate schools or talked to a spokesperson from the\nArchdiocese of Washington he started coach accused of sexual misconduct would have to go through the full legal process and be convicted before being banned\nTalked to other people that you know a a you know the the talked about he showed a hurry shouldn't ah and then he kept asking the question but surely but surely but should he and he ended it by saying this and this is ... this is not a quote from somebody else\nThis is Eric writing at least on line that I have from the are tied story\nQuote the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything anymore but credibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that end up in a boat\n\nAnd the tweet a that led to promote the article said the U.S Senate may yet confirmed cabinet under the Supreme Court but he should stay off the basketball courts for now when kids are around writes Eric Brady\n\nAbsolute piece of\nCrap hit job on Kavanaugh's what it was now USA Today came in and this was just it was written as a sport article\nThey deleted the tweet and\nApparently made him change\nTo all the lines the lines that are no longer in the newer article\nIs this part isn't it works is Brett Kavanaugh touched by the other day that he might never coach girls basketball again then this line was eliminated he shouldn't at least not until further investigation has concluded and the other line that then was eliminated\nWas the nation is deeply divided sometimes it feels like we don't agree on anything but credibly accused sex offenders should not oh shoot basketball girls\nOr boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that that was eliminated when USA Today took down the one story deleted the tweet and put out a new story not in the regular sports section but in the opinionated sports section\nDoesn't matter whether you asked the question\nIt's a hit piece which are trying to portray is that you suspect him as a pedophile\nAnd\nIt got me a little bit because I'd rather it for Thirty years I like I said no one when I was a teenager\n\nAnd I and I look at this and and I ... over the last you know year or so I Will admit that I could see in some of his personal post\nYou know you could you could tell he didn't like Trump but that's okay I mean come on I got friends who do that but they were friends who do that all the time we never ever got into a political conversation ever on Facebook right\nAh but I did see that you could tell that the you know that that it was in there it was in there somewhere but that's that's fine because people have their political opinions\nAnd I'm fine with that we've all got our family members and friends that disagree with some politics all the time and again I haven't seen or what it since we were teenagers so I I you know I don't know but like I said um\nI always thought that he wrote with class this is completely classless article\nA it's a hit job it's unwarranted\nA it is not up at all\nTo the sports journalistic standards but I knew from Arab Brady\nWhen\nHe started writing as a local writer and then went with USA Today probably for the first you know for for the last you know Thirty years this was just an absolute hippies and and what gets me angry about this era you know you and I've done talk radio for a long long time and sometimes we may get a little bit of overheated whatever but\nWe never really get we've never really gotten ourselves in any trouble where we've had to apologize for anything that we sat on the air you know where management comes and you must apologized because the sponsors are all Bailey and that's because number one we don't think I you and I don't think in a kind of radical ways to begin with\nWe're not hateful people we don't hate anybody\nBut I've always said if somebody says on the radio and loses that for a little bit to me that's a little bit more understanding even if you tweet it out\nAnd it's just a sentence but white here what he did he wrote an article this was absolutely premeditated it was a premeditated hit job apparently because of the range that he feels of anything that's relating to Trump\nWell and this is you know the indicative of the ... the mentality on the left this is just one more in a long line of people that are now just throwing everything at the Capitol nomination because they have room to do\nAnd you know how you know is wrong and now he knows he's wrong\nBecause the editors or somebody got involved and said this goes to the opinion section you got to take out these sentences because these aren't fact based at all because he called it a credible accusation ... that's a political statement that is not a statement of fact\nNo\nAnd the the the fact that the u._s._a. today had to delete the tweet oh and then he deleted his Facebook page completely he deleted for a reason\n\nBecause he knew the blowback that was coming why because what he wrote was an absolute ... piece on a man where there is zero evidence except for the allegation that he's ever done anything wrong well again\nThey you know for them now the claim is reality\n\nAnd so this goes to not just the hippies but a hit piece on his family\n\nNot he's not capable of making unbiased decisions not we're against him because he might overturn roe v Wade\nNot anything else\nIt was a hit job directed toward his children\nIt involves the activities of his children ...\nImagine had somebody done this with Iraq Obama and his daughter oh that person would be unemployed by now that person would be done if they were especially if they were working for a major news organization like USA Today\nThat ... that would have been over\n\nAnd and but this is what the left sees as a win this is what they see as acceptable\nTactics and it will continue now\nThanks to Jeff Flake and it's not acceptable in our nose Ryder air Henry I about a dozen terrified and I'm sure Eric breeding knows it just so somebody just rooms of the conversation they don't think I'm referring to you [laughter]\nAnd they don't care they don't care so that it's unacceptable because it's acceptable to them because anything to stop Trump and anything to stop this nomination process\n\nJust reprehensible what he did in USA Today and that and they wonder and then they gas that Kavanaugh was passionately defending himself yeah\nExactly\nYeah you're a bunch of hypocrites you know it you're

I'm keeping up to date on this every single week just because I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe that my prediction we don't make many predictions but most of my predictions\nMay come to fruition and that is where I said months ago I said I think I Know what's gonna happen here with a whole NFL kneeling thing I think it's going to be basically don't ask don't tell\nWhere they the players association really encourages of players not to do it or stay in the locker room or do whatever and have the thing just slowly fade away because contract talks\nWill well I mean the contracts up what in\nA almost two and a half years now but they'll start negotiating ended a good year out so you're a year and a half away really year and a half year on three quarters way from\nThe the contract negotiations probably starting and they want to make sure that TV ratings are going up and not sliding down because they sign a ten year deal so we believe that the NFL players association has probably gone to the players and the reps in say encourage your people not to Neal\nWow weeks for Bengals the falcons all players stood buccaneers it bears all players stood lions and cowboys all players stood bills in Packers\nAll players stood the bills kneeled as soon as the game began though those versus titans only Michael Bennet\nThe NFL player Who Lied to the police about the Las Vegas police or lied about ... light about the Las Vegas police\nAh was in the locker room Texas Texas versus colds all players stood it's only the dolphins only the dolphins ...\nA wide receiver Kenny Stills all but Wilson kneeled during the anthem defensive ed Robin Quinn racist fist all of the players to for the national anthem jets jaguars all players stood Brown's raiders all players stood Seahawks versus cardinals three players were in the locker room for the national anthem so you just have the dolphins are it that's all that's left\n...\nAnd that's all you have had ... after they're gone and that sort of fades away now that it's down really to one game 'cause nobody notices if you're not no no cameras can be on you if you're in the locker room\nBut you've got four players in the locker room and three players on one team standing that's what you're down to now and I do believe it's they just they just wanted to fade away they don't want any official announcement it's just slowly going to fade away\nAnd and ah it'll be something that will be a footnote none of fell history yeah but I don't think because you don't hear they've been discussing this for three months four months mhm not you haven't heard anything about or the ongoing him worthy I'm going negotiations going on between ...\nAnd F a NFL players association and the and the owners here I thought they were doing negotiations it shouldn't take long after you stand or you don't\nWell that has no way to draw heartland in the sense no so you just let it go away and you encourage the players not to do it and finally money winds over\nYeah\nYeah that's right it's um I don't watch the show but I saw the story on a ... I think it was news busters that have the story on the show bowlers on HBO\nUm\nI think the rock is in that I think he plays an agent or something but they were talking about the whole Catholic thing and the people who objected to capture Nick kneeling and everything else and they use some of course it's HBO so they use some language blank them\nAnd uh\nIn the end the dialogue and I thought to myself why is that the story\nEven for news busters I mean I Know news busters typically they're promoting the or they're reporting on the media yes you know if it were is CNN saying that or ESPN which I'm sure they\nWill blame them it was a cabinet gr blank the people that are blindsided people who objected to call you a okay\nAll right I like what Eric I I've said this before though\nWhen every single person when they say you're not watching ... ... why not explained to them why mhm they go\nOh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that\nEvery single person that I've talked and this probably fifty over the last that you know it's been over a year they said well I think it's a free speech issue or actually visited free speech you know what they did ... because of you know here's what it's about and here's what I object to when I\nTell them they go oh I get it okay I guess I didn't know that I didn't know that I didn't know that\nWe live in an ignorant nation let's be honest the majority of people on the majority of topics are completely ignorant not our audience well they make a choice of majority are yeah they they make a choice to stay out of it and then jump right in the middle of it right up knowing they don't know they don't even know what's going on mhm we talked about this on economic issues\nWe talked about it when it comes to understanding how government works the vast majority of people and we're talking over two thirds of people can't tell you\nThe three branches of government they have no idea I don't even know why we live in our society and why we talked about it and why we talk about American exceptionalism they have no idea why as I said before I understand why these people come out now and say America is an exceptional\nHave no idea how it works ... ... ...\n\nBut I heard somebody else say they don't like it so they don't like it either\nBut yes where that's where we live right now it's on it's unfortunate that in the day in age and think about it I just I go back to when I was in high school and\nCollege and how you have to search for information remember going to go you want to have a question you'd go to the library it it could take you it's a you know I really need to find out about this let me go to the library okay I have to get in the car drive to the library ...\nYeah you're where you're very limited right find find the right book bears the book open the book do and that's not the right to go to a different bugs you've got ten bucks in front of you just to find out one thing you know I mean\nLook at the difference in the way the media runs everybody complains about the media controls everything actually they don't these days imagine back in the day that you went to a newspaper stand right or one of the machines All right so you had a newspaper machine\nAnd you put your quarter and and you grab the only one only one grab the only one because you don't grab to matter how many coupons you need\nAnd imagine at that next to that same newspaper machine were Fifteen to twenty two hundred other machines fact checking what was in that MORNING EDITION of that newspaper\nThat's what you have today yeah\nYou can the Washington Post can come out and they can put their story out or CNN\nWell and and and that's the thing we've talked to him give us some of the media controls go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa one thing we we tend to you with age as we know how it used to be back then ... and not only are there more news sources out there\nBut you just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there\nBut you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on\nIs greater than it's ever been before we were growing up and they could say whatever they want and if you wanted to research it it would take serious time to do the research to actually know what was going on yet\nWe say that people are actually more informed back then they are today or because they did the basics first they actually learned and paid attention to and knew the basic ideas on which this country was founded\nWell they were taught to base and now you don't have any of that so what do you have\nPeople thinking I guess they don't have to learn it because they can Google it if they need it well they're not even willing to do that but when you know the basics of how government works or how ... works\nThen you can have the debate on the ideas regardless of who's reporting what regardless of who takes what position you can have the debate on the ideas because it's not about the people it's always been about the ideas and the one idea that this country\nTax fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.

the protocol of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd she kept it secret I mean that is so against the protocol of what you do in the Senate Judiciary committee that he was livid\nAnd the fact that\nThere is a

Jake Tapper asking the panel yeah ah that at you know the same row it's clear now that the Democrats somebody ah in that party leak right and there and and the response was somewhat\nRight and\nAnd so you you know they did it and so Lindsey Graham being on the Judiciary Committee mean to then that's in theory aiding because it's something that I Know Lindsey Graham has never done ... and there's a certain protocol that you're supposed to do understanding what's your role as a senator is\nLindsey Graham may be at times are part of what\nWas used to be recalled the swamp ... but as we know the swamp as involved in Washington DC uh especially when Republicans look at it are Trump supporters look at it or even from looks at you know what the swamp is\nAnd\nThat's I think one of the other reasons that Lindsey Graham wishes so infuriated ... and why he led off at that at that point\nIs that you know you you think about it remember first it was an immediate knowing he should be disqualified he's not qualified for this whatsoever secondly they handed an allegation an extremely serious allegation\nFrom the Senate Judiciary committee she got word of it she's the ranking member mhm\nShe's supposed to bring it to the Senate Judiciary committee or tell the woman look or I can bring the says to the district committee but your name's eventually going to become known we keep it secret for a while but I Need to bring it to the ... committee and then we'll have the FBI do we keep your name out of it until then but at some point if you wish to continue\nThen\nYou know we can keep it anonymous and the and the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue then your name will become well known she didn't do that you know\n\nAnd so everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector uh the the suggestion of a law firm everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\nAnd\nYou know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind ... as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that now\nWell it's like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole ... thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nIf you're driving right now and you'd like to read the informative an entertaining content found in the current September October issue of rotating magazine or if you'd like to listen that's right I said listen\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to do well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of votes your drivers is now available for free as an F.

and again that that that could change because there's always fluctuations but July was the highest and five months and earlier this year I forgot which month there was January February was huge\nA but one of the problems is a a civilian aircraft uh in in July and uh also the uh uh soybeans soybeans was huge and we're not going to be able to make that up with Europe\nAnd as we know the terrorists went into effect a and you have many financial publication St ... OK here comes because the Chinese tariffs have gone into effect\nThe president knew that he had the administration knew they had until midnight mhm in order to get the deal or possibly past uh you know for example in Mexico you know before the the\nThe president the president of Mexico leaves were they believe that would be no chance after that and the other point was they had to get Canada aboard because there was no chance it was going to pass\nIf there was only between Mexico and the United states so there was pressure on both sides\nUh Canada's been very quiet and was reading a few articles in the Canadian media over the last couple of weeks that was stating that was on purpose they said Trump can rail all he wants we're not going to say anything anymore we're done\nWe'll negotiate where we need to negotiate but we're not going to get in the back and forth with them because they believe that fuels\nIt ... it feels his passion and then support from what he is doing in the state so they said if he's just screaming and we're not responding it brings all the rhetoric down and they said Jared Kushner was the one who\nHelped the deal really you know get through on on a ... what the actual deal is we don't know but we don't see any major changes\nAh in the free trade deal steel and aluminum or not included don't know why on that one\nYeah and and nothing is done until it's done and the signed agreement will be the agreement\nOr yeah because it would they haven't even worked out everything you had just a a lot like Mexico and I and I do think that one of the things is they they said look we got we have to announce in we had to announce that we've come to an agreement to get the clock ticking on this and we can work things out over the next couple of months\nAgo right\nSo that takes it off the political table and gets behind the the number\nOne on one of the problems as we've always said it is with the president we have no idea since he has covered every single opinion on on trade we don't know where he stands we don't know what's acceptable or what's not acceptable he's gone from a complete protectionist\nA and a much of a you know rhetorical protectionist during the campaign\nAnd then ah he had the ability about to two months ago to be on Monday a complete free trader and by the end of the week was being protectionist again and so when you hold every opinion on free trade it's tough to figure where the president stands and what this eventual free trade agreement will look like\nUh but uh if it's more free trade and it's not protectionist as he promised in the campaign and his supporters are happy with it I'm fine with it\nYeah I mean it's it because it once and I think\nWe will get the aluminum and steel terrorists are those that is going to fix itself\nAt some point it will have to just the way it did during the Bush administration and it takes\nIt takes a lot longer for that process or let's say [noise]\nBack in the Bush years it took a lot longer for that process to play through to the market this year or or or these days I don't know that that's the case actually on on aluminum and steel\nBecause when you talk about the basis of the of manufacturing the base material for so much manufacturing you're going to have ... have already seen a number of industries\nScream over the the aluminum and steel ... so that's likely going to play itself out naturally the way it did during the Bush years\nWell you had a lot of financial publications just over the last five days saying ... the indicators are already in that the economy is starting to slow down in the United states and also in China because of the tariffs\nThat had been there and as we subtle along we believe that the president was absolutely wrong to isolate the United states if you wanted to isolate China\nBecause of their unfair trading practices yeah that you could win if you didn't isolate yourself if you ... the the goals should have always been isolate China don't isolate yourself because you are going to have basically the same free trade agreement that you have\nRight now with Canada Mexico and Europe were all modern western civilizations but you're not going to massively be able to put tariffs on all of their products and they'll let all of our products going free it doesn't work that way we knew it you're not going to get rid of the one hundred and fifty billion dollar\nA trade imbalance especially when you have such a huge\nInvestment surplus into the United states\nSo we knew that wasn't going to happen and so to us we thought there was a lot of wasted energy in the administration trying to\nUh have such incredible trade war rhetoric with Canada Mexico when Europe when there was really no reason to have it and and with the Asian countries as as well\nBut I Do think that when you see it you're going to see everybody claim their little victories here or there are already saw in Canada saying okay this is a great deal of great deals so they're going to be promoting their victories it'll be interesting to see the media in the United states promoting\nWhat is viewed as a victory and as we said you have to understand that when it comes to trade now a victory for a particular country is when the consumer has to pay more\nFor a product yeah that's how posterior backwards we are on ... it's a victory or consumers pay more yeah ha\nBut somehow that's\nThat's the way that it is is the last house promoted yet I was promoted that's the one that ... that have that the political positive right is what they say we're hurting the economy slightly All right good [laughter] that's what is the consumers pay because the consumers pay right\nAnd if the idea is protectionism which it is for targeted industry\nWhich it is then by definition you're asking well you're allowing that industry to raise their prices it's not just about being the tariff it's about paying the higher prices for the industry that\nYou say you're protecting and it's the first initial impacts as we've always talked about the initial impact as when you see that there's an over supply in the market and they can't sell it for as we've seen with a with a ... in many different growers in the United states\nWhen the Chinese tariffs hit and then they had to sell it you know that's what initially happens at rock bottom prices are you know everything because they need to get rid of it and then when the adjustment gums those prices will go the way right they'll go way up afterwards after you get rid of the stock the demon tore\nThat you already have that you have to get rid of and that's why you had so many was the pork producers of Iowa killed over the last four to five months and because of those particular terrorists because they had to drastically lower for as we said all along or economics is simply how people respond to incentive\nThat's it right\nOr ... or you can say distance set up and send them one way distance that's it\n... or anything else his opinion and the president can change that nobody can change that you can you can distort the market\nYou can help one industry wall hurting another industry but you can't change how people respond to it and send them a disincentive and so when you do that\nWhen you decide to raise prices you hurt the overall economy if you decide to raise taxes whether it's income tax or attached to terror you hurt industry\nYeah\nAnd it's that simple and I don't decide that Eric doesn't just to get people mad when we say that one of those some tax is helping the economy no they don't\nKnow no\nThey hurt an economy and so I'm a I Can't change it you can't change that none of us can change it the president can change it all you do is to start the market in some way\nAnd that's the that's the only effect of it and then then there's inevitably the reaction against that\nWhen the economy if the economy starts tanking steel and aluminum products start skyrocketing which they will by definition then the consumer is going to react to that when the consumer reacts to that the economy changes\nThat's when you have to have another political answer which is the opposite political answer that you gave for the first place you undo what you did\n\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound

Elliot Francis one year ago today a gun leaned out of a hotel window on the Las Vegas strip and started what would become the deadliest shooting rampage in us history John Lawrence were twenty\nMourners are in Las Vegas remembering the fifty eight people killed in a shooting rampage on this date and twenty seven team Richard ... lives in Orville California and he made the ten hour trip to Las Vegas\n... every six years\nWell they would decide whether ... whether to renew the buyout they after sixteen\nThey I Know but they would meet every six years yes well this thing they say that gives them what a couple of months to get this thing done and signed and if Trump were to win reelection that would put him at the very end of his second term\n\nRight but the next year meet right but the six year made would again that but you could meet and that would be a constant negotiate second when\nThat's that's my point it's a kicking the can down the road right yes yes\nUh\nThe exchange rate ... in a global first an apt to pack includes enforceable rules to deter countries from artificially weakening their exchange rates to gain trade advantages but the whole point is they said neither Canada United States and Mexico aren't doing that so it's not really a big deal\nA U.S to negotiate a greater access to Canada's dairy market as we said the president's talked about that a lot we're not sure what the actual cap would be on that but it is a small part of the actual trade deal overall\nJust as the whole thing with the United states has what the three hundred percent tariffs on tobacco that was going into Canada and so they probably decided\nThe rest is a dispute resolution which the Trump Administration had to make some compromises\nUh on a here's one under the agreement last month Mexico would be protected from any brunt of the national security tariffs the Trump Administration is considering ... vehicles in auto automobile parts and Canada got a similar deal which means with the president says it's about national security doesn't apply to Mexico or Canada anymore\nBut they still got to do a deal with steel and aluminum\nMhm\nSo that's where it is and it it also says that that uh the other countries cannot use dragons or wizards well as you said but oh they were making their vehicle set overall you we knew where you're gonna have you're going to have little victories here or there but the as we said overall\nYou know Ninety nine percent of the or Ninety eight percent is going to flow across duty free everywhere else on every\nOther product mhm and that's still has to go there still has to be approved oh\nYeah yeah it's supposed to be approved or not you know are lawmakers still have to get this thing yeah yeah oh by the way they kicked it too after you know there's this basically gives them sixty days to get it done but assume that the Republicans don't retain the house\nThan Republicans are going to feel pressured in December\nIf they get this thing written up and done to vote on this in December because they're saying right now this gives them another sixty days to get out the details right and that's the devil's always in the details and that's where you have possibly Elaine con\nWell my point is this is mostly this has been symbolic across the board and write a it always has been ... that Ninety eight percent are still gonna be duty free the president's not going to get rid of the hundred and fifty billion dollar a trade imbalance that we have that's going to be the natural flow of investment\nAnd however that goes and you know we're attempting to protect North America remember the protection though it's going to raise the cost of goods and services\nSo overall if you look at the automobile terrorists depending on how bad it's overall\nAnd I have not seen an estimate on that you raise the cost of cars which will hurt if the steel and aluminum tariffs still remain that will increase the cost of goods and services that will decrease GDP yeah ah we've never been sure what the president wanted to accomplish\nA especially recently over the last few months because he is held every position on free trade from unfettered free trade or no duties tariffs anything on any products\nTo fallout protectionist policies so we don't know\nWhere the president never stood on this to begin with a window when the campaign he wanted to get rid of the hundred and fifty billion dollar deficit as we said that's\nNot going to happen with the free trade agreement now and if you make things more expensive\nPeople will respond and it looks like that especially on cars\nThe United states Canada and Mexico has decided for your benefit to make automobiles more expensive for you that's one of the problems they're having with new vehicles right now the ... that's the whole point that at the end it's only going to get worse yes\nGovernment at work but at least\nMexico Canada and the United states have a great together to raise the cost of automobiles well what her instead as\nThey are and what happens when the new the new vehicle cost goes up the demand for used vehicles goes up which means skyrocketing right up prices are going way up\n\nWhere you saw that already ... it's been out the last you know the last month or so that that a used car vehicles you know the sales are skyrocketing the demand is skyrocketing which means the prices sky rocket\nAnd that's exactly what you're seeing a but now you you have essentially by the time they get this thing done you're going to nail that coffin shut that's a done deal\n\nAnybody believe ... ever going to reverse well anybody tell me how it makes our economy better by making the cost of automobiles more expensive for Canada Mexico and the United states\nRight we're all in it together though sure\nVictory and that's the big got it done by the way that the big victory and we've made cars expensive for everybody that's when\n... oh and Canada's buying more cottage cheese and [laughter] I mean it's just yeah we're idiots\nWell I mean that's [laughter]\nBecause they really are really good price when the price of a vehicle goes up are you ever seeing anything in terms of the average price coming down no the cost of government has been driving the cost of vehicles up for a long long time well the the other point that middle class families can't afford it and now\nMore and more as you drive the price artificially the price of the of the use the ethical goes up you're also making it harder for middle class families to afford those mhm\n\nYou hurt the poor in the middle class the most ... saw an article uh the that came out over the weekend about the the the battle that's going on right now with the the big three well they used to be domestic but they're not ... is not domestic bought the dodge Ford and Chevrolet\nAnd pick up say I saw that yes where you know you've got fifty thousand dollar vehicles and now some of those trucks can get up to a hundred thousand dollars\nMan I Love my old truck I Love it\nBecause you look at the cost of government associated with such a purchase and it will frankly will drive you nuts but it might also save you some money [laughter] and rather rebuild everything on my truck than\nThan go pay the cost of government re they're beautiful trucks but when you when you factor in the cost of government sorry that's where I have to draw the line I haven't seen anything on the soft temper thing you know soft butter we got that [laughter]\nWell because talked to her I mean the increase in construction cost here in the United states by\nUh uh also I mean it's it's a look it's the one thing\nIt's the one thing that uh the great debate in this country we know on the show because we've been criticized for stating that increasing the cost of materials to build good irrespective of who does it is bad and the response for many people know if Trump does that it's right if others do it it's wrong\nThat of others raise the cost of goods and services that's bad if Trump raises it will he knows what he's doing well there's never been a time in recorded history ever in economics we're raising the cost of goods and services makes an economy overall better you may help certain factions you can help this person over here\nBut if you think they said this is the unions are going to love the fact that we're raising the cost of\nBuilding a car really unions are thrilled that's a good deal making cars more expensive ...\nMaking used cars more expensive making people you know how people but they're holding on their vehicles a lot longer now mhm my old vehicles Fifteen Years old some people are holding the average was it eleven twelve years now\nMhm and that
