walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding Saturday his plans will not affect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote\nScheduled for the same day ... speaking to Shannon brain which means decided to be late last night right uh and Fox News ... said he personally called cabin up Thursday evening and told him I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed so that isn't going to delay anything it was funny because you said\nWell you know it it wears his daughter getting married and in Montana it legit you inside right I don't think he wants anybody you know\nProbably doesn't want anyone to know and because and that really spells out how crazy this thing is a and has become the left believes going direct especially after confronting a Jeff Flake that it's working\nThat they're you know that that the tactic is not only working but acceptable\nAnd we'll shame you out of a restaurant will uh will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere as directed or I guess to encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters\nAnywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you are getting their face well that becomes dangerous because it's impossible for somebody to be able to assess a threat just imagine in your everyday life and you're not a lawmaker uh\nUnless we have lawmakers listening which we often do and we thank you for that but you're not included here you're just walking around ... thank you or the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for listening and and also Senator Lindsey Graham for years like this I guess\nAnd probably ramble although he's screaming know all the time but [laughter]\nWe actually love ramp all but\nIf you're walking around you know in public the average person and someone just ran up to you and started screaming your face\nYou wouldn't know what they're doing you know you don't you don't know what the threat level is the ... and and and certainly it's it's different when you were Jeff Flake and you're confronted and the way he was and you you you know why they're in your face\nBut you can't assess the threat level in public you can you just cannot you don't know what the person who is capable of doing if they're good you know they're physically harmed you um it's it's impossible to assess that\nSo that such security has been ramped up a tremendous uh the restaurant in fact that where Ted Cruz was shamed out of the restaurant a first of all kudos to the restaurant saying you know because you can hear a person in the background on that video saying look you can't you know tell

rally vague and Barbara coup that the nation's highest court has a new justice and Brett Kavanaugh as correspondent Linda Kenny on reports\nRepublican John Cornyn says the confirmation process where Brett Kavanaugh traveled a bumpy road there is no lower road than the one we haven't been on top Senate Democrat Charles Schumer says there is one more avenues that can be used to effect change change must come\nFrom where change in America always begins\nThe ballot box cabin on now add to the ranks of conservatism according can affect the American landscape for generations\nPresident Trump rally supporters in Topeka, Kansas ahead of the midterm election\nA Murkowski and mansion went into a room and had a meeting we don't know what was discussed but it appears that it's really coming down to\nThose now because you have essentially Heitkamp is said she's no so essentially right now the only Democrat it looks like you might be able to count on is Joe match\n\nSo if you've got every Republican on board assuming that Jeff Flake who say yes then that gets you to fifty two\nIf Jeff Flake is a no you're still on the soft headcount you're still at fifty one with mansion with match\nIf for some reason Manchin pulls out or Murkowski or they it doesn't appear the columns will if Collins had a ...\nIssue that concern about the report saying I'm not sure we got everything\nAt the very least she would've question something praising the report tells me you can count on that vote so right now you're looking at I mean I think at the very least fifty with the vice president being the typewriter at fifty one\nUh the word from and and there was another story in the\nIn the wall Street Journal that the you know the GOP right now is a is really upbeat about the confirmation process they you know they\nGot or if you look at it that the the talk right now is that they're confident uh so you get through\nA a culture which will happen sometime during the day on friday as you mentioned Gary the process will start mid morning um but then the actual vote may not happen until later in the afternoon\nWhen by the time they get through the procedure one with the actual both take place and then there was a third\nIn the already our lives the clocks stop starts at that point yet up there and they can take up to thirty hours it may not take thirty hours\nThey could end the debate before thirty hours but\nAssuming they'll use the entire thirty hours and they might ah especially on a Saturday the media might give them the\nThe news media cable news might give them you know all the time of the world are so you look at the the so called hopefuls for twenty twenty your usual suspects I'm a warrant and all of them looking to get camera time\nOr the debate might you know go on the full thirty just assume that it will they'll that's that's why you've got the rule assume that it will so that puts it late into Saturday Night as you mentioned earlier Gary\nDepending on where they landed on the the the clock lands on the culture wrote maybe into early Sunday Morning but that gives them there's the I guess the wiggle room or the enough room for senator Danes to get\nYou know home from the wedding I guess or\nOr back to work for the wedding and ah as daughter's wedding and we wish your daughter and her\nSoon to be husband all the best uh but they'll he'll get back he's saying he'll get back in time for the vote so that tells us it's probably going to be a late Saturday Night well\nYou know I I I think about all the and you know I'm just sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the all the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain\nThings you know that when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on and if you look over the last eight years and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street you\nKnow all all that that that ah that went on all the the\nThe occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that you have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be quite intimidating but here's the question is it effective for them right has it been effective\nIn and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration\nI mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that mhm so you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were\nRiots in certain cities that that happened when the police tried to push them off but at this is almost the exclusive domain Bob the left and therefore the Democrats sure yeah\nAnd you think about the run that they have had since all of this you know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street\nAs just the beginning of of this portion of it has it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation tactics will actually work\nAnd change for example they're not ... you know you you you could see\nIf they might be a you know threatening a just a a you know the the senators that are on you know a lot of you know on the edge right now right okay on the margins but they're not they're going after everybody ... here whether it's Grassley doesn't care whether McConnell what\nDo they really think that that's affected or is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage because that's what it is\nIt just insane rage that they're filled with right now just anger and ... and and rage is it just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that is affected\nBy just I'm really wondering [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before we started talking about this I'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter] so I'm never going to find out because I'm not going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right well\nI I I think after the ... like\nA thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent but I think it's probably a ... a lot of I was gonna say little of both I think it's a lot of both actually that they believe after confronting mansion\nAnd after ... you know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants\nI mean think about that Gary that youre not protesters in a restaurant\nYou work there it's your job and you refuse in one case to do it for because Sarah Huckabee Sanders is eating the food you're going to prepare and serve can you imagine that can you imagine being in that mentality\nNo\nIf I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nAnd bar rock Obama and his family came in\nThe last thing that I Would do is refused to do my job me not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did and that's the mentality\nBut that's where they that's where they live\nAnd we go back to the one restaurant where you had a man having to be African\nAmerican wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a stable to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine\nI cannot imagine I wouldn't be able to face my friends and family\nIf I did something so despicable just shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS as long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that\nI don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against and I remember\nIt was about you know we've talked about it before is probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about and\nAnd it was really you know somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professionally and and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a a a black man who was a huge fan of my show\nNow I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that you refer to as you described it before I went\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk would you have good to see your ah they were stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage but we could not believe that\nBad mental health is among the days when they struggled with things like stress and depression people who play team sports

and it's been a while since we've had you on the show and it's good to get an update from you because you guys are always coming out with cool new things that we need to be talking about so\nAre we missed your audio Technica counterparts and colleagues at ... a month or so ago when we were there for sixteen the are broadcasting from Iowa fate or but I Know you've got some more cool things that you introduced their so give us an idea\nSome of the things that we didn't get a chance to talk about\nThe new products that we did introduce it eats up or a pair of up to ... earphones um and we did a sound reality a version and we also do they fought export version which is more toward that uh\nYou know the athlete or the guy working out and you know these are part of our ah Sal reality in a

fidelity audio and you know\nAudio Technica we are committed were always listening so we are committed to providing the best quality audio at a very good reasonable price and then the market\nWell it's been our experience that you guys have always hung in there for the true audio files and and really some of the best quality on the market anywhere and that's of course evident I'm sure in your new goodies is well\nNot only were you announcing them and showing them at ... but I understand that the upcoming Rocky Mountain audio fast and they're going to be highlighted as well\nAnd we've actually have folks are heading out that way today so there'll be a showing these products at that show and of course the upcoming CBS show in January\nOf course it will be our twenty four year broadcasting from CBS so so we'll certainly be it'd be doing our part to uh you know to bring a new and exciting things to our audience there as well you guys have remained committed to buying all\nOver the year over the years of course in a lot of folks have decided oh vinyl is big again let's jump on that bandwagon well you guys never really left you know you've always said\nVinyl is important certainly a resurgence means that a company like audio Technica is ready to handle the any requests especially from the younger folks never knew what a record was up but now they're getting into it because of a much better sound and the civility and all but you got a whole new line of photo cartridges as well\nYes we do a you know our heritage is vital it goes all the way back to our very first photo cartridges cartridge which was the eighty one and that was developed by our founder in Nineteen sixty two and and that heritage lives on\nA our new line of follow cartridges is based on what we call the v M concept and we basically replicate what the record a wave cut her head does\nIn reverse so we're trying to maintain that same physical layout that the shaped I'm a alignment and that's going to allow that cartridge to track better\nAnd we launch the original series of vi I'm cartridges about a year ago and we've just up dated a cartridge flying with a a continuation of that vi I'm cartridge series\nUm we like to say we're involved in that vinyl experience\nAnd ah we make turned able to make cartridges we make everything from the entry level turntable to someone that wants to get into vinyl all the way up to a some pretty high end audio file pieces in parts and uh and some of our moving called cartridges are right up there with a with the rest of the real true audio file gear\nOr the cool thing about the vinyl experience as it is a tactile listening experience as opposed to somebody downloading a file\nAnd I think that is why the younger generation is rediscovering the final they discovered mom and dad's records in the attic they are discovering that uh although they said at one time that digital media and the CD was the so called pure audio thing the uh\nThe sound of a good vinyl record is absolutely amazing and played back on a good turntable with a decent cartridge it is an experience and people are listening to their records or they're getting people together they're getting that new release their on rapping that record\nAnd reading the liner notes in plain sight wanted its entirety and then playing side too and it's entirely something that you really can experience for the digital downloads\nAnd we're seeing you know we literally can't keep turntables in stock we get them in by the container load and they go right out the door so we're excited that the vinyl vinyl experience is happening and that the a vial is is actually out selling digital downloads in some areas\nTo get info about using that satellite Internet that's correct a loving it\nGail in Fairbanks, Alaska listens on nine Seventy am K. F. B. acts hello Gail\nI've been reading some information regarding nano Christ electricity um and I was wondering how you see that are coming about how our infrastructure would adapt to that I'm In particular are a mobile devices\nWell Gail nano crystal electricity is kind of a nice marketing rapper around really an old concept yes it's wireless electricity so you could power a device that is not plugged into anything and do it while you use it but all the problems that existed during ... time still exist now\nAnd that's a nickel a Tesla not to the car company you're right that's a good point way back you know now that the wireless transmission is extremely inefficient them because of that it has a very short range the power corrupts very quickly as the distance grows\nThe bottom line ends up being that you get about three feet of usable power so it's not as efficient at charging your devices as a cable is it ... because it's always transmitting and really three feet of cable or even ten feet for that matter cost very little\nYou won't see any big changes to our infrastructure anytime Sam and this technology is not really workable at the moment and it's unlikely that it will change anytime soon because the problem is not engineering that fix the inverse square law that's getting in the land that power distribution method\nFor oh excuse me very hard I mean look at it that well that's an inverse square law who\nFor now gets by a longer cable\n[laughter] sounds like a low tech solution but it really is gay all the way to go it we're not looking at at this capability

unreasonable to expect a former flagship to last only a few years\nIf the process is not responding as an app you can install it may be time for it to go if it's not and it's part of the operating system it may be worth restoring the phone to factory settings\nYou can go wrong with an older phones some from use some from age some from software and it's really hard to pinpoint what's causing issue without running some tests\nBut if it's software related restoring the phone will likely make it go away if it's not software related even if you find out what the problem is it probably won't

better\nBecause you're resetting you're getting rid of all the junk and all the all the other stuff that you may have had on the phone unfortunately it doesn't get rid of the crap where is that the

in may is now rolling out to users the feature allows users to create a shortlist of restaurants or other destinations that can be shared with friends so they can vote\nSeeing the endless planning

help them make those decisions in in a group basis at least he's actually it says you can use the feature by long pressing each location to drag into a shortlist can then be shared with the friends that you invite\nThe group will be able to see the relative locations of each just destination and their apple browser and they can vote with a thumbs up or thumbs down and Google will keep score\nMembers of the group are also free to have their own suggestions so I liked that concept because it's not necessarily when you're looking to go out to eat with some friends is not what's closest to you it's what\nDo you feel like you know what what are your taste buds calling out and maybe that's a good way to do it so it's really narrowing it down but it is to say it's going to get

grave line we've talked on the show over the years and certainly more now than ever before a growing number of small businesses organizations all kinds of folks doing their own promotions these days and looking of course to social media management platforms\nTo help schedule their social media posts do also analyzed the performance of those post and reply to their community whether public relations manager for an organization called buffer is Haley Griffiths Haley welcome into tomorrow how are you\nI'm great thank you so much for having me day if\nIt's a pleasure to have you because you do and we have some experience with buffer as well for our into tomorrow dot com site you do help manage\nA social media accounts in in many ways but certainly the ability to get the word out you know and oh hey guess what we've got Haley Griffiths from buffer on the show this week where it'll automatically\nPut things out on our various social media posts and boy does that make life easier\nBut we hope so that's definitely the point is to save people time and small businesses especially you know you have so many things on the go anywhere that we can cut a few minutes or even an hour out of your week said anytime on something like social media management it it's really a pleasure\nFor sure and and it's really easy to use I mean I fortunately don't do a lot on the Web we have a team that does that because they know what they're doing but I'm told that anyone can sign up for free correct me if I'm wrong and and start to get used to how buffer can make a difference for you or your organization your small business whatever the case\nUm and ... give me a better idea than what I described as to how buffer helps folks\nYeah absolutely so one of the main thing is what we've just talked about in terms of saving people time but also keeping everything in one place I mean usually as a business there are several places where audience might be that you want to reach than it whether it's\nTwitter Instagram Facebook maybe linked in and that's a lot to manage do we help people by putting it all in one place you can schedule opposed to go across your network and across several different accounts so you know days maybe you'd want to go out on your personal account as well as the into tomorrow count and we make it a lot easier to put one message and\nAnd how they sent out in multiple places so definitely saving people's time we have some really beautiful analytics\nSo that people can go into buy for and see how are my posts you in what is it that my audiences really interacting with and what's really resonating with them and then we do also has a way for people to reply to comments and and treat Twitter replies and even in in a Facebook\nComments and things like that through buffer to sell it just sort of like an all around way to help people manage their social media\nAnd it's great that I I think that's a terrific part that you could also have it go to other accounts because of course you're going to have your business the cows and you're you're a post some information should go out to all the social media but your business is smart enough to be on\nBut the fact that you can also do it with you know individuals' is also very helpful because like in your case public relations manager you want to get the word out to about things that maybe your main buffer couch has done\nAnd and I certainly would as you brought up you don't want to do the same for hey guess who's on the show this week we're talking to people like Haley and so forth\nThat I wanted to automatically go out on my personal one as well\nAnd that's as if that's not good enough you've got the ability to have all these cool I'm a response in you know bits of information that the idea of\nOf um you know the analytics which makes such a different time do you find that people get a little bit confused by those and and takes a little learning curve maybe to figure that out or are they just instantly helpful\nWhen we try to make them as easy as possible so ideally even if you have no analytics background which honestly is is myself and many people like you know I'm not a professional at at analyzing the data\nBut ideally it's going to be really easy when you go in there very colorful chart it's really easy to to click three things to see if you're looking for today or tomorrow are you looking at just ... looking at Twitter and Instagram though\nAnd they've made it quite easy set you can kind of go in and then really get the information that you're looking for which is usually what's doing well and what can we do more of and so um we were helping people get the answer to that as simply as possible\nAnd that is so important for what the business especially or an organization a school or association whatever the case what's working do more of what you're getting virtually no response from or very little wealth do less of that and and it might be\nTime of day or day a week or ... or what you're posting you know does it include a picture or a video and therefore it's likely more likely I'm guessing to get noticed that justice text um those are the kinds of things that I think are easy for\nEven people like you and I took grass [laughter]\nYeah absolutely absolutely and it's true there are so many different maybe your audience is\nOn line on weekends but you don't want to be working on weekends so that makes a lot of sense to schedule that that you're still engaging with your audience on the weekends through those social media posts that having to work yourself\nSo it's very true that there are definitely different days and times of the day that work better depending on who your audience as\nPure and I'm assuming that you're analytics also help determine what best days and times you should be posting to various social media and\nHave you discovered that it's better to tweet on this day and time versus Instagram ing or Facebooking on this day in time I mean do you do help determine those kinds of things as well and then of course buffer will set it up for you\nWe have a couple of different resources to help people figure that out the\nAnswer is that it's quite complicated in it totally depends on your audience I mean are they on the east coast and west coast and they're in Europe but\nIt you know at the time zone that the people that you're trying to reach our end is doing a drastic ...\nChange when you want your post to go out so we do have many resources for people to start discovering this themselves and then in the analytics it's just easy to go in and see wow and getting all of my engagement on Monday maybe I should schedule more things to go out on Monday or you know I'm posting to Lincoln on the weekend and no one's responding probably catch people who use Lincoln\nAre not using it on the weekends so maybe I should change this Monday through friday so the analytics definitely have several ways to show you what's working and then it yeah like you said it's super easy to that and put that into your schedule so that from then on when you're entering posts into buffer they're going into spots where you know your audience it on line\nAnd I love the fact that you can schedule them various times are on each different social media right it's not like okay this is going to go out it's going to go out everywhere at this day in time I have no control you've got complete control right\nAbsolutely yeah you can set a different time and you know we do we do this we set a different time for Twitter then for Instagram then for Facebook because we're posting blame or on Twitter than we are on Instagram and Facebook and Instagram maybe one we want to post in the morning to get people when\nThey're on their morning commute and checking Instagram on the bus or something like that you know so I'm absolutely you can change the schedule for each social platform and then as you add things and it'll just be put into\nThe spot that's next going out\nTo reflect imagining folks listening and saying well that sounds great so do I do a post on my website and then I I've said buffer up so it automatically grabs maybe whatever featured image I'm using and and puts it out to the various social media that we use of does it do that kind of thing as well\nAbsolutely yeah you can just take the link from that post and put it into a buffer and we will we will grab that featured image\nFor you it or you can choose any of the other images that are on that are on that blog posts because sometimes you might want to choose more than one on is on several social networks you can share my more than one photo with a post\nProvides a tech to every single week what are you got

do\nSo if you're going to search for a washing machine don't be surprised if the next day you're surfing the Web you're on Facebook even your on anything and washing machine ads pop up\nI think that's

it's creepy it's weird but it happens now if you don't want that to happen then don't search for stuff but then that makes life very boring\nAnyway and then how do you get good information just

issues complaints concerns problems that you may be having some technical rage that you might want to share I'm doing great lines thanks for joining us our next guest works to understand the dynamics and implications of interactions among people\nIn immersive virtual reality simulations\nThat in of itself got our attention he's also the author of experience on demand and founding director of Stanford University's virtual human interaction lab Jeremy balance and\nJeremy welcome into tomorrow how you doing Dave I'm doing great thanks for having me\nIt's a pleasure to the first thing right out of the box and and your book does a great job of it is what virtual reality is how it works and what it can do because we get so tied up especially in all of our years doing this show and people talk about VR and augmented reality at all the other ... mixed realities cetera\nThat sometimes we stopped ... we have to stop and go back and say well wait a minute what is it that we're talking about how do you best describe what VR is\nFor our listeners who haven't done VR it's like you're inside of a movie as opposed to watching it what makes me are different is two things one is\nIt tracks your body moving so the way you interact with the scene is by walking or moving your hands are turning your head it's as if you are just grabbing objects and walking around the room the second differences at its perceptions surrounding wherever you look you see things they're sounds that are ... there's touch that goes to your skin\nAnd it's a perceptual experience that's not looking just at a scream wherever you are the content of their\n... their you truly are immersed in whatever it is you're experiencing virtual reality\nThat we like to say my colleague Byron ... first person to have this quote as the brain has not yet evolved to understand better virtual experience isn't real if you think about how long evolution has taken its only very recently that we've had\nDigital media and extremely recently that we've had this amazing stereoscopic virtual experiences that you know that for so long when we've taken a step forward objects have gotten bigger when they get closer and that's how we are work so the brain is still trying to figure out if we are as real and how compelling these experiences are\nAnd and what a great way to ah to to put that in that kind of perspective too I think it's awesome ... every time I visit a especially China and we're seeing various trader Joes and they're they're showing virtual reality or they strap somebody on\nUnlike the U.S which is such a ... society they don't have a lot of lawsuit so they they let people wander and literally fall over on the floor and\nYou walk into the wall and all that sort of thing where I Would never go here because everybody would say oh my gosh the liability up but what's bizarre about that is that you watch people literally falling over because they they're falling off a cliff for doing something and hitting the floor hitting a wall\nOf that is part of that immersion is it not I mean you if you really the braids taking over\nIn that scene they've I could tell you\nOf lives I've saved in my lab people just deciding to spontaneously do back flipped people diving to cross this chasm\nThat isn't there and and they're getting towards the sharp table [laughter] I I actually just published a about four weeks ago an article on slate that has my eight rules for safety and we are so what you were describing just letting people run around walk into walls is not what we do in my lab good salad I recommend for home consumers I think you raise the right point though\nWe are so immersive [noise] you know we need to solve these\nPossible safety issue how do you you know not run into the walls and Don how do you not step on the cat and God Forbid walk into traffic or or drive a car with this stuff\nSo of course I mean I've had a listeners tell us oh it's so cool and then I tripped over the coffee table and it was like well how is that is so cool you bruised are you okay yeah yeah yeah it's healing you know it was like their concern was that they were just so immersed in this VR\nThat they just they really didn't pay much attention is like the they really did take the fall will be in real life you did\nOh so you almost you almost need a padded room I guess if you're going to do it right\nIt's funny you say that so I I work with a lot of National Football league teams to help their quarterback and other players get better without through a company I co founded called strive for and the first team that we\nInstalled a system for was at the Dallas Cowboys and Jason Garrett surprised us when we when we showed up to install the hardware he'd actually built a room with a padded floor and cleared out all the safety hazards he built the perfect safety or him and he really wanted to quarterbacks to\nGo into the are look around recognize that defense call out their plays really loudly do their three step\nDrop you really wanted them to go through the body motions of implementing a place so that they could get extra not just mental rehearsal ... muscle memory for what to do given different defense of packages and and the padded floor helped\nWow that's cool because I'm thinking that has to make a difference and the only thing you're worrying about is\nThe VR headset perhaps being damaged or maybe you know bruising your forehead or something but at least but they can literally let go and just do everything that they should do and if they fall there hopefully not hurting themselves but you got to learn a whole lot more I think in that kind of an environment\nThe monster that I take that fear is not for everything a day when I when I talk to the big tech companies and I spent a lot of time that the leadership level in Silicon valley trying to\nHelp them navigate issues of not just physical safety mental safety what should you should do and VR and you know because of some of the things you're bringing up you know I don't want a world where people are using VR for hours and hours per day I don't want to Worldwatch people or you\nKnow surfing the Web and reading email or through the ... not for that it's it's really meant to be this intense immersive experience that's her special if there are things that you couldn't do in the real world things that were impossible to do or dangerous to do so I think one way around the things that you're talking about is you know in my lab we've got a twenty minute ... great", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio",
