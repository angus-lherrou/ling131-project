tell ... and the fact is neither side is news you needed the players association and the NFL\nIs moving on this because remember how long they've been meeting for you know remember we're going to me to try to\nCome to some resolution medium for yeah it's\nI mean they still have the policy but there won't be you'll find there won't be any kind of penalty\nIt's don't ask don't it don't ask don't tell what they're hoping what they're hoping is is that the players association because every it's tick tick tick tick tick and the contract negotiations doubt what\nTwo and a half years away mhm but the negotiations can be starting yeah they could be going on right now right right wow you know why go she H okay\nHold on a second because we talked about you know how uh the the uh the players association could be saying look we got to go she Asians coming up it could've been guys were starting talks right now or at least getting into the early stages of these talks and this is affecting yet\nRight we can we cannot have ... down TV ratings right or you know in another year and a half everybody has to be\nEverybody has to be on board go protest wherever you want right of course because all of a sudden these players are saying this could affect my next contract and oh well then hey protests wherever you want a look we made a deal\nUh the NFL's giving to our particular causes so we won that but no like air greater Colin Kaepernick it doesn't matter what the deal is struck they just they they view the deal being struck as a you know and and remember the Arab greed UC deal being struck\nTo not Neal and to keep ... out of the\nYou know out of the players association that was going to decide where all that money goes to basically say no capital you're not a part of in a Arab greed wants to continue kneeling there's the there's a group or the the there's the one or two\nAre out there that wish to continue kneeling no matter what and there's the other group saying what we got our cash shut up there\nAnd so now there's a ... so the NFL the owners probably said look\nDon't ask don't tell and it's a liberal it's liberals fighting liberals and it'll eventually blow up in their faces yeah I'm Glad that we and then we can move on\nYeah I mean I I think you're I think you're probably right on it's probably you know unofficially don't ask don't tell for me it's a don't watch don't care\n[laughter] [laughter] well maybe that's the thing if there is no reason to watch my team anyway because they're not colonizing\nWell yeah I mean you know my my team attempting to I I just saw the headline attempted to come back you know over the uh the Redskins this past weekend and then you know couldn't get it done\nBut I I I think\nOf again the bigger picture of the fact that\nIt's not just the protests driving the people that you you you've got two big things to overcome right you got to bring back the people who left because of the protest but you got to bring people back who left because they they're watching other things because they're doing\nOther things I mean that's where I think a lot of the erosion is you've got to create new excitement in the NFL\nNot just in the whole protest thing you've got to create new excitement in the broadcast presentation of the game\nAnd\nThey haven't even started on that I mean\nUh you know the are you seeing a lot of the movement to digital and and we knew that comic there's got to be more of that in the in the in the coming years\nNo doubt but that's about reaching the audience where they are but you know you put a store where the traffic is right so you put your game your presentation is going to be where the traffic is if it's on digital if a if it's on line and that's where you're\nGoing to find that audience but you've also got to change and I think that will help change the presentation of the game\nBut that's something nobody focusing on right now because they can't get through you know this is even if it's just a handful of players if it's making the news\nIt's like you know come on guys it's time to get back to football but you can't get there because these stories still make the news\nThat you know if it's like the left\nYou look at a uh a war and and a Casio Cortez they don't represent the majority of the uh the the rank and file Democrat out there but they're leading the party if they're making the news and they're driving motivation on the other side\nAs a result of it is a ... ... was a Tim Ryan\nYou know challenge Nancy Pelosi for for his seat and and you know we've got to get away from the identity politics and and everything else\nAnd who else so that a couple of others have said that um but they can't\nBecause it's not making the noise I mean the the I guess being a more moderate Democrats if you could they would still be far left but\nGetting away from you know the identity politics in it or whatever it is that's driving the far far left well where where do you a moderate where do you because that's not making the news that's not making\nThe social media or that's not where the interest is by the mainstream media it's boring so it's you know this this is this is all you know part of well\nAnd I mean really scrambled equation and what you see here is what you see happening and then they in in the Democratic party where you have victims in the oppressors and ...\nAnd as we've said this that the identity politics you continue to cut the pie of victims becomes greater but then when the number of victims becomes greater than the number of oppressors\nA must you know must become a greater\nOr you know we've seen it a ... look ... last week you saw the most of the cycling though the women cycling a champion you know the the the the mail one the biological mail one and the female came out and said it was the the two females that are are one of the females who came in\nLike third place she goes this is ridiculous this was a male right and he has gone crazy stating the bigotry and the intolerance and right and and and and and all that because I Know you're a you know you're a man you're not a woman so that's the debate that goes on and so as we said\nThe feminist up today the ... the old time feminist which to protest is the new time that the new feminist do not want to protest this but you destroy feminism as we said all along\nThe feminists have now become the oppressors thinking about this did you ever think that the feminist would become the oppressors of liberals right now the feminist the feminist movement this is how insane it is and what you have here is in the in the NFL you of Eric greed you know up\nMalcolm you know Malcolm Jenkins was part of the group that agreed that okay uh the owners are going to give a hundred you know a hundred million dollars for the for the organizations that we wish to give money to\nTo help make racism less mhm okay fine All right we will we agree that we're not going to Neal anymore ... well now he is viewed by air agreed and camper and act as\nThe oppressor he is a Neal colonialist right he's a sellout right because the whole the the real thing is with the ... or a read\nThey don't want a deal no they want to be able to scream oppression so so the victims some of the victims now that we're perceived as the victims here in the NFL or those in the NFL standing up for who they perceive\nThe victims were\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump\nThey're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better\nAnd the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant and they want it's\nThis constant that debate out there they want to be able to cry racism day in and day out and the fact that it's never going to be styled because it can't be solved once it solved or once you get to where most people believe society is today or racism is not a factor like it was\nFifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago\nThey have to win says that it's actually worse than it's ever ban or they lose their purpose their purpose has gone they can't say that things are getting better for it and so boom it's going to blow up and a significant portion\nOf the NFL of blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes that we believe are good causes now they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens\nRight and what's happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL\nWe've been saying for years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing with you nearly with you as the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow and that's what's happening now Malcolm Jenkins is a sellout\nLearn more

give them and a good morning [noise]\nYou know as we we talked about the uh the mid term\nElections and and the latest\nUh uh NBC analysis and by the way to get somebody to get a few people say that's fake news uh I've a feeling that\nThat is more uh from from what I could perceive ... from the anger of the the people stating that the NBC story was fake news and I do believe they are more on the left\nAnd pop and and this this was the ... because we as the question right is this fake news because NBC reporting that ah ... you know the ... more Republicans are are going out to vote in early voting in a in the the eight states that uh they have looked at seven other states with\nA I mean basically toss up right where are tossed up or close up the Senate races out there that the Republicans lead only one state Nevada\nDo what the Democrats or a leader at the at the moment and we've talked about you know what might be influencing this election and we know that the whole cabinet thing is we when we it's more than just a Supreme Court justice it's it's about everything\nThat was surrounding that it's it's from the ... you know the the uh non belief in\nA in a in instability it's about the non belief\nIn due process under the law it's clearly where it it what has come out of this that the left doesn't believe that the Senate should exist anymore that the electoral college should go away and it's something that we have said for the longest time and I wondered because we've been saying this for years\nAnd it really started out with the whole it it started out with the whole free speech the first amendment issue\nWhen it came to and this goes back what ten Fifteen Years ago a about a well corporations and groups don't have free speech free speech is only for the individual and we said that's ridiculous and then we got to the whole thing the the whole member of the slogan corporations aren't people by the way I got that I saw that the other day somebody actually\nYou set the other day I thought that had died out or but that's still out there well of course new that's as we said if you're going to make that argument then nobody should ever able nobody should ever be able to protest her property taxes because property isn't the person\nWell of course but people pay the property taxes and corporations are made up of people and those people in corporations have just as many free speech rights as anybody else not involved in a corporation which is why a corporation\nIs a set of rules and regulations set up by the government to regulate business you don't lose your free speech rights because you want to enter into a a a a government policy right you don't lose your free speech rights\nOr you know because of it and so it's an easy argument to\nTo dissipate but we said back then we send them when that started coming out with so they really don't believe in free speech they believe in free speech because they do business has been negative businesses wrong that's their argument businesses evil therefore evil people shouldn't have free speech rights\nAnd and so we you know and it's not a pop but back then it wasn't a popular opinion to haul no I mean we were ... for that but what do you mean corporation yeah people ... you may not like it but yeah\nPeople well why should why should they have it because their goal is to make money and the matter what their goal is are are they stealing or ah right they still for money right a buddy\nThrough AOL colonial because it was it was it was coupled [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd it's real bad [laughter] but the but the thing is is that um the the\nIt was it was part of the whole\nWell there's too much money in politics or oh who's the guy that was on um

migrants lived drum Lawrence reports\nIncident Trump threatens to slash eight to several Central American countries in response to the caravan heading toward the U.S Republican Senator Jeff flake says those funds help those nations with law enforcement and drug interdiction\nCutting those programs indiscriminately um those benefit us as well former\nVice president Joe Biden says Mr Trump is overreacting he's making this sound like\nThey're breaking through to the border [noise] this is a scary idea as far as I'm John Lawrence report\nIn northern California judge was upheld a decision that's on Monsanto's weed killer cause the cancer of a landscaper however the judge slashed that workers two hundred eighty seven million dollar award to just Seventy eight million to respond Monsanto purposely ignored warnings and evidence that it's popular wound up product caused a wing Johnson's lymphoma them\nSuperhighway and and I think that we're going to come through America up through ah on the Canada and that was something that literally my father had to say that's not\nHappening it's not happening and so when you see these images that is a conservative paper train and I guess in the mid term elections because this is exactly what conservatives think people on the last one to have happened in this country I'm not saying I think refugees are not paying not accept legal immigration\nWhat what a lot of people on a lot to say no one on the table is the one open water and and no consequences\nWould I Do wish I wish that the then the people on the right to tell the truth about what's really happening and immigration because the largest number of undocumented against him not telling you know I think people in the right answer right here on the right but I'm not talking about you\nBut I'm saying and I don't think I Am more\nSeem on that issue then I think than I think people realize I come from a border said and I think when you hear stories like that happening finally shot and killed by an immigrant who is in a I'm a dyed in San Francisco which is one that says you can go there now\nAnd I said at the same way and count thanks or if I let me just say this and you have a cat\nForty one percent of undocumented immigrants are from Asia from Asia a large majority of the link to undocumented immigrants from Sweden from Canada they aren't on that care of and I we label on the right point that out as always about brown and black [laughter]\nProblem is by the way I don't I don't want to make this clear it's the left that keeps focusing on the brown\nThe color of their skin or the fact that it would be Central American refugees and it's the left the dust it the right doesn't know know the right looks at it and the right to know either you're here legally or you're here\nIllegally that's how the majority of people look at it but they have to use it they have to do that\nThat's more Raj of an opinion comes from the left well the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians or your you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I've never met one conservative when it comes to illegal immigration that same will know let's let all the\n... all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America right over that\nNo my biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's not but you only ... only argument that they have is race so that's the only argument that they can use that can't defend it right and McCain got into sanctuary cities\nYou see how quiet they got ... they got quite because they understand what the the one thing that I think even though the ... that people in the media understand is that\nThose in power in the Democratic party actually do believe in open borders that's what they want they want open they won't reject open borders ... and so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign\nWent up to the whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive\nImmigration reform to anybody out there would be okay what we have to do is we get it would be ... to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for significant period of time right and you and I both often said\nShe if you make the offer just see what the response would be from the left if you said okay\nLet's give legal ... let's give ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrant that is but in this country since\nYesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally\n\nA must be sent back ... that we will give you everybody who is in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and what you think the response from the Democrats would be\nWell there's they're not they can't accept that the reason they can't accept that is because now they're at the point of wanting open borders it is not about that because\nEven they realized that the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill an agreement for that amnesty and then strong\nEnforcement or the borders will Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now we're still be people coming here illegally that will be here that will that will get here and stay here for five years ten years whatever it is and the argument doesn't\nChange so they know well forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want to have the borders at all come in and stay as long as you want [noise] I I have a\nChallenge to the Democratic party get together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always hear them say that ... but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still saying it I'd I'd forgot who just set a recently\nThe ... I burst out laughing but we need a comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include\nAnd be very fuzzy obese but be specific and tell me or at least give the state just the major stages of it that would be effective the major\nAffective stages of your reform plan what would they be\nI think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive immigration plan that you can go to specific\nA congressman and uh and and senators and state to them say what would what would you want in your comprehensive immigration plan and they ... they just wouldn't say comprehensive immigration plan\nSo we asked a question to the left why can't you tell us what's your comprehensive immigration plan would be is that a fair question right is that an outrageous question for us someone\nFor for for the two idiots overnight to ask right of any politician in Washington DC you keep saying comprehensive immigration reform tell us specifically what it would be give us the specifics and they won't do well why not\n\nBecause the leadership of the Democratic party wants open borders prove us wrong prove us wrong come up with a comprehensive immigration plan\nShow it to us and prove that we are wrong I Will be the first person to say okay I was wrong I Know I won't be wrong but [laughter] I'm wrong because there is your plan and you're going to stick behind it\nWell tell me one Democrat or a recently who is said and I mean at any one right now either running for office or that is in office that says and has been promoting\nWe here's what we here's what I think we should do\nAnd it would look like this we would have whatever it is amnesty and been border control because we've been asking the question okay fine what measure what measure of border control do you support\nRight what would your and now I I Want to correct this year there might be one senator non the Democrats' side there might be one senator that would give you\nA plant Joe Manchin yeah\nYeah maybe I ... I made I Want to be fair here and there might be one senator on the Democratic side could answer that would that would give\nYou even replant is even a Joe mansion saying anything right no\nNo no\nBecause the question is what is it really I mean the party has to promote it you're going to have to have the rest of the party obviously um and you know you're trying to get your trying to take control of setting you think you're going to win the house you've got momentum in the house you want to build momentum and the Senate races so\nHow do you do that what's the point what measure what level of enforcement do you support because really in my opinion\nIf I were answer answering there is no half measure and the problem with amnesty is that you're going to do it again later on it's gonna happen you're just saying okay a amnesty now\nAnd then there will be also amnesty later because we'll have the same debate and we'll still have the exact same scenario or Twenty years from now\nOr as a as a debate point yes that would be you bring that out as a debate point ... as a\nFind out what because the goal is to you're not to get legislation right the goal is to get out of Democrats what they truly think and what they truly want what the leadership of the Democrats\nWant we know you don't want a wall okay one level of enforcement do you support\nIs that an unfair question Danny Democrat is that an unfair question to ask your party leaders right and you think about it how can we have all this discussion on ... on immigration and illegal immigration\nThat's F.

doesn't matter and it really doesn't matter to anybody right now as we've said no one at one of the things you may be the you might be the most loyal Republican the most loyal Trump supporter\nA and supporting the Republican Party now\nSorry they don't care about the debt they don't care about the deficit and nobody does now it is gone caring for the the the the deficit and that\nGoes across whether you're a Trump supporter whether you're a Republican supporter whether you're never Trump conservative\nA few conservatives care about it but as you and I said Eric this this is how quickly this country has changed\nThat in twenty Fifteen the biggest\nIssue remember the establishment and the swamp were who where did that originally come from ... that originally came from the fact that when Paul Ryan became speaker of the house he would not go back and change the budget\nThat they had passed a banner had passed and there was theory and the the\nThe whole swamp was created out of the Republican leadership including Paul Ryan that would not control spending that's when you think about it that was one of the major points\nIn Trump setting himself apart from other Republicans\nThat he labeled them the swamp and said that's unacceptable we have to get spending out of control\nThat was three years ago\nWe had calls left and right we have to get the deficit under control that's why I'm going to vote for Trump that's not even a discussion anymore nope not nobody\nIs having that discussion anymore eight\nIs gone\nAs we said when you look at Congress right now you might have a what do we say half a senator or did we take on it would take to have some senator yes three eight of us right [laughter] 'cause even even even Rand Paul showed he couldn't do that right when it came to the um\nMedicaid right when it came to Medicaid spending in his own state and\nAnd so uh it's a ... it it doesn't matter anymore\nSo if there was ever a time for Democrats to roll this out all the free stuff it's now when the Republican Party\nDoesn't even care about deficit anymore and doesn't even care about that anymore Republicans don't care where Republicans don't care this has a much better chance over the next\nTwo years of the Democrats telling you weren't going to take care of view from birds mhm 'cause that's what it is right here from birth a thousand dollars in your account
