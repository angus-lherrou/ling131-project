that is set up it's a\nIt's it's a policy it's a list rules sort of set up by the government and its to control what paintball ... so of course corporations are people nobody was ever making that case it's the people inside that represent that company and their stock holders that had the same free speech rights as anybody else\nAnd and that's what the Supreme Court eventually you know had that you know it came out and said but that was her first attempt to get rid of freedom of speech we now know\nThat the ... we should get richer rid of freedom of speech and wishes to use the power of the government to punish you and destroy your life to do that ...\nWe know that I mean no that's not even debatable anymore when we talked about the first amendment we can look at freedom of religion and the bakery and artistic expression and all that that's going on right now and the left is again that individual rights\nOf I get to choose you know how I Wish to express a what I you know what I Believe so\nOften talked about the fact that the left does not and this is the mainstream of the law does not believe\nIn the first amendment they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion the second amendment it's obvious they don't believe in the second amendment they believe it's antiquated they don't believe in due process or under the law you and I've talked about this during\nAh during the uh uh uh during the whole uh uh uh a Ferguson case ... when you had a when you had a a Eric Holder and you had the president giving their opinion on it when they didn't know what happened right\nAnd we said you can't be doing that just shows you don't believe in due process under the law you can't be indicted unless you know\nYou've got to take each case individually if you're not then you don't believe in due process well we've seen this year the mindset of due process because what you did have heard was a political trial yes\nUh it wasn't they civil trial wasn't day it wasn't a a a a criminal trial\nBy many aspects of a real trial were there you're under oath mhm and you can be you can go to jail it was a legal setting it was illegal it's it's a legal maybe a political legal setting might not be a criminal trial or civil trial but it was a trial where many of the enforcement sort of trial\nA ... like when you testify if you commit perjury you can go to jail for that and they didn't believe in due process or under under the law they didn't believe in a presumption\nOf innocence none of that matter to them then we got to trumpeting the presidency and they didn't believe in the electoral college anymore now this one when you have a ... and this is this is going to pick up now because the oh wow we forgot the Senate\nOr that are now that the the the Senate has and we told you this was coming if you've been listening to show the last couple of years we told you the next thing they were going to try to get rid of was the Senate\nWell if you don't want the Senate if you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe with a ... and the presumption of innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about and we understand now on the show we believe that that\nThe majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though\nSo close to Seventy five percent does not but if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house\nOf representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in the house of commons you understand that the founding fathers of the United states they wanted\nA separation of powers the thing that they were most scared of was that a ... take care of her group a either\nA particular group of ... a a person\nA small group of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or presidency they were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas\nAnd they ... they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked\nAt the history of the world and seen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it and the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress\nAnd when you look at it the house of representatives or you have I think fifty three house members in California only one in Wyoming why bigger population and California fewer people in a ... in Wyoming both of\nTwo senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate\nAnd on and and by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years\nSo you're closer to the people are more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives would be closer to mob rural than a set of it [laughter] [laughter] but so they they but they wanted it they wanted the the the Congress\nTo be closer to the people small areas\nYou know of the country where you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state because if you had more population and a bigger state you had more representation in the house but they also wanted in every state wanted the ability\nTo have some kind of equal employed so the big states could not rule over the little state yeah that was the reason right the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why\nSeparation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yet but\nFounding fathers were worried so much about\nLegislation moving slowly through they preferred that then mob rule the reason the electoral college that exist today is so you can't have Marlboro or you can have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country\nWhere the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch ... it was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power cannot congregate in one area\nAnd as we said when it comes to the by camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house and then the Senate which is to push state which is six years\nSo they could be more long term looking at the country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years\nAnd the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country and not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents I'm most room of I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of I think most people\nI listen to our show do understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or tears to understand\nI don't think they care about it\nBecause what they want is again a and as they often engage in in fantasy that created in their mind a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy most often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way\nAnd you know it's interesting because you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you had people on the left you know the end at at at that point start talking about uh we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment now they're excuse the point of course directly to this president but it was about the same idea basic idea\nOf the second amendment and\nIt's often too little too late for the left\nFor something something changes well we didn't know what was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course change your way with the Senate completely\nWe didn't know we were going to happen but we got someone else was going to pay for it yeah well ... you start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is\nBurning your degree from one of

Ninety percent of sixty percent will win you a few elections and the point being is that we stepped back from\nThe insanity and the display the show that's being put on by the left here and the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying\nPeople aren't going to react to it or you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things\nIf they believe it's going to get them political points well it just might\nIn your state of Hawaii or California but if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is\nA not a ...\nAnalysis of facts like this is just my my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or a non political who have paid attention to this\nAnd even though they do sympathize and because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are of more ... a more conservative was\nIf you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation\nAll alone\nWithout cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nThen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling raping our society right well that kicked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what what's the thing that you always believe the woman you don't believe anything but evidence\nAnd to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark is ... ... most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent I bet you that other forty percent that so we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do\nWas just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or if Trump pick somebody they don't want him\nBut I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said\nNo you don't always believe the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe I always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always believe anybody it's the evidence that you make the judgment on and yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact their kids and being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or men or women don't tell the truth but it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans\nUnderstand that they understand\nBasic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democrat Party the mainstream of the party that are arguably\nHas more people supporting it mhm not by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote\nOr when they see that they say I don't really wished to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of and and and when you find out that you know the the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford\nIt was a Dianne Feinstein\nShame burn victim Chinese though one that wouldn't team the anonymity of the victim right it was the ... who leaked it it was the Democrats right it was either find Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman\nMhm right was it was ... or or her staff that said it had to be one of those two right\nAnd so when you look at it you all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of\nInnocence the stereotyping the bigotry all women all need to be believed all white men white men are white men can't and people look at this day and age and it's just like stomp it well I think\nYou two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this was recent history we don't have to go back and for the Democrats the sixties\nRecent history you have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand up for women called the women who voted for Trump self massaging is yep\nThey in fact the candidate herself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listen to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote and she was stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how to vote your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself what which he has it Democrats there to be believed\nOr not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage units which first they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nLiterally just re headlines right here uh San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins sociable for cat All right ah [laughter] ah critics blame white women the rap after Susan Collins of a ... a cabin up a speech\nYeah because we're amber was women women or were the oppress women were the victims in general until they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims they blame white women well I don't know\nDr forged genetic makeup or her her ethnicity background but she appears to be and a white\nWoman and and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to of victim\nYou will slander people you will defame people you will say that the presumption of innocence should not be part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed then you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do\nAnything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say there's a complete total lack of any type of fairness any type of ... it's the Democrats are were screaming for civility like McCain and as you and I said after the McCain's funeral we said by the way this week on Monday\n... this will be gone as soon as a hearing this was all completely gone and you've seen them taking it up to a level where there was a possibility if McCain was alive today ... he and Lindsey Graham would have stood side by side\nYes I could see a ... a John McCain after the behavior of the left in this process making the same type of comments that Lindsey Graham make eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nTax fund to seven nine six four or five\nThat's F.

[noise]\nFirst case was not credible\nYes\nSo ... would have come out first that might have been the first one and then ... would have been viewed as not credible because she couldn't remember the majority of the incident from that night except that was one hundred percent Brett Kavanaugh\nWell and I think that you you look at that uh like the the and again it and the court of\nPublic opinion when when we're forming opinions but it is often foreign through information that is a given to us by the media and and the people that represent anyone making the claims but if you look at the winds team cases right mhm what did we we started everything started to be corroborated through through\nUh the well not just the number of people coming forward and others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity pretend ultimately his own from that essentially had a page schedule find schedule\nBased on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught and and so there were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those planes that were nothing there\nAnd then Ramirez came forward and their war and then the third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her claim that case would have been hard for the president or Kavanaugh to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been face\nBut that didn't happen\n... elements ... were we and the only one that the only reason the Ford came out as because it was leaked yes\n... and so that it would not it was an all likelihood would have never come out if it had gone to the proper a judiciary a of way if it ... it but I find so I Would have taken it immediately and taken into Grassley then they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous said\nWhat and what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed you know and and they talk about how the ... story change how the sweat story changed but look at how the Ford story changed but what their point was on the political picture of being believable\nThe scenario that was that was their started with a he said or she said he said well then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one\nAnd realized it also changed and was falling apart what they what they were trying to point out here was she could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give them a Dr Ford\nOr to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned Collins making the or the you know talking about having that these role\nIn her speech but it does that happen\nAll of that happened because of what because the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nWhile you're in you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was her major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it must be ... and then you get a second and a third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point for it I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they're the ones that claim you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even that you know they're they're yeah they're ... you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't\nTrue yeah what is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listened to their voices ... yeah that's basically what you see except for the fact that it had greater\nSubstance en route and relevant to it I mean they ... they were right by the way uh in in in November of twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative helping to form those narratives along\nThe way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an Audi a stormy Daniels' case that and no one absolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair\nNo and\nAgain not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it but the let creates these narratives they give out and out of the\nThe the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim it must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it would have to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that right ... the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat is Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter]\nAnd Feinstein and what does he ever had a Democrat leadership nobody's calling for a primary challenger to him in the next\nElection nobody is criticizing Joe Manchin from the left at All right he's a Democrat wire their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that right exactly how come all the Republicans are taking the flag from the ... the left but the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh\nNot saying that no nothing nothing it's like to go back to West Virginia\nJust ... yeah I mean because because the reality of it I mean you know they they I I saw

next elections Susan ... ... ... runs ... says the woman who got on\nTV and lie and my wrist attack American please that's kind of credibility of the Democrats made and\nThen and then I thought to myself well wait a minute how many of these liberals on social media would vote for Susan Collins had she voted no on cabin off zero\nYou know it's this disingenuous well now we're going to challenge

only one won't crash journalist missing I Know a a princess the NTSB it's investigating what they are now saying it's the deadliest automobile accident in the U.S since two thousand nine and involved the limousine in a town about twenty miles west of Albany New York living twenty people Dead Sea captain bummer for Eighteen\nPeople who are inside the stretch SUV limousine including the drivers were killed when the limo failed to stop at an intersection and Harry according to New York state police first deputy superintendent Chris Fiore limousine\nI think if they live that way by the time the election rolls around four weeks from tomorrow\nThey may not be motivated to get out and it could be that an Avon Abby or you know Lanny Davis or any of them Who Lied about claims and and and indeed this along the way are not just in the confirmation process but the Wendy Davis thing with going\nCould be those factors that really on motivate those young people because keep in mind this is the same group that we've been talking about since twenty six team\nThat they don't care who you are you could have been on their side yesterday but today your there'll pressure or your the people that don't work for them that do that are no longer useful or who them\nKnow we we ... we saw this uh over the last couple of weeks which first off it was you know women are to believe be believed then it became well only some woman are to be bullied conservative woman are to be believed\nAnd then as you and I were talking about some of the stories that came out and some of the blame now being thrown at white women white women are the reason that you know a a cabin up ah was ah was confirmed and it gets back to what my friend a independent Bob\nCalled me and you know over the years now he has moved more during the\nBombing years he became more a ... he became more moderate Republican\nI Would say and in some cases even conservative I Am in a data that well maybe we shouldn't call them independent Bob anymore\nBut he still proclaims all the time that he's an independent right and when he called me be called me yesterday and and just said hey you could just he was so intense he said how could I ever vote for democratic get so how can I vote for\nAny party that tells me women are always right and white men are always wrong ... right he said white men are always right\n[laughter] and women\nAre not are going to be white men are always a wrong white men are always right oh women aren't always wrong women aren't only write your art always right you've got\nTo take it on a case by case basis you said I Know that he said everybody knows it and he's but he told me he said but I couldn't change anybody's mind on this because he was involved in a ton of social media debates\nAnd he was you know talking about his friends on the left that would stick to some of the new ... point that wouldn't even matter and I told him I said well look the point I'm looking at is not trying to convince them 'cause you're never going to convince them what you're trying to do is convince the the middle trying to convince people like you\nAnd I told him I said I remember you twelve Thirteen Years ago your look right now is completely\nCompletely different ah another family member of mine who was who was always more conservative but always said well it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats there\nOr was in a conversation with them over the weekend and I explained I said well you know what the Democrats did here as soon as I said that they just started going off and just said I Can't believe that I Can't believe they've gone to this\nTo this point and it's the mainstream of the Democrats it's not summer Iran\nAnd and he told me he said you know I always I always like it that you know I agree mostly what the Republicans but it's always good to have an opposition party there but he said what\nGood is that opposition party 'cause you know the Republicans don't always do the right thing\nHe said and sometimes I Need to be kept in check he said the who keeps them and check the Democrats ... ... the mainstream of the Democrats have gone crazy and I think that is the key here so when I look at a couple of weeks from now for weeks from now\nAnd and the election or I look at history and history shows the vast majority of times\nWhen you get to this point and you've got a Republican president you've got a Republican House you've got a Republican Senate in all likelihood the Republicans should Lucy yeah\nUh that's what history shows it's almost the same as when people called us up and and uh the one general number forget you remember the call to\nAbout a month before the election of ... he said you guys going to be surprised when Trump wins and said no we're not because history shows he should win based on the economy because the economy actually has been so bad and people have felt that and they view that there's a need for change\nSo you look at history and you'd think yeah now the Democrats should take now should they take enough seats\nTo actually take over the house I don't know but then you see the big huge on oh and that is the cabinet nomination\nI have I I still can't come up in my mind when the Republicans have been so United the only thing that comes to my mind is Nineteen Ninety four\nUh I'd only been in talk radio for five years and I remember Ninety four caught everybody off guard except for ... members ... threats as a result we became a poster yeah he ... he he came closest\nTo to catching what was actually happening now that was the United GOP at that point [laughter] just nobody knew that they were United [laughter]\nRight off to all go out go out and vote and were motivated at that point I had not seen a Republican Party that was as fractured as is Republican Party has bat and was in a period of two weeks\nIs a completely United party not because they love the leader of necessarily of the the party who would be the president not because they all of them a majority do\nBut it\nIt's because they had seen what the other party is and they look at the guy that they hate it just a little while ago and said\nYou know something he's not that bad I I I Wish you wouldn't say this I Wish you wouldn't treat this but these people when you see what they actually want you know they called Trump a fascist\nAnd at times I didn't like it 'cause I'd times I I'm speaking for me I'm speaking for never Trump hers\nYou know never Trump per se but you know he he talks authoritarian but even if he isn't and sometimes he sounds intolerant even if even if he isn't well then you see what the Democrats do when you say well actually this is what they mean right there is no nuance nuanced\nOpinions here to what they mean they don't believe in due process they don't believe in a presumption\nOf innocence they stereotype they say what you know and they stereotype to fit their particular narrative at the moment and we'll change a day later\nYeah it it's ... if you look at the I I think um where the Republicans have come together over two weeks over the last couple of weeks it's not even just the Kavanaugh nomination ended up itself or\nProtecting the process during the Supreme Court nomination even\nIt's not just Lindsey Graham and no and and and the things he said I mean part of it uh it it it's all of those and more it is but the bigger picture is including by the way columns you know and and her speech which got a lot of praise on on friday\nBut it really is you know the\nFact that I it it seems as if the party are saying yeah it's time to build a wall\nOr wall\nAround the party and what it really and four and a wall around the constitution to protect it each time that the party joined hands here and not that everybody has to agree on everything but there there has to be\nA greater respect and I think campaigning to go out and show what the and demonstrate clearly over and over again what the what the other side is doing and saying look we can all have our discussions on those issues within our house\nBut on the outside you need to know where the danger lies to you every single day and it is from this kind of behavior\nYou know the interesting thing is for all the accusations of being a fascist an authoritarian that have been leveled at Trump then maybe some never Trump ... bought into ... a majority Republican was ridiculous because he was and if you see if you see what he was about if you see the things that he loves\nIf you see the legislation that he's put into effect if you see his executive orders\nAnd what comes out of the White House about separation of powers in what they believe you know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief\nThat the Democrats truly are and it really hit when he realized it was the main stream\nIt was those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party that the mindset of authoritarianism and fascism that mindset that they were throwing a Trump\nActually belongs to their parties and they've had I only get shredded officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared some Republicans\n\nLook into any great business
