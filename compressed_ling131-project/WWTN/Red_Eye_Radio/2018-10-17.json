I Can't remember the head of the CIA guy\nUm if we don't prosecute these people for the crimes that they did\nA weirdo were no better than a third world or the third world country we're letting these people get away with what was wrong illegal unconstitutional and it basically all those things make a make America and the if\nIf we don't take the people who commit treason\nAnd prosecute them for that then they're going to keep their little following that they're going to walk around you got plenty of people out there that are saying that well you know ... evidently it wasn't that bad they didn't break the law they didn't do anything that was so evil and\nUm it it's [noise] I I just think that something needs to be done to show them and along with all that you know freezer assets because they're ill got games in the Clinton Foundation and I mean if we're going to go all out or go all lead on Kavanaugh for thirty five years ago\nI I'm sure we can find plenty of people and evidence for what Bill did back in the eighties so I mean why can't we go that route\nYou can and although someone challenged me and said what about the civil war right he committed uh certainly uh illegal acts at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff\nBut then on wartime this isn't war time this is it people who actually are saying\nThat the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy were fighting this is I have a different view on on the civil war than some people do I mean I I I understand that\nFor some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach with the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the bases\nThere were a lot of the items were fighting and all that okay go ahead no you know\nI was letting you finished grad\nOkay now but I mean that's so that's where I mean\nTo me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of states' rights to me that represents states' rights over slavery and when I talked to people and I've actually talked to people who have\nFlown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever that's what I asked him say okay now what does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with\nYou know states' rights and\nAn overreach from the federal government and the people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that then I just ... okay what makes you better than anybody else why why or\nWhy are you better then that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between\nAn old dove tail here the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are evidently irrelevant at this point and that is we engage in conversation we engage in discourse defend your defend your principles defend what your argument is they just want to shout you doubt\nThat want to call you names now that is not everybody in the Democratic party\nThat is why I I don't associate that with the Democratic party these are the left wing way out there which comes to who I Would actually have coffee with ... there's nobody really on the left politically\nThat I could sit down and have coffee ... however I have met George Clooney and she's a really nice guy and very humble and I I could sit down and have a beer at a cigar with him or something that would be cool [noise]\nYeah well I appreciate your answering tied the guys are not following\nRules yeah yeah well ... well it's okay\nWell there's there's nobody on the political left I wouldn't want to sit down and have except for ... somebody said Lieberman I I Would love to sit down and talk to labor that as far as people who I Would like to see yeah I I don't know how you set a oh who's who's running [noise] yeah [noise] what you well I I Know that there's somebody who's actually\nDiscussed running urge you get used to be a rising star who uh no longer I think it is a viable candidate that'd be Jerry Brown I'd love to see him run\n'em really who actually is boom ... love I Love oh I'd love to see him run oh I don't think\nThere's anybody out there that's going to be able to beat Trump\nI really don't and I think he's because he's got one a campaign under his belt for the presidency he knows a lot more one thing you can say about him he learns and uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons and I\nDon't think he's got to be he was a little I don't know if they saw off but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people that\nAnd I think this time he would really\nKind of be a little bit more aggressive and the way he would uh addressed anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up there because I think each I think you ... the same thing with Elizabeth Warren I think anybody from the left it gets out there he's got a pretty much ...\nI certainly agree with you he's gotten much more comfortable in the job he really has become much more presidential I think that's what you're saying he's really grown into the job and I Oh absolutely\nAnd and he does he's he's been doing really good on everybody's watching what the right hands doing\nActually I should say left him because he is science with those right everybody's watching what the left dance doing\nIt with his right hand he's just signing stuff sided scientists bond he's getting a lot done why everybody's talking about the rhetoric and looking at the ball bat sticking and um my my my fiance and I have been a friend it by several people that we went to school with them suffer because you can't talk politics with all\nThese are liberals they don't want it they can't defend their arguments they they don't want to talk about a policy it's just Trump pay send this it's like well we're where do you see that he hates well he just talks about me examples because all the hate that ice is coming out of the left\nAll the people that I was talking about hate or over here on this side that are represented the Democratic party and when somebody on the white quote right or the Republican Party that comes out spewing hate the Republican Party shouts them down and says no you don't represent the Republican Party David Duke there have been many many\nUh examples of people who have come out on the quote unquote right

state Mike Pompeo is on turkey this morning after meeting with Saudi leaders Tuesday to find out what happened to a Washington Post reporter believe will have been murdered by Saudi operatives in its demo\nMeanwhile some members of the Senate are ready to take action the Kenyan reports\nIt's a rare moment of bipartisanship for the U.S Senate following up into ... parts in fighting but the gas and Jim ... has tested the limit so what will the Senate Gail\nWhat I Would do I know what I'm gonna do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia\nThat Senator Lindsey Graham who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee this guy's got to go to ... speak in such stunning terms about Saudi Arabia is especially biting because gram has been one of that country's strongest defended\nOr Cory Booker is the fact that they said that I'm a black\nConservative don't speak for the black community and near where the conversation I Would have with them is that a ... that's not true because uh I think for the black community I'm a black bear every day\nAnd a numerous blacks have become conservative\nAs a result of me now is cussing or the uh topic with you with the um the issues with them and they become black wherever you oh I\nActually do and in fact no black conservatives are over twenty three percent which well so it's great so the fact that that's not when they say that black conservatives don't quote me for the black community where I Believe that uh\nI can sit down with Kamala or Cory Booker and have a decent conversation about that\nYeah I I don't know if they'd be open to it by the way I don't think it's twenty three percent because it was the Democrats will be finished because then they pull in like a Ninety Ninety One Ninety five percent depending on who it is so I don't think it's twenty three percent of what was actually\nActually there was a poll out just recently and said that it was over twenty\nOh really oh yeah yeah so\nUh it went up especially since Kanye West it's come out first time you came out it went up six percent and and uh the meeting last week it went up Twenty one or two so uh have you\nKnow I ... and ... I Can't write all the polling source right now but you know I I didn't bring that Whitney but it's going up that's a fat is definitely going up and everything\nLike you're in the I think you're I I think you're right but the problem is if the Democrats if you are even close to being right near the end of a their majority ever because oil high lax for granted I mean\nI I can talk to them by name the people that I talked to in the local community that they talk about uh that uh\nWe don't speak for that actually have be called conserve because anyway uh you know watch what you become conservative or liberal\nYou're still go ahead [laughter] so you know\nIt doesn't change their code what it does is they you know they were saying that doesn't have any validity you know I still\nI feel a ... it doesn't change the culture of a person because they think you know I feel like a a soul food I still listen to a motel style you know I can go on at all about the cultural things that I still do\nJust that different new on the different issues and the policy that I'd leave off for me it has nothing to do it any color and so I Believe so you can have a conversation with him based on that\nYeah I think you'd be good enough to have a civil conversation but I don't think priority Booker would be open to it and I don't think Kamala Harris be open to you have more faith in them than I Do but you know we all wanted us\nYeah well you're you know you want us to pick somebody that we thought that's ... ... and both of them say Kamala Harris and Cory Booker say if they write the president that we can sit down and have a civil conversation a friendly conversation we I think I\nKnow in fact I'm complaining you you're the only one to follow the rules and I'm complaining I have a lot of nerve you you did a good job you don't mind me and when you said your culture wouldn't change your culture wouldn't change you know when many\nBlack school to Africa and they think they're going there and they'll have something in common with the Africans but a lot of African people don't see them as black they see them as Americans and that's what they have in common and yeah well\nI have a lot of African plans are that are that have come over here a lot of them within the past five six year\nBecause I you know I Know a church or that I fell short with some time that are African and they say they're not African American they Americans now but they do that a real African American okay\nBut they don't even think that the African American and they say that their air so terrific yeah so anyway thank you very much maybe I can get part of that shit it's I really did all of the room and you weigh must mean all of the world\nThat's right I mean I'm I'm a possible but what I offer I don't even remember I I feel like Donald Trump is your name ...\n[laughter] oh oh oh\nI'm Sorry I'm Sorry to insult you okay right [laughter] yeah\nI mean that name the guy knows how to get publicity right the lawyer for a Stormy Daniels but a what a character ... I don't know if you saw it I actually watched it when he was debating a tougher Carson\nCarlson on Fox and and now with that one who was caught 'em all kinds of names and it was something else but the guy he's sleazy he really is a and a and you saw that was in the news that a Trump won that case and uh they're going to appeal now but whatever\nAll right so he was absolutely right and although I I miss it here I Am someone finally all the rules and I'm picking up no I was trying to say\nYou think that Cory Booker would sit down and you you follow the rules you write to pick someone you want to have coffee with what you think that guy was so full of himself that blow heart a Spartacus moment any made that up\nOr Kamala Harris it's so obvious what they're doing that just grandstanding and we're at the Kavanaugh hearings he didn't really care about that woman you'd think they ... I mean I Can't read people's ... motivations but it was about themselves it was packed getting power is about getting publicity because they're running for president\nI don't think they I I just I bet you they don't keep in touch with her\nIf you really cared about her maybe to keep in touch a little bit say how're you doing this was traumatic I don't believe in for a second\nWas about themselves\nAll right you know the rules of the game and even if you follow it it sounds like I'm going to pick on you let me so I think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine more guys are sitting in on right on the radio\nOne of the two areas of the country that is warmer than normal and dry at the moment is the south east to the other one the far west but agriculture department meteorologist Brad ... says the problem with warm and dry weather it could be a deadly one for the west\nAnd in Southern California in particular we've got low humidity levels have returned along with gusty winds coming from inland blowing offshore\nAnd everybody knows that means that we're moving into the Santa Ana fire season and certainly we have a a potential event going on right now in terms of welfare activity all the conditions are there and all it takes is a spark at this point to create great problems and speaking\nOf sports some Southern California power companies are reportedly shutting off power in some places to\nPrevent lines coming down on brush and trees\nWinds can bring the lines down one spark from lived cables and you've got a major fire in no time Gary Crawford for the U.S department of agriculture Washington\nThe USDA report is sponsored by cynics road master XL premium highway diesel fuel and shell road Tama\n[noise] ones over forty eight six six months he wrote our phone ringing [noise]\nDish HDTV keeping you connected coast to coast from a comfort of your guests to find out more does provide drug ... for my drug conduct gum\nWe all know the ones hardest starts it's that's why you need an ax ruby field master premium diesel fuel\nEspecially formulated was seven top quality additive injections stabilize or for better performance and less downtime and it's backed by agriculture is best for him to sleep better knowing you go next\nRuby field during the day so mean to sound pompous long enough to get some sleep with mind power alone centers around the edge of\nThe national debt is now over twenty million dollars what happens next rising inflation drops in the dollars value some experts say another crashes coming you can fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins and then I arrived from Augusta precious metals\nCoal eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and learn how an IRA backed by physical gold and silver can hedge against inflation calling us too precious metals right now any five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get a free gold Ira guy call eight five five eight five eight five eight oh seven\nReserve is ... almost half\nOf all drivers vent an hour or more for parking it's easy to spend hard earned dollars at a time and few searching for that elusive spot in his press a safe\nPlace to park is something you should have to worry about reserve it can reserve is sponsored the smart ... reservists parking money at the center now pay for parts with older one point in the open when we're in a\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most red wrecking news\nNow every week and watch me and my co host younger grows as we bring\nYou the only weekly news show green and just joined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile\nTrucker dot com is the one you're not going to want to have them busy travel down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel my going to the front of the dot com\nLike a girl is a nonpartisan hot it's a documentary on the number of women running for office in the mid term election [noise]\nLearn more about the w._b. carry business graduate programs online\nTax fund to seven nine six four or five\nThat's F.
