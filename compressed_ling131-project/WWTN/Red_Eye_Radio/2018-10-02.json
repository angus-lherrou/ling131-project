investigation that's the FBI reviews on locations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh course rather dramatically explains the cross\nA White House has to order it in the early ... interviews does actually you mentioned information back to the White House the White House in the city so how's the Supreme Court nomination will have access to that information\nAt and and it's a it's a good message you will convince the independence and that's what we've always stayed and we've always received Robert The response but you can't given separately buddy were not attempting to convince everybody that that's the wrong premise you're not attempting to convince\nEveryone the poll found that even if uh he ... the the FBI comes out and finds no cooperation sixty percent of Democrats still don't want him confirmed right well dug\n\nIt can be it could be Mother Teresa alive and and they would still not want him to be a confirmed the point is a ... is the evidence there to make her testimony credible and it absolutely\nIs not and that's the message that you need to get about you know you need to get across and there needs to be a consistent message there you go to social media and the questions are being asked are just are just bizarre and if you look\nShow with us and when you look at what ah ah for example the the the uh uh a Yale\nI'm of the first and went to Yale with a glass happened other classmates and you know and she came across instead of if you only get said this and then you look at his testimony well he did say that they're actually to the point now where the liberals this is how bad is you're asking will they ever get off the brink more to the\nPoint where they're making an accusation he's line really yes he should've said this well he did see he's line no but you said if you said this wouldn't be line nobody's line but he said this\nI mean that's where we are right and it carries the exam media gives it life because here's here's the difference\nIf you look at the case of the New York times talking about the the ah the accusations made in the New Yorker piece they\nThis is what they wanted to do they want to do their their their tactic on this story this claim was to go find an interview as many people as possible to see if they had first hand knowledge of this happening they couldn't find one NBC goes out and says\nWell we couldn't find anybody to back it up but we're going to put her on anyway ... classmate\nActually makes a statement that parallels what Kavanaugh said and said if you said those then I wouldn't have a problem but still the media carries story because what you're looking to do is if I were writing that story if it were my work\nTo put that story into print or put it on TV or anywhere else\nIt would be my approach to say uh this\nIs going to be torn to shreds because what she said and I need to go back over to this is what I Would do I would get the transcript and I would read it and read it again because she's claiming the classmate is claiming\nHe didn't say something when he did it's an all out lie but if you're in the media and you're taking that story to print to TV to whatever\nYou're part of the lie because it took another media organization to tear it down and say well I'm actually he did say that or does it ever feel like that\nAnd and and this does not come from arrogance whatsoever because you know that we refer to ourselves as a two idiots overnight\nBut does anyone ever get the feeling and assist those doesn't include just you and me are but everybody listening right there does it ever get to the point where you just think to yourself dealing with the Democrats right now the mainstream Democrats\nIs like dealing with our children yes and the excuses the children will give yeah and I'm not saying that are out of meanness I'm Talking about the arguments that they are making you know you and I said this\nUh last week said the American people when you basically they understand due process\nAnd if you talk about the due process and what the Democrats are doing here and not you know the belief and\nYou know that you're innocent until proven guilty but the fact of what they used to claim they cared about ... you know that's what the liberals are to care about\nAnd the fact they don't and I said but if you keep pushing it the majority of Americans do believe in that even Democrats who say they won't vote for cabinet they still view this as a cheap shot against him yes they view it as if you if you get them alone and you ask them\nThey'll tell you that oh by the way one of the uh\nUh people that I Know on social media that ah doesn't talk much used to talk more as a liberal\nAnd has been quiet over the last year came out in favor of Kavanaugh [laughter] wow and ended in a very subtle way and I was like wow but if you actually talk to Democrats right now they're not happy with the way that the ... the the this is actually going\nOr they won't come out publicly and criticize their party for what they're doing but they feel very uncomfortable they understand there is no evidence here they understand and then they see this just rolling and ... and that's the whole point that many Republicans look at this and go wow are you kidding me they're going down this path\nAnd now they're they're just taking anonymous sources and throwing it out I mean this is just so slimy and so dirty yeah or against Kavanaugh because there is no cooperating evidence there is no evidence\nAnd look people aren't stupid\nThey will sit there and say this really stinks well and that's that's it because it does that look at the forward and say all these go find me accounts another now of what a million or over a million dollars\nWhat are the world's going on here the lawyers for pro bono you're talking about an airplane flight ... was all this money being\nA rate it looked dirty yes it all looks dirty and the American public and that's why when you bring it up about the cooperation and when people actually look into it and you know when you said earlier to me uh off the air\nYou said this is really liked the experience that we have when Capra Nick but yeah we have no idea the cap regular it's about free speech or why aren't you watch the new well look I'm not angry it's just I don't prefer to watch it because of\nAnd you explain what he actually did and you explained the pigs socks every single\nPerson that supported Kaepernick had no that that I've talked to and it's in the hundreds over the last year mhm had no idea about the top ... once you bring that up to go it's a good point they had no idea about Michael Bennet ... no idea that Michael Bennett who was the catalyst one of the catalysts last year and just become one of the leaders\nOf the movement who was also you know in the locker room yesterday for Philly ... got famous and became the poster person last year mhm to continue with because he lied about the Las Vegas police every single person that was supporting cap and I didn't know about that either\nAnd they went oh okay yeah that is bad\nAnd I'll leave it at that I won't judge them and but you can tell they know when you bring up things that are common sense to people when you bring up something like fairness\nAnd the\nPreponderance of evidence before finding somebody guilty that it has to exist somewhere there's a reason\nThat NBC wouldn't run Mitchell's report why wouldn't they run it\nBecause\nThey know that even there are a few listeners there doesn't listeners viewers that that are left even if they're liberal would say\nYeah that's not good right and\nWhy do you do that to adults why don't you want adults to know the truth right why we don't hide anything on the show there's nothing I Would hide\nAny news item I could care less I'll bring up anything that's going on out there why won't say right why will they hide things that are important\nTo a story and even if they disagree with it analyze it right but they they as we've talked about before we talked last week about lying through omission mhm in a lot of stories out there now right but if you live through omission we just won't include parts of it and if and while\nThey'll give an interview to somebody who's making claims that they as a news organization couldn't even corroborate right they will ignore\nA key piece to the actual an official piece of the actual procedure the actual process in place they ignore it completely\nBut when you give Americans when you start telling Americans will look here's what's going on with this case and you lay it out to them that's why all of a sudden you go to\nYou know sixty percent say oh or fifty seven percent say oh we didn't know okay yeah that that's that's wrong if there is no cooperation\nWell and if the FBI finds out there's no one sixty percent of Americans believe that that's almost all of independence and yeah and that's what you're looking for that's what you're looking for in any election and we always\nGet this and we talked about the administration and said look you could have more success is if you have a consistent solid message day in and day out because well you never convince the liberals that's not your ...\nYour goal and and you know it's like Jeff Flake saying you know what I'm saying when I went to Coons I I was just I was telling them this is tearing our country apart we have to we have to do something well who's responsible for the damage right you're going to the person that's tearing

the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric\nYou mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused instead Eric ... uh but as you said yesterday\nA ... and you and I've been doing some some uh uh reading an analysis\nOn this is that her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do the looking to buy used vehicles yes and that's driving the market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles the used vehicles then the price goes up\nAnd so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal it's all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president and things because of president or even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things ... and that's one of the bad things as automobile now it could have been a lot worse than what he was promoting before\nBut the fact is it didn't affect probably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing\nAs we said what happened we had predicted look who's going to be all this hype all the soup law and what we're going to basically get is the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory and timber we get a little victory and dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that year the consumer are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship\nCars from the United states anywhere else and the president views that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I I think if you look here's where the child will be you'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry has\nHis key to the economy is because you look at the the the how often now people purchase vehicles right or more and more they're holding on to their cars\nSo that hurts the ... because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be salt you make that more expensive you start hurting it industry\nYou start seeing layoffs as a result of that then and then also make the used cars by default\nMore expensive and you're going to see not just the automobile industry but of course all the dealerships\nAnd all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms of those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that because people will choose\nAs they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time because that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else we're not talking about well\nWhether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce that it's hard to come by it that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine how expensive it's going to be for us\nThat's the difference and we view it as a victory\nAnd as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stuff where we do have more free trade now because of it\nAnd we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine but it's almost as if we make the victory over there and then we shoot ourselves in the foot on automobiles now the other good thing is\nCanada will like this will be was mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the terror if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether\nA candidate is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction\nIn the United states because that timber will be coming over\nAnd that was a fear of builders that housing prices were going to skyrocket another construction from the use of of would because of the Canadian timber and hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and losses across the board but but overall if the president is stating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs in the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it\nWell and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles\nAnd you start seeing that slide you start seeing the economy slide then that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel chairs they saw companies leaving the country and they said that this can't stand\nWe cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this\nBecause the the job loss\nWill be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those steel terrorists uh prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right and so uh you know the President Bush was called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economic slump he gives\nMe when you get ... just got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China there's ... then ... and by the way political you can get away with that all day long to it's going to it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by\nThe world Trade Organization rules then not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with China need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy\nAnd it is going it it has to be effective because I don't know how you can put a cost on on China not playing by the rules and stealing intellectual property time and time again and getting away with\nEight six six Ninety why\n[noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shell row tell a

will keep them from becoming a judge forty five years from now but my point is that Senator Flake man actually ... the Republican Party by calling for this investigation here senator in a a\nPurple shall we say state or a state where your reelection is a tough one\nA year now and say hey look I was kind of go towards not voting for the man or I was leaning towards voted for him\nI wasn't sure I sat through the hearings\nAnd like so many Americans I couldn't make up I Am I what we call them the FBI they did a full investigation and any reasonable person would say that there is no conclusion after that investigation I'm going to vote for him so I think that's that's the case she gives some cover to Republicans\nWho may have been afraid to alienate some of their female or [noise] boaters and gives them a little political cover to vote yes\nWell this only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days that by the week by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them that the but more importantly those senators in those states especially where it's close\nOr are not getting the support of their voters and they're staged a and ultimately it only works if the vote is to confirm Kavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans\nIf he does not get confirmed or it becomes still a very very much so an uphill battle or even in November even though I Do believe that this whether he's confirmed or not will work for them politically I don't know too what effect in November at the ...\nAnd I think the Democrats plant is it doesn't really matter what happens with Ford anymore it's let's get at whatever other allegations that we have to try to delaying that's yet they want yeah yeah\nThey

princess two Republican senators have called the White House the stress that they expect a complete investigation as the FBI reviews on vacations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\n... both Blinder reports comprehensive but quick that's what the president wants from the FBI investigation during a news conference in the rose garden the president indicated he's fine with the sexual assault investigation following whatever leader turned up\nI think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer\nBut with yesterday start of the new term for the Supreme Court the president also doesn't want the investigation to drag on the president also says he has no problem with the FBI interviewing all three of the women who have accused Kavanaugh Jerry ... at the White House\nAnd never asking these specific question you know based on the evidence that exist let's lay out the entire case in front of the American people and then see how they think don't ask one specific question because the question is not whether you were ... were you know whether whether you believe that\nA a Ford is credible there's no way I Know whether she's credible or would achieve seem credible I don't know what seeming credible means\nAll I can look at it say okay\nThe what does she have to say and doesn't match up with the evidence what does she have to say it doesn't match up with what she said yesterday what did she say oh she has witnessed as one of those witnesses say oh they say the opposite of what she said\nOkay it's not just what she said it's everything and all the evidence surrounding it that makes you credible or not credible and so when you have a particular amount of evidence out there if you come across\nAs credible because the evidence backs you up yeah you can add to the credibility of it\nAs a person but you yourself just speaking alone with nothing else around you\nAnd when your statements contradict\nPrevious statements and when your witnesses that you\nEven friends say don't know what you're talking about you lose credibility so what they did was they went out the Harvard Harris survey and ask people uh you know what that what do you think once they tell them that the three name witnesses\nThat she picked that she said\nA word there said don't know what you're talking about ... didn't didn't happen that way when you do that it changes a fifty seven percent\nOf of uh people were arrested here\nI'm\nFifty seven percent of people believe capital K they they don't believe the allegations than when ... ... you know what that and if the FBI finds nothing sixty percent believe you should be confirmed\nThe point we want to bring up as whenever we have a debate people call us and say well you guys you're never going to convince every body that's not the point the point is never to convince everybody in the political process in this country where you are roughly have forty percent Republican forty percent\nAh a Democrat in the twenty percent in between\nAnd when you get up to sixty percent you convince the majority of independence and that's how you win elections you make the case you stick to common sense you stick to critical thinking and you'll still be able to get the majority of Americans to agree with you except for the national debt\nMhm\nAh so there you go they found the people that when people are told a the three of the three name what this does not cooperate the accusations of a doctor forward opinion shifts decisively in Kavanaugh's favor as a daily wire reported on Monday polls by you govern writer's father people largely believe what benefits they're affiliated party\nMore than two thirds of Democrats believe the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh while roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not overall you God found that forty one percent believe for thirty five percent believe Kavanaugh Reuters found forty two percent belief forward\nAnd thirty one percent believe cabinet or Harris Poll chair Mark Penn a former Bill Clinton pulse to report in Sunday that the Harris Poll study found that forty percent who saw or read parts of the testimony\nLast Thursday felt that Ford alone seem credible wall twenty three percent said Kevin all alone seem credible that means just themselves without\nAnything else no evidence surrounded by a total of twenty seven percent so they both seem believable does sixty seven percent\nOf the of the total felt that Ford was credible fifty percent uh felt cabinet was credible so there you go sixty seven fifty\nOr the Harris Poll study really gets interesting\nAnd its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation\nAnd on the issue of cooperation the credibility of the testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor writes Penn ... rather the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion\nOn whether Kavanaugh should've sent to the highest court when the response we're told the three name witnesses did not cooperate Ford's claim fifty seven percent said they were in favor of his confirmation if the FBI fines no cooperation of Ford's claims sixty percent said Kavanaugh should be confirmed penned reports so there you go\nAs we shut all the time it gets down to the evidence we stayed at from the very very beginning and that's why what the Democrats are selling independence aren't\nBuying anybody who has an out some critical thinking understands the presumption of innocence even in a study in like this the Democrats tried for a short time to use the\nThe uh uh the phrase well ah this was on a court of law it's a job interview yeah Americans understand the fairness and number one most job interviews do not have an\nFBI investigation by the way only only certain jobs this is an appointment to a branch of government\nAnd it is one political party not just your employer is a political party trying to defend the character\nOf that long term federal judge\nOr who has been nominated to this particular job Americans understand that they tried to use it for a short time in and that really didn't work because Americans understand it unless\nYou are a part as you look at this and you say sorry not enough here and that's why a you know the the Harvard poll Harris Poll that Mark Penn talk to me indicates what America really thinks\nAnd it shows that the Democrats are convincing anybody other than themselves well\nAnd and and that's that's it but when this is the this is the I guess downside for them of the media carrying their stories and their narrative\nIs that\nIt makes a lot of people feel like well I don't know she's going to win the election\nIt makes a lot of people feel like it's going to go this way or that the reality is this when it's often not because the willful ignorance drives all of this\nPeople that are very ... in fact clear about staying away from the actual details of the story will also make a decision\nAnd in a situation like this we have to be reminded that that's how political pressure is built\nWell\nIf you start asking questions and pointing out the details\nAnd they only have to really be informed of ... but just a really short list of those details the opinion start to to to change to the point that there is no political pressure against the Republicans in the vote for\nCapital I I think I can safely say this I Believe that out of all the determining factor of how people make their opinions and there may be ten different factors\nI think the leading won the the leading factor of people are making you know that that making their opinions is ignorance mhm I really do yeah because uh we we deal with it every day on the air I've been in this down as I as I've said a few times\nBecause there was you know I don't know what they exactly it is this week but it's the first week of October\nTwenty nine years and talk radio and and the number one that we don't debate anymore we don't debate issues we debate with people that don't have the facts behind them that's all we do\nI mean that's Ninety nine percent of what we do yeah uh when when we had when we confront somebody at the opposite opinion I mean we do spend a lot of time\nYou know ... ourselves doing it but when we confront somebody who was a different opinion with us\nThe vast majority of the time is spent\nTelling them no you don't even know
