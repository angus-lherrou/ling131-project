Chuck Grassley sent a letter to Dr ... were were question more information specifically rationally wants the therapist notes all audio or video recordings produce during the course\nOf the polygraph examination of Dr Ford all written audio visual or um\nAny information given to a reporter or anybody else at a media organization\nA\nAnd has said that some of the material has been passed on to a national circulated newspaper or not provided to the Senate and he proposes a a proposes to suggest a ... a lack of candor\nAdjacent to those request is a curious paragraph this National Review the full details of Dr Ford polygraph are particularly important because the Senate Judiciary committee\nHas received a sworn statement from a long time ... doctor forge\nA sworn statement he's been under oath now ... stadium that he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations when asked under oath in the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph\nDr Ford replied never the statement racist specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination result she continued the Senate therefore needs this information it'll be interesting well they give it to or\nA is gradually using this as the defense that when they don't\nThen they can expect to send it to delay it any further right right and or make any other choice\nIn terms of the vote because I think this is clearly by the chairman yeah I think this is\nWell it works in in on both levels they handed over a new review it or they don't hand it over and you essentially look at the you you send it on to the Senate majority leader and say well we've done our due diligence\nBecause if you're looking for and looking at evidence and and you can't get any other witnesses to back up what she's saying\nWhat you want to see is All right what was the process especially with\nThe uh any video or audio that was recorded during the polygraph\n... you know they they ask for that before the hearing\nThey asked for that ah the weekend before\nThe ... the hearing a couple of weekends ago and her attorney basically said no it's not relevant of course that's relevant because you say that she took and passed a polygraph test\nWell we need to see the methodology and the polygraph test\nTo see that you know what questions were asked\nUm and and again how the how the process on that level of work I think that's fair\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate yep you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't and and nobody above it I'm sure somebody's brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used in say these the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else to take a polygraph test you know in in you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating\nNope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes because she is using the she is using the polygraph\nAs cooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify that the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nOr life with Dr Sam ... book [noise]\nLet's get right to

said was uh that uh\nUh these these Democrats are saying all this you know they're not only democratic as they're not on the credit wiping rhinos or Ronald to report ... well he's ... he's a conservative or they should yeah he's a conservative okay well then you're talking about something different but but these are mainstream Democrat ...\nOr the day these are the Democrats are today

say then I'd be okay with it but he did say that right and so you're trying to determine\nThe level of intoxication of somebody thirty six years ago right and since we now have a society that gets high instead of drinking mhm since that seems to be the direction we're going that's like saying\nHow high was the yeah I was pretty high no dude you were just really stone that's perjury\nSee thinking about it I mean there's a thing you know by the left standard he could say if it were about\nPot he could say well he he tried it with but he didn't inhale [noise] that would be\nPut on ...

as there is no incident to how drunk you were one specific time it's in general in your whole life right and in pretty wasted in times how wasted really wasted I think you were mega wasted\nYeah you're you're committed perjury you said really way said you were making whites said oh yeah and\nSo I'm doing five years for perjury in prison for what and I said I was really wasted and they\nBelieve the guy that said I was mega wasted what's the difference was like the TSA bus driving is drunk driving and then of course the drunk sitting in front of the TV Now is not set up it's not\nBut it it well I don't even though the by ... the ... the entire thing is is if technically ... you know what to do a whole 'cause this is how I think of when I see the bus driving ... wait a minute if I'm at point oh five ... and I feel a bus and I feel about ... it is and drunk driving\nNot by the my state standard right\nYes not by not yes not by the state standard I I don't think anybody's below point away\nI don't know that anybody right as I think they're trying to move something was there was a movement or or call to move it to point oh four right which would be okay bus driving can impair your you know your ability your skills behind the wheel that's\nWhat you could but you could leave it you could look at that and say well do do you ever charged with drunk driving ... uh uh and I I guess I'm I'm trying to think it would be the scenario but your point let's say let's say your name is bad too\n\nAnd the cops pull you over I bet you don't run you didn't run when you did [laughter]\nYeah you have a much better scenario then but I could come up with yeah thank you very much I don't think they are out of thin air just out of nowhere\nTo have a\nBuddy by the way we think about the ... with with ... that the the critique or whatever the review he gave it up some performance where he talked about\nYou know some dance performance you talked about why the

the department trying to make on perjury is the fact that hers is about a specific behavior that can be measured did your did you not tell somebody you said no we gotta witnesses said you did now do they find that\nWoman ... oh that would be the next step right and they would find the woman mhm yeah now she doesn't have to testify\nNo no way to make the Senate can subpoena you can't yeah well and I think they want to do another hearing yeah yeah\nBut that'd be an ... that somebody you know he's new and it's come aboard will the FBI interviewing him and then they have the name of the woman they know the name of the woman that she helped\nHer name appears [noise] I I I don't know because it depends on really they they were given a broader scope on Monday\nThe president or maybe it actually officially happened late Sunday\nThe president broadening the scope you know to being able to interview anybody on anything that was that was tied to those claims but\nI don't know if it's not necessarily something that that she said in a ... that would be the investigation I'm Sorry the background check a would be would include that which is something she claimed\nYeah they have the name ... Senate McLean so I'm sure he's given the investigators her full name right and if she's alive I'm assuming\nThat\nYou know you wouldn't ... somebody in the Judiciary Committee if they're saying when any further if they're going to stick with her as this witness and the Democrats are going to stick by this and Republicans are going to stick by the next thing would be to get her and then if you had the boy the you had the boyfriend in his testimony\nAnd then the woman that she actually helped with the lie detector if she helped or the alleged helping limit the lie detector test if she comes horn says yes she helped me with a lie detector test you got her Mm\n\nWell here's my question to on asking for the materials that Grassley asked for by the way on the the video or audio related to or or of the process of the lie detector test\n\nHe's asked for that before my question is if the Senate committee officially asks her for that because that really was that was presented as evidence\n\nExcept for they didn't get to scrutinize the\nMethodology of it it was just the results right the results being presented as part of the evidence will now that she has testified in front of the Senate because at first Grassley asked it before she testified\nBut is there does the Senate have the power to subpoena\nThose those are\nThose documents that information\nI mean is it binding legally I guess is my question now that she's testified because that's where the official claim\nWhy most fainting spells are benign cardiologist Dr ... says there are times when fainting is more concerning that includes people with known heart conditions and\nSomebody has chest pain ...

[laughter] [laughter] I just have a bunch of Democrats that this is what we need I Would love to see that\nLet's hire a bunch of Democrats and liberals to be on the field during each kick this can be a new rule and when they kick if it looks like it's not they get they get a chance to correct it by moving the goalpost\nThey're good at it\nI'm going to play this audio cut here this is a Senator Tom cotton talking to Tucker Carlson okay are actually two nights ago but it's important here uh we didn't get chess late last night uh we didn't have the audio at the time but I Want to play it as he talks about where this is where we are at this point\nSoccer that's pretty one sided down here that army have started to get a lot bigger if they're going to take me on because it's very easy to defend judge Kavanaugh yet it has a stellar record on the bench yeah they long and distinguished history of public service has undergone six background checks tougher\nSix background checks and that somehow the FBI is supposed to turn off new information in just a few days\nTo satisfy all the Democrats yet as soon as we agree to have a limited investigation by the FBI and the current credible allegations of which I Would say there are no but the humor them to give them a few days and they immediately started moving the goalposts saying that we have to interview two dozen witnesses have to take weeks and on and on and on\nIt's never going to enter this is not about trying to get the facts or get the proof\nIt's about trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed for the Supreme

is not even up for debate it's all about his high school yearbook does it strike in this conversation is on the coming of a country as advanced as ours it's just so stupid finally\nDumb why it is it

that's where we are I Wonder how much you know talk today we only had\nA boat one call today with very few ... this week we've been doing this for a long time as I said this is my ... this week marks my twenty ninth you're on TALK radio ... we know when the Democrats have an argument or when they believed to have an argument we know Democrats don't have an argument and they don't believe that they
