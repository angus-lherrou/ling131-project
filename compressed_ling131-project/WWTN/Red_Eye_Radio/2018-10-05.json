up an allegation\n\nIs required and there's a responsibility I Believe of every American to ensure that that is the way the process is held up whether it's in the arena of political ideas\nThat may not be the criminal justice system but it's the same responsibility that people have not been defame other people's character for their own immediate political want and the the some of the arguments that\nYou've heard what one of the younger and so I thought was the beauty\nWell are they um they they started with the Merrick Garland\nOr because they they they they would nominate him so Republicans got what they deserved yeah excuse me this is something that has been talked about for a long time\nChuck Schumer brought it up back in two thousand nine ... when he said in an election year no and and Bush or should be able to Bush no was it was before two thousand nine\nOr because it was it had to be during Bush it'd be during the Bush was before two thousand nine but Schumer brought it up a during the Bush administration went and just just a ... in case one of the Supreme Court justices died said we should not be the the policy of the Senate\nTo nominate a a Supreme Court justice during a presidential election year right by the way the stink wasn't as big it was for a little bit and then people realize oh Hillary is going to kill Trump so we don't have to worry about it we'll just get it afterwards but delaying a nomination\nThat has been an idea that both Democrats and Republicans have been promoted for a couple of months to allow the next president\nWho all the polls and all the Democrats thought would be Hillary Clinton is not the same as deep fame mean a person's\nCharacter by calling them calling that person a gang rapist a sexual assault tour without any evidence besides an allegation\nWhich the witnesses that the people that brought those allegations about their witnesses could not cooperated\nAnd in the case of Dr Ford who claimed she has the evidence that would cooperate it\nShe refuses to give it to the body that would make that decision which is the Senate Judiciary committee so to make that case I mean that's probably\nThe strongest argument which is a weak\nArgument that I heard was will soon so I held the Garland murder girl Israel they deserved it what do you mean that was done through the majority leader stadium nope we got the majority\nMhm but ah we'll\nHold it even if we have the majority after the next president does elect right irrespective of whether it's a Democrat or Republican that's the same as the fame ing and destroying somebody's life right\nWith allegations that are not provable\nI didn't see any attacks on Merrick Garland none\nAnd so everything that you know every allegation that has been brought up\nIs suspect mhm\nAh because the witnesses that they brought forward could not cooperate it right the things that they said changed that the the the alleged victims claimed changed as we went along\nAnd that's what we go by in our system whether it's the political whether it's political justice whether it's civil justice or whether it's criminal justice the presumption vivid evidence and the fact that an allegation and stop and think about it the protesters right now that you saw yesterday and you're going to see all day again today\nThat may get arrested again today and there may be you know ... thousands more who knows\nThey're saying believe the survivors which means you always believe the accuser will do they believe that no we all know they don't know we all know that's all just are dying you believe the accuser if they're on our political side\nThis is the social media or approach now to ah to activists or activism\nIt's exactly what you see on social media we don't we talk about the fact that real people don't live their lives like you know people are act on social media we talk about that a lot\nWell the people who are activists far left trolls\nAnd celebrities do they live in a virtual world will celebrities live in a virtual world\nThat's what they do for a living anyway there immersed in it I mean it is not for them that's nothing different you just live the fantasy and the family fantasy is whatever it is whatever whatever you say it is because you have a blank canvass\nThat's exactly how they think that's how they act what you're seeing here is social social media type activism taken to the street\nThat\nDoesn't happen to be backed up by anything I posted it therefore it's real I say it therefore it's true doesn't work\nThat way you know in the real world friday so overall when we look at the last two weeks and who knows what the vote will be this weekend I I I don't know I mean I haven't seen any\nA count yet um and I guess we we will see right and we will know when we come back in Sunday night Monday morning all I Know it was for the last two weeks of covering this\nUh there's not been an issue where there's been more passion since the election but I have not seen this type of unity\nIn the Republican Party and think about it think about what it would take I mean I I didn't think that you would see the unity in the Republican Party this soon and it's solid right now because I think they now see\nThat whatever their differences are with Donald Trump whatever ear or ... whatever irritate them\nAbout the the the president whatever they find unacceptable about the president and I'm Talking about the never Trump or is a lot of Republican conservative\nThey look at it and they finally have come home why because they look than they've said these people are political\nIs in saying that things that we hold so dearly\n\nWith you on a Mayo Clinic radio health minute I knew the in Williams\nSo you're talking about weapons

Camille paleo for example ... an old school a ... ... you know liberal on one of those who but as as we did a few years ago said uh excuse me the whole transgender thing\nOr he left you better understand that if you do this\nYou're gonna have feminist ... soon you're going to be fighting feminist and the transgender activist\nBecause you can't have you can't have feminism if a man can be a woman right if a man can be a woman if anybody can be a woman just by saying man can be a woman by saying so feminism is doomed and you know she was one of the ones that first came out\nYou know after after because we'd set of years ago but she also came out and and and stated that and so I really think that you know you look at the old school liberal she's one of them ... which is another one of them we may disagree on the role of ah like like a John Adams and and Thomas Jefferson\nThe role of the centralized federal government the debate that's been going on for over two hundred and forty years\nShould it be big should it be more encompassing or should it be smaller still though that debate encompasses all the right in the bill of rights and the constitution it doesn't reject in say freedom of speech\nJust gone ... Second Amendment rights are are gone due process rights don't matter anymore a presumption of innocence doesn't matter because of our politics know the old school liberal didn't believe\nIn a bigger centralized government but they wanted they ... they even with the big central government they still want it especially\nThe bill of rights was sacred to them and it no longer is but here's what's talking about Cory Booker standing doesn't matter whether is innocent or whether he's guilty\nIt's just these so many allegations that he needs to step down here's a response\nDancing professor that that's a fire than it doesn't matter whether is innocent and guilty he shouldn't\nJust ... well it sounds very familiar when I was in college that's what they said about people who are accused living communist yes as a matter of there and and the guilty if somebody is accused me of being a communist\nAnd you angrily responded and said you're not then hey you don't have the temperament to have the job\nAnd it's just a job interview if you're getting fired for being a professor after forty years and what's the difference if you're innocent or guilty somebody said you're a communist this goes all the way back to the inquisition when they would call you in first and make you testify and then they present\nThe evidence ... once you're accused of the most heinous crime imaginable\nIt turns into a trial where you have due process where the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing\nIn America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations in careers based on it for instance guilt away the ACLU NASA as he is he'll use it as we should presumed guilt not presume in is that\nFor a hundred years defending their process us exactly what they're saying so you're a liberal you have lived her life in a liberal world Martha's Vineyard Keno liberals to them ever say look I don't agree with Kavanaugh hate prompts but I agree with you that to process is worth preserving other with also feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent saying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by a liberal president who has been accused into it acted similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like and you know there's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship [laughter] the opposite was happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship\nAnd I think the premise of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I have great\nYeah\nI ... and ... and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know it's it's telling that we're at\nThis point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "05"}
