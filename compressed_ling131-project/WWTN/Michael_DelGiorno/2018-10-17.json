need that noise just to make sure that\nYou know I don't know I don't feel so lonely [laughter]\nIf I wasn't alone I Would walk complete silence so that if there was an noise I Would hear up\n... yeah

possibility anyway as nine Seventeen yeah here's something that's interesting though you know the president said that about Stormy Daniels\nAnd I get the president can get away with it because we all know Donald Trump says things you know a little outlandish she had taken the high road there for a while\nAfter the Kavanaugh hearings but you know went back to his old\nCrazy self with this tweet yesterday but now I'm seeing where over in Alaska and I don't really follow politics in Alaska much I I keep forgetting it's one of our states\n[laughter] it's way on over there and you you just don't pay much attention to Alaska well apparently their lieutenant governor has gotten into trouble\nFor quote unspecified inappropriate comments and he's resigned\nAnd I guess there's a reelection fight for the governor there Governor Bill Walker and Alaska so in his resignation letter he said his decision was compelled by inappropriate comments I made the place the person who am I respect and revere in a position of vulnerability\nAnd apparently this person is a woman the nature of the comments that were unclear the Walker the governor describe them as an inappropriate overture\nTo a woman now\nSo what does that mean is it over in other words he was flirting with a woman a baby you look good or you look good in that ... is that an overture is that what that means or was it\nYou know [noise]\nCourse face I mean I Know\nReporters or you know asking all kinds of questions I don't think it was any kind of tweet or anything\nBut\nWalker's office the governor's office there says they're trying to be careful in what details it releases because the woman involved\nDidn't want to be publicly identified but if I'm I'm again I ... why is he said it in front of a bunch of people I guess that's why he's resigning or maybe he sent some text messages\nTo this woman or I mean who knows\nThe governor learned of the incident from his chief of staff Scott Kendall but for a debate earlier this week and then the governor later spoke at greater links\nWith his chief of staff and then with the lieutenant governor and then that's when the lieutenant governor offered his resignation interesting\nI guess he didn't want to be caught up in the whole me to if it was some sort of overture that was completely inappropriate but I Wonder I Wonder I mean it would have to be pretty bad if the lieutenant governor is resigning over it\n\nOther people are reacting including you know the governor's opponents in the governor's race there saying respect for women and the dignity of all Alaskans is our responsibility\n[noise]\nAnd he don't he I'm just making sure because I Want to ...

true not again it's my own business if I don't want to eat the ashes\nAnd my grandpa that in my business and it's not your business but when you start passing it out to other people that's that I don't know him as a special kind of sick did you guys ever watch\nThe HBO's series six feet under yes oh not that was it was great which I Wish I Would never would have been at the crazy crazy show just one of my favorite episodes I'll describe here in a minute 'cause it doesn't have anything to the topic but\nIn this particular show there was a bicycle gang if I were recall and they lost one of their head bikers or what have you\nAnd so they decided to cremate the body and they did have the funeral service at the funeral home in six feet under and then they took the ashes and separated it between all of them and they all sniffed it like cocaine put it to sniff up the ashes of their leader up their nose\nThat to me is just a special kind of sick\nYeah Richard to do that through did he really were to smoke it like his father or someplace smoked his father in fact there was like Norma build it in some smoking\nPapers and lit it ah suffer marginally wow the race but again that's his own business and he wants to smoke is a spot for at least dangerous telling you [laughter]\n... what was great and now I'm going to change is that so what was great about this show six feet under and you can um you can ... watch it if you want\nBecause it was pretty great I thought it was great it it was about a family that owns a funeral home but they lived in that ... so the upstairs is where they live the downstairs was the funeral parlor a the showcase of the\nOf the caskets that you could choose from you know and then at the chapel room where the body would lay and uh the basement was is where they would embalmed the bodies you know next so it was a very it was a family business you know they all live there and and they were very dysfunctional family\nUm but what I loved about it is that the start of every episode was a different way a person died\nYeah and so I mean just these crazy unique ways some were just basic somebody just died in an old man died and asleep I remember one and old man was opening up a can of peaches and he just died you know and then but then you have these crazy ones my favorite episode\nAnd panic hospitals will get how funny this is so it starts with a um a store like hustler or what are some of those others you know kind of adult themes stores mhm [noise] um I think there's one called love Shaq\nThere's you know these and I don't know anything about [laughter]\nThese adults seem stores and so they had the there there was a birthday party or something coming up so these two people came to pick up the blow up ... right and and they were blow up do balloons and so they had they were naked\nThey had the body parts on them you know a mouths open I'll just leave it at that and they had I guess helium and then they were for this part of his adult party and so these two guys were picking them up and they put them in the back of this truck and put a net over it\nSo that they wouldn't blow it I mean there was a ton of them for like the back of a pickup truck the neck over it so they wouldn't vote so they're driving down the highway\nAnd they hit this bump and when it hit the bumps the net came off ... and the balloons that looked like naked bodies started to float up into the air [noise]\nFlash back a couple of cars there is a woman driving along and she's singing her gospel music and she's praising Jesus thank you Jesus for this day I Love you lord and she's singing or gospel music\nAnd she looks up and she says he's he's a flaw in the air and she thinks it's the rapture\nYep she's stops or car in the middle of the road\nAnd starts run and thank you worked on Libya\nAnd a and a dump truck snacks and\nOver and it's over [laughter]\nSo then the family thinks that she committed suicide because she all the witnesses say she just ran out in front of this dump trucks she's got out of her card out in front of a dump truck so they think that I don't\nUnderstand and she wasn't depressed she was and that that was the story is the best to me the best episode of doubt about that one faith after you know\nThey say oh ...\n... with the [laughter] All right I'm Sorry I digress I'm your ... [laughter] yes that was actually\nThe story that brought all this a socialite this crazy gr she's there's something a little wrong with this young girl\nShe may just be a jokester a prankster maybe ... I mean these days it's sad though maybe back in the day you could pull some pranks and it would be funny hilarious et cetera et cetera these days you can't do any of that\nBecause somebody some parent will be offended\nOr upset or again there's zero tolerance at schools anymore seat you can't you can't goes you can't have a good striking at a football game anymore without getting ... and you know

allegedly by Saudi people and you know I ...\nAnyway we're going to talk about but my question is should America do anything about that the guy was not an American citizen so why are we even getting involved\nThat's part of my question and I'm just asking I'm not trying to be harsh um but I can I tell this story speaking of not knowing what you're eating true story I Will leave names out to protect the innocent\nBut you know I was involved in Christian music for a long time friend of mine and very popular songwriter written a lot of songs that if you know anything about Christian music
