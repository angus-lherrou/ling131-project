process was not smart I went to the technology scans resume storms find the right people\nInformation field opinion driven that\nFor talk Ninety nine seven double duty I'm a ... hour radio\nYeah we're a bunch of talk show host whether you get it or don't on the air and off the air we're a family\nAnd just like your family at home\nSome of us have different gifting some of us have different life experiences and expertise in this particular case when it comes to trusting members of this club of one hundred the guy who was at Fox\nNews or at WM AOL and close to these\nUh non always predictable and trustworthy senators is our very own Brian Wilson from Nashville's morning news uh Brian I don't think there's anything I can say\nOr give me an example there's going to make Dan Man just trust Senator Flake until he cast his vote uh but I Would say this it's a good day for Brett Kavanaugh he goes three for for with these key senators he gets flake and Collins and mentioned\nI'm On board to move this forward only Murkowski voting against so three for forward the fire we've all been isolating and he gets the votes to to bring this to a vote tomorrow or the question is will they hold and we won't know until tomorrow but your thoughts on what we just experienced live on the air last half hour\nWell I was watching it here uh and and look at it it was high drama I mean there's an old joke about senators and that uh they work a lifetime to earn those seats in the Senate chamber and then they never set in them\n[laughter] but\nEverybody every Republican I think was in their chair and is that it was very dramatic as each name was called they stood and announce their votes and as you characterized it correctly or Murkowski was uh no I was a little surprised by that uh Collins and ... and so it was mentioned so\nIf they vote on Saturday as they have voted to day then it becomes a associate justice Brett Kavanaugh he's confirmed\nIt's just this we've got twenty four hours more than twenty four hours now for this thing to percolate and we have seen that Jeff Flake is someone who can be persuaded and ah and I I I don't quite trust him yet either\nEither let me all the rides going to say let me add add to that just for going to dust that out I mean it's a it's a legitimate ankle\nHave waited for every critical moment to have some kind of a bomb to drop do they have a force accusers include surface tonight\nUm I don't think the rhetoric of you know we halted everything we demanded an FBI\nInvestigate they got it they got their summaries they got their facts they got their three oh to interview results um now they can act like they're not satisfied well you didn't talk to these people are that people are the friends from the beach\nUm you know the scope was too tight I I don't think that's helping anybody\nI mean well I I agree with you at this point what wrinkles could they throw because they are driven they'll go as low as they need to\nThere's an old saying you don't know what you don't know and we don't know what they might have in their in their back pocket there have been this has been an unpredictable process look\nHonestly I think you're right I think Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed tomorrow I think the votes we saw here will be the vote we see tomorrow\nBut Collins made a very interesting comment she says\nI'm not going to tell you how I'm going to voted to three o'clock this afternoon I voted to put it forward to bring the process to a final vote that's what cloture is the clock is ticking now thirty hours after run off the clock before the vote can be taken that would be something like four o'clock on Saturday\nSo I I expected probably everybody will vote as they did on cloture\nNow use Holland's might not you could afford to lose Collins because it was a way to make a man you can lose that I Can't you see again you can lose Collins and it's like well right fifty one right you got to have fifty\nYou gotta have fifty and then there'll be a fifty fifty tie\nAnd the vice president would come in and breaks the tie\nI'd have to think that as to think that there did we asked him if he was if you lose two votes he is not confirmed if you lose one vote he could still be confirmed\nAnd I I'm I'm gonna we've stayed you state of this morning and I stayed at this but I Want to reiterate it at this critical moment in the conversation\nThis is just the process the procedural vote of cloture to move it to a full Senate vote ... um and so you know it it has happened in certain issues\nWhere there are people that think oh this is the debate we have set everything we have looked at everything you know maybe we don't one hundred percent agree but we could argue about this till the cows come home until Jesus returns it's just we're done arguing it's time to vote\nThat doesn't mean that even though I think the debate is over and it's time to vote that because I voted yes at the debate is over and it's time to vote means I'm going to vote yes to confirmed this individual in this case ... we make that very clear\nI just think my point is I think ... have been very consistent and the case of flaking his flight out before he could flake out again any flight out last week uh but I think he got what he asked for and he seems happy\nWith what he got and saw I think that's the consistency of what he and Collins keeps saying yes this investigation has satisfied to me there's no corroboration in fact continued one hundred percent refute\nOf all of these claims and I am now ready to move forward and vote and then the vote to enclosure and debate confirms to me and I'm just using words\nAs they mean that it did in fact satisfy what they were curious about and I think the proclivity would be that they would now confirmed because they've had everything that they were questioning satisfied\nSo I think I'm just I'm guessing that I'm going to turn it over to you you're the experts we were talking about Islam I'd say Brian just sit down for a second let me finish\nBut I miss you take the lead but to me all indications look like they've got like ... and mansion unless there's a shenanigans\nI Believe you're right I Believe you're right but I just I Want to do is like an earlier this morning when I was putting a percentage on it I said I'm eighty five percent sure cabin always going to be confirmed\nAfter the vote um Ninety five percent sure so I Want to leave out that five percent option just because I'm a worry wart and and and this this process has been so unpredictable maybe in the next few minutes maybe we'll hear Collins coming out this afternoon at four or three or four o'clock in the afternoon two o'clock our time\nAnd say yes I'm going to vote confirmation she's going to make that announcement at a at three o'clock which will be two o'clock our time\nThis maybe we'll get a more definitive answer from flake about his intention on the vote tomorrow and it will become certain\nBut but at this moment I just want to leave open the option that people who vote for cloture do not have to necessarily vote to confirm to nominate two separatist in an unpredictable process\nAnd I want to leave open the five percent chance here it could still go on the toilet but I think you're right I think this bodes very well for Brett Kavanaugh I'm pretty sure he's going to be confer\nMansion or this has been a political football from the very beginning and I don't think and today it was a political football there were a lot of empty desks or and most of them were days are but mansion comes out and vote in support of ending cloture\nNow mansion you know we've had this whole conversation about flight could flake or Collins can surprise us this afternoon around to central time\nYou know where's the mansion and all that I think in a case manager not only does he have to move forward with this he almost has to be either the deciding vote or or make some kind of a strong stance at the\nAt what this party has demonstrated um I don't think it has to go so far to bash his party but I mean\nThis is a guy that is he is on the ropes I think that makes his vote pretty secure I think so I don't think you can survive voting against well\nI don't know I'm not sure I look at his numbers and he's got a lead but it ain't much I Will I'll bet you this though Michael right now and the state of West Virginia they are running some snap phone calls and find out how this goes over oh you know and I got twenty four hours to get an answer\nSo don't be surprised I mean I I ... I mean you can lose mansion and as long as you had the others who you're ...\nThe vice president breaks the tie\nHe's confirmed I just think that mentioned as a guy who I think you're probably right I think he probably votes to confirm it's in his interest I think to do that but if they if they run a poll today and they find out that this went very badly for him\nThen it would it would it might change his vote I think\nBeing a very red state\nI think Trump is very popular in the state of West Virginia I think you're you're an assessment is right but they find some kind of polling data that suggests that that that is not the right take he could be lost but it's not it's not the end of the world if we lose mansion the thing about mentioned that I like is that means that it's a bipartisan\nVote at least ... de la credit guarding\nGo to the heart I was just gonna ask you that how important I think it is for Brett Kavanaugh or even the president who brought him forward that this not come down to a vice presidential tie break and then it doesn't come down to one another\nThan party line in terms of conversation and talking points heading into emitter\nI'd I don't think it matters all much uh if if it goes with fifty votes and the vice president comes in and breaks the tie\nHe still confirmed I it would be nice to be able to say that you know I think I think I'm correct in saying that if it was a straight party line vote on Kavanaugh it would be the first time a Supreme Court\nJustice has been confirmed on a party line vote\nOr and so I think it's nice to be able to say well we had at least one Democrat but we're in New territory I mean you know a Kagan and and uh and some of the other Democrat or you know the nominees put forward by Democrats they often got eighty or Ninety boats that's never going to happen to\nWas conclusive it's put everybody's political tactics to rest\nIt has certainly set the table to vote how the vote goes tomorrow I think it becomes a Supreme Court justice but time will tell and as low as the Democrats have been playing between\nNow and tomorrow afternoon or two I literally\nEx back and everything\nIn production few times I mean these these bills news and\nWPN new center I'm Pamela for with your time stories the Senate has pushed Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court pass they keep procedural vote\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nMy new rounds you tells us that depending on the numbers a final vote may not be concluded until Sunday\nComplicating factor being Steve Dane's at Montana Republican senator who supports red cabinet is go is attending his daughter's wedding back in Montana tomorrow walking down the aisle with our eye and he plans to come back\nIf his vote is needed so that means they may hold open the votes overnight until you were ... early morning Sunday\nNow all eyes were on four senators his votes were not known West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin he voted yes to move forward he was wavering back and forth Lisa Murkowski of Alaska she voted no\nAnd Jeff Flake of Arizona yes then we had of course Susan Collins she was a yes vote to move forward but says\nShe's not making public how she will vote on Kavanaugh's actual confirmation I\nWill announce my intention son how to vote later today said he ...\nHe has reaction from the White House the\nPresident has no public events when his schedule but following the ... vote to move the nomination forward he tweets very proud of the U.S Senate for ... to advance the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh\nTennessee US Senators Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander were also yet that yes votes and right before the vote to move forward former governor Phil Bredesen who is running for Corker seat\nAnd after weeks of dodging the question of how he'd vote said he'd vote yes for judge Kavanaugh to sit on the Supreme Court of course Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who is also running for the Corker said has been a yes all along that is the latest news it is ... by farmers insurance weather is next time Pamela ... and everything\nWe can Capital Management whether ... years or more warm weather forecasting\nSizzling hot once again today near record breaking heat temperatures in the lower ... boss the sunshine also very muggy out their tonight partly cloudy and warm with a low seventies to just an isolated shower possible this weekend daytime high still in the lower nineties\nBy early next week back to the upper eighties when the vote on whether center a meteorologist adapting to Lauren machine you\n... for P.

[laughter] I had been looking forward to Lady Gaga oh and a star at orange for seven months and they get to go this weekend you are going it is one of the more strange things\nYou know where that email or you know going out on a ... why would so counter to what you believe I don't think Lady Gaga and I have anything in common by frankly\nI've just always found her um how I get a very extraordinary talent that has gone I notice now you know wearing meat dresses and bizarre wigs it was all brilliant for marketing purposes but what made it even more brilliant was\nOnce she got became a household name with all that nonsense and she took it all off\nAnd then she just sat at a piano\nAnd knocks you write off your feet I loved that yet a hidden surprised yeah and so in all of my study of Lady Gaga the one thing that it's just kind of been floating around for a long time is and I and I always use this technology it's if you watched the Robin Williams documentary you know our most of us would say while\nFunniest guy whoever lived and man who knew he could act [laughter] well the reality was Robin Williams was a Juilliard trained actor yeah\nAt Juilliard a the one was with a house in um residual yard\nThat's music no it's the house ... school of acting\nI mean he and Christopher Reeve graduated together and he was a trained actor who had never done communism life and stumbled on it All right that's why when you saw Robin Williams and um I could pick any a a one hour photo\nMay have been one of his best performance as he was ... oh my gosh so he was bizarre way is great\nBut I mean when we think of what's the one ah how do you like them apples uh\n[noise] oh the one with Ben Affleck and Matt do a good Will Hunting Will Hunting and that's why he was so good and that's what he was he's also the fact that he was the land yeah which is a New Orleans expression for bonus\nWell Lady Gaga is a trained actress who's passion and life is acting\nNow look at my passion and life is not radio so I can look in the eye and say you know for something that's not my passion and I'm not that bad I'll never be considered for the tendency radio hall of fame Pamela
