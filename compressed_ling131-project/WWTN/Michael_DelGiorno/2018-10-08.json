I don't know that sounds like the craziest thing in the world\nShe's awesome now I mean you you just can't help but lover\nWell I put on Facebook I said it's not only blows away all the other versions I mean it's not it's not just going to be your favorite a star is born version yeah it might literally be the best movie you've ever seen in your life Bradley Cooper shoots a beautiful picture he really does he um he tells an amazing story you know it's we watch Clint Eastwood and\nHe's got this new one coming out where he's a mule Clint Eastwood is yeah interest eighty seven years old man he's still newly drawn [laughter] God off color and still kicking people [laughter] you know he's not retired he's still pushing some folks in Maryland but I always thought you know I'm\nI favorite ... light a fire probably for me I Know that probably\nFor me it's the it's Gran Torino immigrants Reno was great oh my own into westerns you know oh like yeah those are head make my\nDay I I just I loved him in line of fire but I'm telling you there's nothing like the way Clint Eastwood directs you tell us a beautiful story you know you're watching a Clint Eastwood movie when you're watching it

some things on YouTube with those with ... with you know with with Clinton fading into the sunset uh let me tell you something\nBradley Cooper is going to be one of the great great directors of our products or many days in the future I thought this picture was flawlessly shot a story was flawlessly told it was falsely active I Will say this this is my only get rex read on everybody my bet nobody even knows directs the rate is\nOr some sort of movie critic Iraq's is probably going everybody's gay now [laughter] crap he's probably dead though right I don't I have no I Googled rex read dead or alive\nAll writers one of the original gay movie critics who now by the way we masculine rex read a review rex read couldn't he's to mask going to get a gig on CSI one hundred in New York is out\nEverybody cents thing now and I think it's feminine male feminine male\nRich read rex Taylor read as an American film critic who is or even years old eighty years old yeah\nWow he must have had safe sex [laughter] All right so it's\nLike rex read but um it really was beautifully told beautifully shot um you know it is not easy to make a remake\nAnd you've got to you've got other expectations and other performances there's only so many ways to tell the same story and they managed to do it it's nothing like any of the others it is absolutely spectacular the my only criticism would be\nHe was a more talent to sounds terrible especially the same Nashville 'cause I Know but I watch people love Chris christopherson uh-huh but I sense he was doing a better version of Chris christopherson he certainly\nDid a lot of Chris christopherson type stuff I think that's why he'll win the Oscar for best director but not for best actor but don't get me wrong Bradley Cooper was flawless\nA Lady Gaga wins the Oscar hands down there is nobody than er league there is no contest well will be interesting to see is if they got enough screen time\nIn order to win enough votes to win best supporting actor because Andrew dice clay as Lady Gaga is father is that is ...\nAnd I know a lot of people love Sam Eliot plays a Bradley Cooper his brother and you simply don't have that movie without two things those supporters to go along with it and especially say I'm Elliot I think and do a great degree the ensemble\nI'm dice clay um which reminded me of how they use Carroll O'Connor in return to me the Minnie Driver David accompany movie but it's a group of Italian wise say Italian they worry he was Italian apparently but\nYou know there's ones he owns a limousine service they got a black guy an older guy and and their whole area is that is a funny they are the comic relief throughout the vehicle um\nAnd my guess is they don't get the polling numbers either and there are a lot more related

one in less than a week [noise] rustic\n[noise]\n\n\n... even ...\nIs a\n\nMan\nWith my\nManager said\nOr the other is I guess at some point was Saturday Night live we went from laughing with them to ask them a they have gotten so political like so many of the late night talk shows and so unfair quite frankly I'm I don't mind the bias if you're funny I'll give you a great example I thought it was very biased\nOr to pick Brett Kavanaugh in an opening segment two weeks ago and not Christine Ford\nUm but it was funny a it was certainly very biased in its portrayal of Brett Kavanaugh but it was funny and then there's just biased hateful and ugly that's not even an attempt to be funny and that's always the weekend update\nShow and afterwards he gave an unplanned speech to the audience and we started over as well just the beginning of it\nLast week tiny west performed on the show and afterwards he gave an unplanned speech to the audience and supported Donald Trump hearing his reaction by the way I think it's\nVery unfair I mean I understand that we live in a viral world and everybody not everybody but it's certainly not a reviewer Saturday Night live but many got to see what Kanye West set but Kanye West it Kanye West had the class to wait till after the show was over to say what he said to an audience that presumably was there also to see him\nSaturday Night live takes to the heart of the show to attack him for his stance and here's how they did it\nIn a ... speech is Pete David [noise]\n\nTourists are a lot of people thought Shay should be the wanting to talk about ... we discuss the you know ... black but like I'm Crazy and we both know\nWhich side of ... at the wheel right now [noise]\nSo speaking strictly for myself or what kind of said after he went off the air last week was one of the worst like most awkward things I've ever\nSeen here I've seen Chevy Chase speak to an intern [noise]\nWe all had to stand behind them and here's what it looked like so I mean I'm like on the Web or\nMy God [noise] but I'm like I Want a career as a way\nOf [noise]\nOf China was wearing a mad guy had a [laughter] call them stupid [laughter]\nAny started by saying people backstage tried to bully wearing it he wore it all week uh like nobody told them not to wear a wire I Wish I could you I Wish I Would have suggested that you know it might upset some people like your wife for every black person ever\nI Wish someone bullied me into not wearing mishap\nIt was someone that was the second stupidest thing I was wearing [noise]\nThing kind of said that Democrats broke up black families with welfare and that's slavery is not real [noise] um you know how wrong about politics you have to be for like me to notice\nWhat China is a genius but like a musical genius\nYou know white Joey Chestnut as a hotdog eating genius\nI don't want to hear Joey Chestnut opinions about things that aren't hotdog related\nBut I I play this clip because I wanted to hear that right there I mean I think that's the essence of it and you're a comedian\nA skipped player not a genius\nAnd and the two that hosts that particular segment or comedians and not political experts and Taylor Swift as a singer not a political endorse or an expert it's funny how it's never a two way street the worst part of this I don't want to be extra extra late but they crank it back up the they literally comprehend [laughter]\nNothing wrong with them if I [noise]\nLike I Know your life you know this is the real me I'm off the men [noise]\nSame in the in the medicine game [laughter]\nThere's nothing wrong with them if I ever got on a plane and the pilots said I just want you to know\nMe [noise]\nThey're in our lives weekly portrayal and it is if you don't agree with them and if you don't agree with their world view a leftist a far leftists world do you belong on medicines you're crazy you're nuts I thought it was disrespectful would county did was off the or what they did was on the air\nUm I don't know how they get away with this stuff but at some point we're not laughing with you anymore we're laughing at you because election after election year that out of touch with the American people you're that much in your own a lead us bubble\nSurrounded by your other high school dropouts don't get these issues and I suspect Saturday Night live like CNN MSNBC like Taylor Swift like the rest of the\nThey're in for a very shocking November\nBut you know I don't discuss chemistry I stay out areas I'm not an expert at but they never do and then they criticize others when they do as they're doing it I mean the ... of the left it has never been more\nAmateur display than it has been of late Saturday Night live get ugly at some point we're not laughing with you were laughing at you a star is born in a star is dumb and I'll let you figure out which ones are done which one is Taylor Swift we'll\nGet to rule of law the real winner of this whole cap in our case when we come

I care about how your toothbrush looks feels and the quality of every bristle\nQuip has a lightweight and sleek design with simple pine vibrations and guiding pulses for public two minute clean\nAnd

brushing better with quip\nAre so we'll keep an eye on that series title one game apiece as well and the NFL the titans you just can't get down inside the Fifteen yard line and not get touchdowns and

Football or the cowboys drop Nineteen sixteen to the Houston and the battle of Texas\nOr they lose to the Texans Monday Night football tonight is the saints and the Redskins college vows played the best 'cause they didn't play that he lost for one Thirteen to Georgia\nAh Austin P. a winter forty nine thirty four over tea su the tigers and empty su one thirty four twenty four over we're on Mars show Texas knocked off OU Florida knocked off LSU that's the shake up in the top Tim but for Alabama Georgia Columbus in Ohio State known to test this weekend\n[noise] um [noise] interesting you know and and again I\nThink a lot of you guys get this um but I thought this was beautifully written for Fox News it was an opinion done by John fun and he he was covering the winners and losers of this whole confirmation of Kavanaugh fight and I I think everybody was sense and sensibilities say well why would Dianne Feinstein hold that\nI mean why would she have cabin on or off us and not say anything why would she let everything get right to where the confirmation vote was about to happen and then drop the whole Christine forward bomb even against Christine for its wishes and waste a month and a half that could have been used to investigate so as far as I'm concerned the Democrats and I think a lot of people agree with me were clearly\nPulling the stunt a desperation\nStopped I mean they said from the very beginning we're going to find a way to block this and that's what they got down to add to go that low in limbo a politics game\nUh and they really don't have any right to be critical of the FBI and seventh investigation on this particular individual uh when they could have investigated his throes they wanted to if they hadn't held it on purpose\nAll right so this was the left doing now for their three characters that they brought forward again you know there are women who get assaulted there are women who get raped\nAnd it's serious business that's why false allegations can be serious business too\nI have no problem with Brett Kavanaugh getting this confirmation because Christians forward story had constant inconsistencies in constant holes in the story I don't care how common that is with people who've been assaulted you just don't not say anything to anybody for thirty six years\nAnd then when you do say it's so in consistently oh I I have to have multiple doors that I have claustrophobia I can fly and then we prove you're flying everywhere\n\nYour friends as you were extremely happy and you're five hundred square foot efficiency but the only one door I mean things just don't add up\nWhen you did finally bring it up Thirty years later you never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh and it was nowhere near therapists notes not that anybody was willing to share those notes and every single person you said that was there not only could not corroborate the all refuted your story that's a problem sweat Nick is beyond even me ... litigating wasting my breath\nSo in this particular case there were no cases and all that really lingers is\nIs the troubled thought that we could have weaponized allegations that rule of law and due process no longer matter and our country that anybody can say anything and destroy someone like the writer for Stephen Colbert tweeted well they get Kavanaugh but at least we destroyed them\nWhich tipped way down to late everybody saw it so now she's apologized and said oh I was just trying to be funny really because that's really what a lot of people it finally summer surmise from this entire situation\n\nThat is all you were trying to do desperately a race that twenty sixteen election for what you believe again delusion only will be a twenty Eighteenth election\n\nAnd it's hard not to ... you know almost find it entertaining to watch them watch their heads explode I mean I don't know if you saw the women screaming and clawing with their fingernails at the door of the Supreme Court building but I don't know what danger they think Brett Kavanaugh\n\nCreates for them it scares the hell out of me to think there are people like that out there living\nSo who were the real big winners in the big losers in that you're going to see a lot of people try to make political sense of this\n\nAnd none of it even when they're trying to spin it makes any sense oh this is going to energize suburban women this is going to help Democrats then you'll have others say we don't think this is energizing anybody\nIn fact as we look at the CBS polling information I'm Brett ascending Blackburn we don't see this energizing cabinet having anything to do with it but then they'll go right in the next breath that in the next sentence and safe but it does seem to have energized a lot of people that will benefit Republicans\nWill not a bizarre answer\nMidterms are low turnout elections enthusiasm is what you need to follow the lesson to liberals are good at getting paid for and going to a demonstration and earning the money they've been paid\nThey are good at getting behind an individual candidate like a Hillary like a Bernie like Iraq but they can never talk honestly about the issues issues tend other than\nHistoric proclivities tend to drive mid term elections and so when I look at this I'd see the enthusiasm growing on one side and non existent on another\nIf not diminishing on the other not
