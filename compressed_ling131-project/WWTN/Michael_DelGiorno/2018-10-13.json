Goodman system or sixteen ... system or sixteen so your train system or whatever\nYou get to condense or in the cold but you don't get the furnace and you don't have sixteen SERE\nAll those systems are matched um the a C condense or the AC cold the AC furnace or the the the heating furnace all those things are matched together provide\nUh the uh the level of efficiency\nOr that you're being sold so uh you know some guys will or will sell them the sixteenth ... condense or in cold but the customer doesn't want to buy the farm is but they don't make the customer aware of\nYou really kind of wasting your money because you're gonna keep that old furnace and um it's going to use twice as much energy is that new one would and you don't have sixteens here you have less than that so\nI'm just uh just through your research and and do your homework and\nUm make sure you know you're trying to have that keep that maintenance done year by year in the wintertime obviously we're a as we get their summer we're going to be getting into fall in the wintertime you're going to want to have that fall maintenance done\nUm those are those gas furnaces those heat pumps\nI'm you know that that ... issue something that ah that attack will find if he comes out\nIn the fall and he's checking your heat pump out he was going to clean it up he's going to check it\nUm he's going to put his gauges own it he's gonna he's gonna fire that thing up and watch the pressures run and then he's going to initiate today frost and check it and make sure it comes in and goes out and the shift in properly that is doing exactly what it's supposed to do that the outdoor fans cutting off like it's supposed to\nKnow that that's something else that you can see some of the sometimes the thing is going to a day for almost ... somethings walk around with the er the ... supposed to break that connection and the outdoor fan so the fame continues to run\nAnd you have a longer day for all cycle 'em and you have more ... cycles because it doesn't accomplish what it's supposed to win that in that instance so just make sure you're doing that maintenance my sure you're keeping everything clean make sure everything's being done the way it's supposed to and it's running like it's supposed to\nUm the number here it's again it's a station and we're going to go back to the phones of six one five\nSeven three seven Ninety nine eighty six six one five seven three seven Ninety nine eighty six is the efficient heating and cooling our your host Jeff Eddie with the fish and heating and cooling give us a call will try to help you out\nLet's go to Sally and tell the homeless LA are you there\nYeah hello how are you\nAnd and now that you I'm doing fine what can do for you\nUm I like the rain that scares me ... and I'm not very often get killed in a way yes my and it looked\nI noticed something black around the same thing that scares me it looks like there's the mold and are around are coming out of ... stares catering than fly in the world make common man\nDay will come after they say yeah yeah but not to eat you know eight ... uh no I've heard you talk about the other end it's like the ... the a ha\nA good year I had one of them and some aren't supplements\nYou can do the reason I asked if um if you had a package unit are split his because oh you're in burger stuff is in\nThe a split systems and so like your inverted heat pumps which have a lot better than a normal heat pump a split systems so you could if you wanted to just supplement one room you want to just do something like that you could definitely Adam ... or something like that and do it\nOr or you could just if you have the room and to to change the way that Duckworth set up and put the air handler into the house you could go to in burger\nUm hate ... it just you know it's it's going to be more money and more work than would normally be because you're going damn packaged was split but it's doable\nYes all riding a bike sir thanks where you All right let's go to Mike in Clarksville Mike are you there is or how you doing fine how are you\nAll right um my situation is we have a home is about thirty two hundred square foot had central heat in there\nBut we haven't used it in probably seven eight years 'cause it ...\n... and a\nTime I got him out of the\n... the poor cleaned it but when I'm Out in the country so one of the farmers all cut the corn and hey mice corner everybody's house right keep getting into the work making NAFTA or whatever so\n... years ago I just decided well I'm not going to have that airborne from my house with my family might start making their sense\nOf turn it off haven't used it all the\nTime than you than you or eight feet on the house you don't come out they banned\nUh yeah you can roll around and do stuff with them\nSometimes they don't work to do it and I just recently found out about a mini splits right I had never even heard yeah I've been there are a lot of reading looking at Youtube videos and kind of an I'm trying to determine what's the best model\nA narrative down to miss a beat the pioneer and fuzzy too I Won a trip hanging on ... street and then I have another question\nMitsubishi is is a lot years have everybody else\nOkay best on the market [noise] a federal that go without question\nI'm thinking about doing most of the work myself because I'm pretty good with fixing trying to figure out stuff really good\nAnd I wanted to put it in and really comes when I read that it comes with copper coil it got to make sure you do not income 'cause you gotta you know drill a hole come\nDown put uh it does something on the outside the covered up make it look like it's a you drank pop or something right [laughter] but\nPenn something other than copper line as long as it is is there any flexible whole no regrets and go you\nKnow it well there is but the pressures are going to be so much higher on are hurting the pressures are going to be so ... that that you want to stay with cover\nWith the copper because of the pressure\nYup stay with copper because of the pressure they're trying to develop some new products that maybe eventually be able to do some of that but none of that stuff's really tested in tried at this point in any kind of pigs or anything like that's not going to hold up so he won't use copper and I'm at this kind of what you can be stuck with the time being\nOkay and the war and the United states or a multi unit where you can do for five room with one I'm outside unit uh-huh do do they come with all the connections ... unit already\nYes when the when you order it depending on the system you get like if it's a ... she'll have a what's called a branch bombs so the ... runs from the can dance or to a branch bombs and all the heads are fed off of that branch box\nAnd you you know when you order you just make sure you get all the pieces for it I'm so whenever you get it you're just going to have to talk to whoever selling it and make sure they give you everything you need\n... what is already to forty outside bother your head while I was planning on\nStarting up and they'll they'll be there should be enough power out there\nThat burns park has it made it onto the market a separate item that I got to unfold world\nIt's a separate out um\nArcher appreciate your health\nArt Thanks Mike or let's go to Mary in Murfreesboro what's going on where\nI think that all that far from here and are there any health care [noise]\nUm yes their health hazard hazards from fumes\nI Can't imagine trying to a spray foam the actual duct work in the cross place\nUm spray foam if if you're talking about the commercial grade where they come in with a machine and um and that chemical is mixed it a hundred and forty degrees I just don't see it being a good idea to to try to start sprained your duct work with that stuff I'm\nNot sure it's going to stick really well and then I'm not sure what's going to happen when it does and this stuff continues to cure sometimes for a while so\nI'm really needs to be open and breathe good whenever it's sprayed and you don't need to be there and so just the whole concept an idea of trying to spring my duct work which moves all there in my house and I'm breathing it with something that as a general rule you don't need to be around and breathe and until it's completely cure it out I don't like that idea\nOkay that having them around there\nYeah they just need you just need to insulate showed up and they can and they can take and clean they they can fill that duct up and then insulated and it'll be fine okay\nAll right thank you All right let's go to Milton in Nashville got one minute Milton what's going on\nOkay if you got it split in it a good thing getting unit that we've had some issues with we had a dream tray the get plugged up and had to get back cleaned up but it century and at that time and now the or it doesn't seem like a thin it blowing hard enough\nUh I've gone up into the dropped feeling and opened up the infection panels while I was in while I was up there you know check coils make sure that they weren't clogged up and they were bombing while while I had it open\nMy uh uh uh the coils started the frost that bombing and so I'm I've got you know I've got cold up there but my fans just that blowing strong enough\nTo ... All right um [noise]\nThere can be so many different reasons why that thing was ... I'm not really sure how the system was set up as far as the access panel it might have been frost enough because you had the wrong pedal off in the air wouldn't actually pulling across the coal and then it could possibly be possible that's a little loan refrigerator and so an ISIS up and then cuts down the Airflow\nSo you're just going to have to have it looked at and have some I check it out and see what's going on gossip is\nThere any is there anything as far as turn into turning the feet up on the fan\nNow because it would have turned itself down on its own as well so you you're just going to have somebody look at a\nCar okay All right thanks ...\n... it's been the efficient heating and cooling our um your host Jeff Eddie with efficient heating and cooling we'll see you next week [noise]\n\n\nYeah they will result stay there and see what's at pretty down [noise]\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see it without my glasses I Can't really\nThat's what I'm hearing my glasses and contact her pain I'd love to finally get rid of these but\nWho can afford lasik you can\nBecause some basic vision if she was offering dramatically low prices and an absolutely free consultation jak tax clear nine nine to three five zero three five zero the lasik vision Institute has already perform over a million procedures they use the latest FDA approved lasik technology\nAnd helps the majority of patients itchy twenty twenty vision for a fraction of what others charge\nLet her vision better value the ...

Senate side on the house side I think I'm I'm Still the same um it's probably you know two thirds of it you know sixty six percent chance if the Democrats take\nThe house or you've got sixty nine districts Republican districts I've chopped up districts meaning Republican districts I think in play and probably only a handful of democratic districts\nReally in play a and I'm Talking about less than five show if these models that we've talked about over in prior years\nAre true and if and and stand up and hold off I should say and if there's you know if the Democrats prime if the Democrats turnout in this general as they have in the Democratic primaries this year\nI'm In the ... especially in Nineteen sixty nine then I'd definitely she's a Democrat from making a big move here and it's

financial\nEngines is incredibly proud to be named to barons list of top independent investment advisors or you know this is our first time on the list we debuted at number twelve that was out of forty firms that that barons ranked this year\nI interestingly enough parents expanded the list from thirty to forty spots this year and a lot of that was due to this just kind of incredible growth that we're seeing in the industry\nThere is another piece to the barons article that that has even more positive and optimistic news and that's because as parents put a private equity firm Helmand and Friedman bought financial engines for three billion dollars and moved to combine it with Edelman financial services\nAnd so that that's great news about where did Edelman financial services show up and the barons list top spot number one Edelman financial number one ranked from on the barons less so the two firms combined financial engines and Edelman financial lab that's pretty much the top dog in the industry now\nSo as you might imagine the deal generated a ton of bugs in the industry a financial planning called this a major deal in the industry or Michael kits has said that it's a

away from this week's portfolio review first we have a question from falling from Massachusetts hello any\nKind of fell on my question is forty eight yeah so um my husband\nAnd I make a right to their Seventeen thousand dollars a year I only have about eight thousand tonight thousand dollar and they've got a A R a I Would like to know how much I Need to put away fake\nIt we may need when I looked at it like question\nOkay great question um so you know kind of the easy answer is I usually tell people save as much as you can for as long as you can\nAnd so we kind of on top of that then you said All right so if you're forty eight you want to work until you're Seventy you've got about twenty two years and so that's a good amount of time\nTo get a fair amount of money or you know socked away or inside the Roth IRA again here's what she can keep in mind so with your Ross IRA\nUm and then you know the same could go for your husband as well so with your author raise each of you can contribute up to fifty five hundred dollars a year\nBefore your age fifty but maybe before you turn fifty so you're forty eight how old is your husband\nMatt ...\nOkay so each of you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars a year now once you turn fifty you can actually save you can save an additional thousand so you can say sixty five hundred dollars a year went on the ...\nWe know when you're fifty so here in a couple of years you can start saving sixty five hundred so what I Would do is just kind of have it in your mind you know for these next however many years however long you're working you plan on saving fifty five hundred dollars a year before age fifty\nAnd then sixty five hundred dollars a year for that twenty year period of time between age fifty in Seventy now when you when you retire so you want to work until you're Seventy the other thing I wanted\nTo really tired and that but at this point what choice because I thought\nOkay you know and I would say that you know I'm you've you've got the savings you're going to be working one of the things that we found that that is most helpful for people's um you know to to help them find success with their retirement is just working longer\nSo the fact that you want to work until I Seventy yeah might not be the thing that you thought was going to be the best thing in the whole world but it really is going to help you because the longer you work\nThe the less you have to pull from your investments uh you don't have to claim Social Security uh you know for a you know for anything for that so when you retire at Seventy you're going to have Social Security and then you're going to have your investments to live off of\nUm do you have any debt right now\nNo I pay off what might that\nPerfect All right so no debt um any other short term cash need that you see here in the next twelve to twenty four months\nNo okay I I I don't want to buy a house I'm going to face Fifteen talking and it I can try now okay so I feel like I used to own a house before I feel like my mortgage would find it out on a fucking run it out as a mortgage payment okay\nI'm I'm putting money away for a um a something for\nOur perfect perfect and if you're paying you know fourteen Fifteen hundred dollars a month in rent now the mortgage earlier was less than that you you can that's just budgeting um when that when that comes into play 'em so really what I Would have you do right now is you know for twenty two years\nOr however long it is you know that you're going to be a working you know plan on saving that fifty five hundred bucks we're sixty five hundred bucks into that Ross IRA now or do you have access to email\nI go okay um when you are in a position to\nSend me some more information about the Roth I can put some more ideas into an email for you just send me an email to ask Andy\nAt investing cents dot com but the the things that take away from the call right now you're going to save fifty five hundred and fifty five hundred will get your squared away with some different investing ideas for those Roth accounts\nAnd then pass that every three months or six months or so give me a call dropped me an email will kind of get your squared away for the next couple of of quarters\nAnd really will just kind of approach it from there once you get to you know maybe fifty five age sixty then we can start looking at um what you might need to be doing with Social Security what's your retirement income plan will be um you know how health care will be paid for all that stuff but\nI'd say right now

Henry writes\nI all of my retirement money at the bank in an IRA CD I'm sixty eight and a half and still working and I don't have any plans to retire I've been collecting Social Security for a few years and I just put the money in savings even if I wasn't working I could be about the same financially\nWhat if any other suggestions would you have for me\nWell I'm first of all I'm really glad that you reached out here a Henry we talk a lot about risk on investing sense and a lot of times it's from the perspective of a the potential of losing money\nBut you might actually be exposing your heart and savings to some overlooked risks are namely longevity and inflation K but set set those aside here for for a moment I think what this comes down to is that you might not be taking enough risk with these with the savings will\nHenry wrote that he's sixty eight and still working and then said I don't have any plans to retire that's a lot different than other sixty eight year olds and it sounds like that those are a couple of signs that he may be in good health and and could live for a good while longer\nTalk about how you are looking at the ... at the midterms right now in what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\nUm typically in the terms and you can go back many many many many years and look at the historical record others it's quite clear it seems that with the economy is strong or weak whether the president was popular or unpopular what tends to happen is whatever party\nDoes not control the White House makes big gains in the house and Senate okay and that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American salt and or maybe it's part of the human soul except the American system so little unique but the\nSo we see it here but for most people politics is like the Olympics were were you get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics once every four years [laughter] so the ah\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around that immigrants four years ago it was the Republicans\nWon one more question before we leave you know one of the interest most interesting things that you wrote about the China us negotiation is something that I mean is is completely unique I haven't seen it anywhere else but it makes total sense\nYou said one of the biggest concerns is what happens from a social construct with China\nIf they continue to push or if they pushing the wrong ways as you as negotiations continue\nUm you know especially as it relates to any sort of pressure that China would bring to bear on foreign businesses doing\nBusiness in China ... remind listeners what you were talking about because this is so important and when I share it with people you see the light bulb go on and it's just like of course ... I mean they do not want to risk is what is the social risk\nThat China faces that the U.S does not as we continue to move through these trade negotiations\nThe problem is it's a couple of different dimensions all were hit the other against China one is that the modern China or the China and out of subsistence farmers in rural poverty but of glittering cities are full of\nWorking class people it's never experienced a recession so it's ... we do not know how the Chinese population will react under anything but full employment of the highest unemployment rate the chimes experience the last twenty five years for quake three percent in this country we consider Fort Worth represent a boom\nYou know they they call that things are going so well so what would happen if they got six percent of seven percent you know now you would have and this is across the very very large population so he's percentage point represents many more millions of people that it does here [noise] uh\nIf China is a police state where a you've got to you know disarmed sheep like public being monitored at every street corner by cameras aren't official thicken recognition software [noise] so the problem with all police states is a problem of leverage is often actual originally with a\nRather its its political leverage by which I mean in any prison in any police environment you've got hundreds and hundreds of people\nThat wanna guard yeah that one guard has one God and that one good has twelve garbage is and one of the chamber and that's it and so if something goes terribly terribly wrong uh\nYou got what happened to the Soviet Union to any of that\nWhere a couple of people swarmed right with the Berlin Wall the for some reason the atmosphere research that\nThey made the decision about the machine guns and by the next twenty five people ran across the wall and then six weeks later the evil empire of the Soviet Union broken up at the vaccine separate countries right six weeks later and nobody\nNot all the great the good the wives of Henry Kissinger is of the world's predicted\nAnd things like that and it just happened to six weeks\nAnd so what can happen in a nation of one point four billion people where you've got you know half of them on minimum wage living in cities have stolen subsistence farms are there enough right believes\nThat is president Xi Jinping's nightmare that's where the pressure\nThat was our last gun he's the chief investment officer at trend macro ethics great friend of mine great bend of investing sense but do listen to the much longer conversation they're investing sense dot com\nAnd while you're at investing sense dot com you'll also find any conversation with J.
