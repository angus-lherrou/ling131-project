any type of\nA a sporting event you have to have a plan to know that you're going to win and if anything you want to win in his retirement\nUh I actually came across this subject as we build out this uh topic for today\nA in a Forbes article that had come out entitled seven steps to retirement reading this so obviously it caught my eye and these are the kinds of things that we've been preaching in teaching to our people and we continue to will do it again next year the year after five years from now ten years from now\nThese things don't get old they are so so important nothing happens without a plan every family needs to have a plan and it needs to be well thought out it doesn't need to be a hope so and that may be and I think so and and they don't need to be winging it they need to have a written playing like John if you're going on a vacation\nAnd you map out and plan out a trip\nExactly where you're going to stay if you're you said you're going to Dali would I mean there's preparation beforehand about where are we going to stay and is this place going to have enough room for the kids to run crazy and wild\nAnd or maybe not get hurt too badly and things are going to be any room where you can kind of pull off and be silent for a moment or walk in the woods\nYou have to have a plan of how you're going to get somewhere what you're going to do where are you going to say all these kinds of things that just a vacation that could last a few days to a week or two\nWe'll say a couple things that you know number one my wife is a teacher so she has a plan for everything number two um I had planned on walking in the woods wouldn't go together for a couple of days that I heard about some people that ran into a couple of bears just the other day so I'm not the fastest growing world I figure that won't that's not going to work out to us we're probably going to stay out of the woods but we do have a plan\nAnd you're right and the second step is in retirement is developing a pre determined income strategy you know I was seeing him on a couple just this last week and um we had met several times in we'd began to implement the plan and in the meantime the wife had retired five or six years ago and the husband is just recently retired\nAnd and I could I could feel that there was this tension in the room and and I finally just looked at him and I said okay a Bob in pain that's not their names its will come what what are you sensing what are you feeling he said\nHe looked at me and he said I just realized we're not getting a paycheck anymore and he says the first time I haven't gotten a paycheck and thirty eight years and he said John I'm scared to death\nAnd I said well the ... the good news is you've been responsible and you saved and I said we've we've got an incomplete and and I was able to go through and show them exactly where they were to get their income from if they lived ten years Twenty years Thirty years and then of course that brought a lot of peace of mind but Pete how many people do you know\nThey're retired that don't have an income plant just about everybody I mean when they come in they don't have one that's right and and they just essentially transfer their money into some funds with no formalized plan in terms of how they're going to get income so you want to have a plan you want to have a pre determinant complained the third step is\nCreating a strategy for minimal taxes and retirement\nCan you answer these two questions do you know exactly when you can retire or do you know how much you can afford to

retirement fund the right track six one five\nThree nine five three zero zero zero\nLooking back on John max in here with the vents and you're listening\nTo beacon retirement strategies radio show and we've been talking about today seven steps to retirement readiness this comes out of a Forbes article that Pete and I had read\nNot long ago and these are seven critical steps and so we're unpacking these things because the truth is a lot of people out there in fact you were talking about earlier that a third of people in America don't think they'll ever be able to retire and that's a travesty that really is if you want to keep working\nBecause you enjoy what you do that's one thing but to not think that you can retire literally a third of our population that's the tragedy so\nHow can you make sure you're in the two thirds retires the way that you want to retire and support your life so you need to have a plan and that's the first step in these seven steps\nIn a plan begins with understanding what you have right now and is it suitable inappropriate for the stage of life you're in you have the appropriate risk and that type of thing or your investments going to do for you what you think they're going to do for you and the only way you find that out is to have some research done for you and for that to be able to be proven out\nA through D good advisor and the second step that we talked about was making sure that you have an income strategy it does matter\nWhether or not you have a source of income during market fluctuations reality is that the market will go up the market will go down which you don't want to be in ... in retirement is is a retiree that has to sell a bunch of security during the downturn because markets eventually come back\nNo question about that and if you have solid income those market volatility seasons that we see their their whether it's a whole lot better on your behalf of you have a solid income plan and so few people have that so now as we get into this next segment here ... we're going to start with the third step and I'll tell you this is a big one\nThis is a huge step there's never been a better time to address this and this is creating a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement now most people think that in retirement you're the doctrines have gone away you can't do a lot about taxes but\nWe believe in and believe we can prove this to people than retirement unfortunately people do less planning but they have more control over how much they pay in taxes in retirement than probably any other point of their life\nAbsolutely so you need to create a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement that's the best time to pay the least amount of taxes and you can but only if you have a strategy that looks ahead three years ten years Fifteen and Twenty years the earlier you began\nThis strategy the better because through\nThe tax reform act um\nThese individual tax rates that we have now where taxes are literally on sale and your your bandwidth is wider that you can make a higher income still stay in the same bracket\nThere's opportunities for Ross conversions and other types of tax strategies that you need to take advantage of and each year that goes by and you don't you've missed out on that\nBecause these things are going to end in six to seven years so the\nEarlier began the better you need a forward looking tax strategy not one that looks back and re acts but one that's proactive\nAnd you need to think about required minimum distributions uh they're all taxable and it could double your tax burden and it's like a domino effect how day which you have to take\nHave effect on taxes on Social Security and all those kinds of things so you need to have a plan for this and what is your plan right now whoever you're working with are they talking to you about this and developing a plan that might be possible for you to pay less in taxes are you getting all the pieces of their retirement puzzle\nThat's very very important the beacon retirement blueprint that we utilize\nOne of the five pillars is having a tax strategy so what's holding you back from retiring right now well probably the fact that you don't have yet attack strategy\nWell and let me tell you why this is so big I was talking to a couple in and we'll call them a bill in in Tammy Knoxville and him enough to ... we were talking just the other day had about one point three million in an IRA and some other assets they worked really hard and we start talking about taxes and\nAnd I said you know a year and a great position you put money away and you saved and sacrifice than wise I said but that comes with some unfortunate news and\nThat kind of looked at me confused and I said you know you've got this IRA that you've got about one point three million is a that's the good news bad news is it's not all yours\nAnd they looked at me somewhat confusing they said what do you mean that's not all money goes we we worked for that we say for that I said yes but\nYou didn't save taxes you deferred that\nAnd ... as you start to take money out of account what do you have to do and he kind of looked at me and shrugged and said well I I have to pay taxes I said right\nIn taxes are like a debt and so what we did and we have some actuary software so the suffer was written by a friend of ours ... who's a renowned actuary so its factual and we can take that IRA or that defer to counter the total here tougher to counts and we can\nTake your current tax bracket and we can show you what your tax burden is going to be\nDidn't hear what it's like to run like a girl in today's heated political climate last year we march this year we run\nUnlike a girl from Westwood One mind on apple pie kept them from hot half or wherever you listened to your ... cat\nThis is speaking retirement strategies vintage on if you're ready to retire with confidence call right now\nThree nine five three thousand that six one

retirement or even talking about taxes how to save them\nHave put together a tax plan marketing economic race retirement income and much much more well\nIf you've been listening all show long and I sure hope you have we are talking about\nRetirement readiness how in the world can you truly be ready for retirement\nAnd um will you be working forever or maybe just think you will what's holding you back right now\nHere the seven steps here the seven things that you need to take care of nothing will happen without a plan so you have to have a solid plan then you need to have a pre determined and developed income strategy\nThen you need to create a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement gay and create a strategy for for withdrawing funds from your IRA and four one K. and what order how do you do that sequence of withdrawals\nAnd then create a strategy for optimizing your Social Security I Want to squeeze every possible dollar that I can and now we're on to number six and seven number six John is planned\nFor a long retirement yeah well you know it's pretty common nowadays Pete to sit down with people\nThat are had been retired longer than they were working ... my my grandmother is one of those people should be Ninety five and a few months or her husband was Ninety four last about five or six years ago my other grandmother passed away the same years my grandfather he was he was Ninety seven\nSo people are living a lot longer today you know and so you want to plan for longevity and there's a lady Emma Emma ... she was a hundred and Seventeen years young so hunters Seventeen from Italy she died in April of two thousand and Seventeen you know what her\nDiet was a no but uh you told me to a ... they are\nOkay I like to eggs one raw and one to ... every day in and cookie and the cookie and now I go to override anyway\nAnd in a few veggies thrown in a so you know if you live to your upper eighties guys and you know men today will sometimes lab they say well I'm not going to live that long well none of us are\nPromised tomorrow but even men are living longer today and women definitely if you look at longevity studies are living well into their nineties\nYeah oh I have a couple over in Mount Juliet and the family maybe listening on the radio today but the the mom who was Ninety four just died but the husband\nOutlived or he's he's still alive these Ninety three years old now he's he's still here but he's not as old as she was yet another year he will be in so I mean men do live into their into their ... even sometimes into their hundreds\nYes so the question is how long will your income last will your money last as long as you did\nAnd can you account for inflation on that and so really when you talk about planning for a long retirement you want to plan for a good long retirement\nAnd how do you plan for a good long retirement and you want to make sure that someone has done a longevity study where your income is sustainable it goes up with inflation you know talking to a guy recently who said you know\nWe're taking the same amount of money is out today is a war ten years ago but just doesn't seem to go as far well the reason as it goes first because of inflation and so you want to really planned for hopefully it will be a very healthy and long retirement for you and or your significant other\nBecause people are living longer and it's a it's a huge mistake not to do that and the uh this last point I was you know I Want to park on some today because I think now given where the market is some of the volatility we've seen and just as high as there's there's probably never been a better time to be talking about this next point and that is that your plan\nShould match your risk profile and that is a key an important question here's what you can expect to get from us the first thing we're going to do\nIs we're going to work up a customized retirement income plan that uses proven strategies that uses techniques that that are meant

inflammation of too much information um we talked\nAbout earlier the show obviously that is bad for you I think we all got that we talked about what causes it um which is really going to be your omega three versus omega six ratio ... too much you're making six is what's going to cost too much information so what causes\nWhere'd you get your omega six where you're pro inflammatory well that's going to be grain mostly it's grain grain veggie\nOil um grain fed beef um those are going to be your bad guys so but I Can't talk about a story about this really hits home with me\nUm and somebody might relate to this but a few years back ... how long has it been maybe ten years ago nine years ago I Want to having a um a tour my ACL in my left knee as wake boarding\nAnd us that my step may sale and um how to get a knee surgery that at a ... a full reconstructive ACL knee surgery um is an interesting\nInteresting surgeon I didn't do I'm such a hard core like no drugs then to do any pain medications afterwards and that was a tense and neglected I'm sort of it so uh [laughter] but I probably would not advise that number anti drugs but maybe in that one just couldn't do it\nUm I think it took about five ibuprofen total for for reconstructive ACL knee surgery is rough but he was so I Am ACL done and um the problem was obviously there's a lot of information that happens with any type of surgery and when they did that he's still surges you want a tightening\nJoined back almost like tighter than what it was originally I'm so just\nYou know even some walking causes a little bit of inflation in my knee and it was really interesting for about a full year I got to understand the power of inflammation and that was like if I ate a cookie him because again grain sugars those are the things that cause inflammation\nSugar is a huge cause of inflammation grains of huge cause inflation and a ... number one number two causes sure\nUm and so if I Would you be like a cookie the next day my new clicking and popping and painful I could only bend it\nUm and then I'll be real clean and then it would go away and then I Need a cookie or desert or whatnot pie I mean what am I might have been like a a birthday party or something my ... in the world why is my knee hurting so much and then I you know normally clean energy clean and to go away and then finally after about a year that\nWhat is the best to be on the radio dot has been\nYou know you're just out into the show when we were talking about in the nation is when they kill you are so many have you with our reading painting painting your fingers joints shoulders knees or elbows man if you're somebody to deal with heart disease\nMaybe you're on Staten medication you need to be paying attention to this show I'm Talking about exactly what causes the pain\nAnd we're talking about how to remove that pain first of all what causes it real simple inflammation is caused by eating sugar and grain no sugar will kill you we all know that um sugar and grain so when you eat it you said you're eating\n'em by the way the number of promises when we left to last segment what is the number one source of inflammatory I'm a food in your whole lifestyle by far in America can your guest what are you the number one source of information\nOr not grade Josh at green he's wrong um it it actually soda that you know that sodas and then one source of sugar in the United states but the worst part about so does not even say sugar it's fructose of sorts high fructose corn syrup it's in our sodas and they will kill you met is so deadly for a cause information you're a arterial wall\nUm it causes cancer cells as a matter of fact there's eight times as many receptor sites for\nUm sugar on a cancer cell as regular cell that's why when you go to get a cancer stand on a PET scan what they do is actually inject you with radioactive sugar\nAnd that radioactive sugar finds its way to guess what your cancer cells\nAnd then gives off that radiation so they can tell you where the cancer is because cancer loves sugar so in the ... not only does it cause inflammation it spurs on cancer is not good things that causes information also cause cancer\nI'm not good no boy do me a legal so what are we gonna do about it well omega three there's really you know five major things that we talk about 'em to remove\nThe information number one is fish oil we talked about again you want a good source thought super high in vitamin a we recommend world called Carlson cod liver oil we actually sold in the office I'm at a well health centers and uh we felt that what else will sell a really great kids one um they're all flavor they're called the robot the flavored say don't taste the the fishing is\nUm if you're familiar with

important reducing inflammation flak soil and then there's something we call Kirk humidity tumor Rick\nI'm not sure if you're familiar with that said like an Indian spice um it's very very amazing it's actually one of the number one sellers of ourself when was it was on her office I'm\nAt a well health centers is we have one called ... and basically what it is it's it's Kirk human tumor ... kinda the same thing and um what they do is a very very anti inflammatory people that take you wind up in particular have arthritis pain it will help to remove that in their joints um there's just no good you do not want it\nUm so I Love it I'm going to give a quick story here I'm of course one of our patients who came in the office to pick up I went to pick on Jimmy\nUm he's he's a patient he's he's been in a couple of histories reviews of a Jimmy somebody came in um he lives up in a scene lives up in a let's say and I believe so Jim you've got a real big Lafayette accent and I'm just an amazing guy just a great guy hardest on the radio\nAnd a Jimmy just he was on blood pressure medication um he wasn't feeling well and he's feeling older than he should got grandkids really pick up the grand kids you know didn't have that energy\nUm give blood pressure medication pain and yet the audio hurt me on the radio very skeptical didn't call for a couple of weeks he came in a wouldn't humidity office\nFirst thing we need shots that of X rays I can see exactly it turns out that he actually at a pinch nerves yet old whiplash who's a football player\nAnd um yeah the ... going directly to his heart to Jimmy there's your problem right there I think I can help number one your blood pressure better but number two is that can help your headaches and he said yeah but what about this uh the arthritis pain yet it in his in his fingers in his knees or ... or so we're going to work on\nNutrition so we we got him started on the you know food university that TV we had a couple of fitness challenges in the office which we're always doing something like that\nHe participated um 'course we shot in a very short amount of X rays we are out of time of getting him adjusted changes lifestyle probably really I'm Jimmy honestly is about six weeks or six weeks or shot as X rays are you actually is a fantastic\nSo Jimmy how're you doing he said listen man if I had just got to tell you ms ...\nThere was never said I got to tell you I'm so take a pay\nHe said I went to my a medical doctor and medical doctor said\nJimmy Boy your uh your um your numbers are looking great I think that we need to probably start decreasing you off of your blood pressure medication and Jimmy uses ... been the best part is that I hadn't been taking my blood pressure medication for about four weeks to stop taking the medication\nIs a medical doctor who was telling him that he's doing so good he needs to needs to stop taking medication which he already had\nIn the best parts he's changing his diet uh he lost about Fifteen twenty pounds I'm even to that point had been about six weeks she says my arthritis pain gone my headaches are gone he says I feel like a million bucks Jimmy is probably one of our best advocate for the office he's always refer people in\nThe so we want you to be like Jimmy if you're like that and you're like Jimmy and you've got you know headaches for back pain or maybe get a blood pressure issues you're dealing with inflation\nYou're ready for somebody to get around you and help you listen we're a Christian office we are absolutely excited to help serve you um we know that people right now are hurting and suffering you're taking medication that's going to kill you know blood pressure medication does not fix you\nUm it doesn't even reduce in your heart disease all it does is reduces the symptoms if your body's telling you that something is wrong it is using your blood pressure to get your attention something is not right\nIf blood pressure medication fix that problem maybe one or two pills or fix it or a bottle would fix it but it doesn't you wind up having to take how much of that medication all of it for the rest\nOf your life your blood pressure medication wind up not only just you wind up having to take more of it because it stops being effective\nIf you're tired of being on that rat race if you're tired of being on that\nUm that hamster

geologists say that area is overdue for\nA while I mean those close again seismic shift\nNow in plain English that means earthquake and that correction that the markets were overdue for well no one actually knows what that means that until it happens that's why whether you're retired approaching retirement or pushes the real maybe haven't even thought about it now it's time to get protection from that market volatility [noise]\nCalled chasing Evan ... hour of wood financial group eight hundred nine nine one seven zero six zero eight hundred nine nine one seven zero six zero [noise]\nCoach this has been a fast moving showed that stuff is that it\nIt absolutely had eating by now folks if you're just joining us I'm Thomas Lipscomb joined alongside coach Pete to root a winner of three ... to ... and ... now have to ask coach for those who may not know what is a ... award\nWell clearly is given to a best selling author ... and I was surprised\nWhen I got when it looks like a big golden feather okay yeah I can see it at our studio and then our offices we have two of 'em and I actually have a ring the best selling author ring wow which are that they maybe pay four times but I thought I was qualified to get it in the spring and looks like a Super Bowl ring decay it does yeah yeah and uh I got one of\nThe one of the ... at least for success or not mix with Steve for okay or the other one race those Avon baby steps he had one I Love ... wonderful\nLove the stories throughout it but the successor comics books with Steve Forbes is loaded with chapters on how people can make themselves better okay\nAnd Thomas we talked earlier on the show about the retirement ready to get we did I guess and make sure you retire when you're ready on your terms\nAnd ways to recession proof your retirement years now what does that mean to you when I say recession proof your retirement what does that mean to use the thirty two year old\nOkay so that makes me think that are in the long term when I Am ready to retire I don't have to worry if the market where to begin to thing yeah I'd have that confidence\nWell yeah because the recession and I remember my grandparents so this was back in the seventies nothing ever got thrown away food wise ... I mean my grandfather make chicken one day and the next day be chicken soup chicken something else to get to ... who knows like he would never waste a chicken absolute would take the chicken bones or the turkey bone\nAnd put it in a stew pot and make turkey sewers or you go yeah so it ended up making sure that everything that you have gets used the right way okay and unfortunately when we're paying fees so we don't need to pay ... you are in effect throwing that edible food away every single year\nYeah and if that food could have been put into better use or maybe you know get a lot more food with it so basically if you're paying the\nYou're losing the buying power for that money so we need to make sure number one rule of recession proof in your retirement\nIs make sure to have a fever reporter forensic the analysis to make sure you're not overpaying on these that's right and\nAnd a lot of folks maybe like throwing food away they thought oh it's just garbage ... you know anything else with\nIt so you look at a statement and it doesn't look like you have many fees right not statement where the fees are really show many times it's looking at the actual products and strategies are in and many times the fees are built in or they are in documents that you don't know how to read\nIt's incredible every time we talk about it I just don't understand how it will I really\nDon't have recession proofing retirement well it shouldn't it be something called the fiduciary standard where the advisor is supposed to put your deeds ahead of their needs that's right I've been practicing that for twenty five years since I started very but a lot of people don't so I like to put myself in my listeners shoes in what they are doing what they need\nAnd what would make me mad is would be paying fees that don't have to pay through that I don't know about truth right double play wrong thing I hear ya and so when we look at it we we want to be prepared\nNot surprising yeah every time it's all about the ... you can retire early if you get your ducks in a row the right way we need to make sure that we don't over analyze things we'd get a good team planners on our side\nThat understand what your needs and desires are and custom designed\nThe plan that fits with your will be for the very very important yeah we're going to talk about this and the next segment or in real detail but nine ways to protect your nest egg ... okay how your nest egg is money you're saving for retirement so about a bird it sits in the nest and it selects sits on the egg and it gets it all nice and warm and it finally hatch is ...\nBecause it's growing right right well you don't want it to be stolen or or crack before you before it ... and so what are becomes want to make sure but\nSome of the topics here we need to talk about is and who else out there besides a million new\nIs worried about rising healthcare costs\n... a magic many of our listeners\nNow it's a big enough war when we have a paycheck coming in that's right and you get mad about how much comes in and it goes out and I should think about retirement when you don't have a a work paycheck coming in and you still have now let me ask you this do to health care costs go up or down when we get closer to or to retire [laughter] I Would imagine they would begin going yeah yeah\nSo we are going to get into the way back machine\nWe're going to talk about the nine ways to protect your nest egg this is from a class that I taught back in two thousand and five\n... not about the time the radio show started by the way wow and so that's a long time by the way down but it is does it seem like it though if you enjoy what you're doing exactly so we need to make sure we designed plants that we have a transfer made of conversation okay\nAnd that's an informal usually private discussion in which two or more people exchange thoughts feelings or ideas\nBy spoken word often causing someone's life to be better in some important way and that's right from Webster's Dictionary right so a transfer made of financial conversation is from a dictionary here and we're going to go through all those ways ... ways to protect your nest egg we're also going to talk about the twenty two steps now we're in a debate step\nDuties all behind the scenes in three appointments but the total retirement plans\nAnd this is a way to retire with confidence many times to retire early but when you retire you know everything's going to be like it should because there's no guessing\nAnd there's no might happen that's right like when you talk to some advisors or here's some other radio shows the guy say\nWell if everything goes right into an certain things do happen you have about Ninety percent chance of everything being okay dangerous where it was what I don't like and I don't like all that stuff but the main thing that I have four is a hundred percent chance of everything coming out right is right so then it's not a chance anymore right that's right that's right\nAnd the chance to become a guarantee when it's a hundred percent\nExactly when something you said as well coaches you want to prepare for retirement of success not one where you have to take you know ... percent of your income like a lot of people tried to shoot for\nWell we end again yes we ain't for a hundred and twenty percent of your working income in retirement not Seventy percent of what we call retiring which success there you go not guessing and hoping for success exactly [laughter] and I I Love all these legal legal these things these days where people put disclaimer at the end where they tried to make a\nWell everything will be fine assuming no wait a minute and once you say that word assuming everything you just said gets a race to verbal racer examine other word is but exactly you know I Want you to have a great retirement but a a drink and you don't really want me to have a great retirement that yeah so we need to be concerned\nA lot of people are concerned about if they'll run out of money and retirement and so we need to check that off we need to totally eliminate that concern of running out of money and retirement but not just not running out of money but having enough money to do what we want to do\nWhen we want to do it that's right period mhm no disclaimer no but no uh most of the time all these other words\nNo data mining like I heard one guy in radio show say when we were talking about the way he was talking about four percent really had a caller call in and they said well\nA lot of visors say the four percent role doesn't work it rained down market right and so he proceeded to say well it works fine that up markets don't listen to advisor who talks about the bad thing ... what [laughter] so if if you've got to retire here's here's here's a good guarantee\nIf we reach retirement we have a hundred years of a market environment right where it will will the former several be fined you've never run out of ... and Wheldon\nThomas we've never had a hundred straight years up in any market so if you're retired you know Murphy's law strikes a lot of times and today you retire as the day the market goes wrong way exactly you know just so here's what I Want to do though very important we need to get educated we need to get the proper plan in place and we need to do with confidence and we need to be comfortable with our planner and are planning process\nSo we do this for everyone who calls\nAnd right now for the next thirty call where we're going to we're going to double the number callers will usually take at this time of the show for the next thirty callers\nWe're going to create a one page finance review\nIt'll indicate if you're in need of a full blown financial plan or not this is over nine hundred Ninety nine dollar value now what what also being quoted is this will take the mystery out of the financial planning process for you by mapping out where you are right now the most important part of any financial plan or planning process is having advisor\nHelp you figure out where you are right now financially that's right it's like when you try to go on vacation you need to work with your traveling in a car you need to figure out where you are before you get the map out of the matter is very true either you're thirty three years old I had a map yet unfolded never folded up the right way up you unfolded hey let's just\nBe real dumb apples loyal reliable than a lot of these electronic yeah", "show_name": "Michael DelGiorno", "year":
