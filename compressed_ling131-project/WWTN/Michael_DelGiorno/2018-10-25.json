say what I think everybody wants to say and nobody dared say out loud I have no idea who's doing these bombs my guess is based on the way it's being done\nAnd how sloppy I'll never forget somebody did a um a far right wing mean concerning ISIS on one of the bombs are these people have been so ridiculous\nWe're going to know who did this and we should know who did this within forty eight hours\nThat's how much I mean bombs are very specific they leave trails people rarely ever just start with bombs somebody's already got an they're already on the radar it let me tell you something you want to conspiracy theory if this isn't solved and forty eight hours I'm really suspicious there I said that out loud number one\nDo I have any idea who did it I Know why didn't Ken did you do it no

it [laughter]\nSome day you're going to weep me cope and beg for forgiveness just like Megan Kelly and I want to be watch no so I don't know who did it I have no way of knowing the ... the timing for me the fact that not one of these bombs have gone off\nThe fact that none of these bombs were sent to anybody who could possibly have opened them\nThink about that compare that coverage to the threat\n\nAs if you know Hillary I don't know if it's a pantsuit or pajamas and we can't tell when she's in public as if she struggles scratching her hip\nTo that mail box like you and reaches a oh

there's there's nothing that is a tactic\nI mean if this is really some goofball not you should be found within forty eight hours or I'm going to get really suspicious number one number two I find it very suspicious of the timing number three I find it very suspicious that none of these things have gone off and none of these things were sent to anybody\nThat would have actually opened them so I mean I'm just saying out loud what you would have thought the biggest threat to the Democrats right now is the blue wave is gone and the momentum shows are not going to get the house\n\nIt was said the last two started all this I mean that's what's the most shocking president comes it speaks against us and then what are they\nAre all lined up ready with their lines after all the president is Don in stirred up these words ring hollow what about Maxine Waters about Hillary Clinton I mean Hillary Clinton commenting yesterday\nAnd how we must all you know calm things down and elect people who will calm things she's the one that said we won't stop being adversarial\nAnd we won't be civil until we went by does in her words ring hollow what about the people sticking with people on Republicans are Trump supporters in restaurants\nOh the timing of this reeks the fact that none of these have gone off none of these one to anybody that could have possibly open them this reeks\nI thought to myself yesterday wouldn't it be hilarious because you know the one that they make the big deal I mean Fox off the deep end yesterday there's such a idiots if you think ... seriously if you go to bed

[laughter] not kidding she would never be that dumb which she\n...\nBut here's the bottom line and here's the real perspective I don't know who did it you don't know who did it could be a Democrat doing it to try to steer you know the biggest threat to the Trump rallies now they're trying to portray Trump is it is it an inciting danger is this a political stunt are these being mailed by liberals isn't that what everybody's thinking out loud\nBut even if it is some conservative not even if it is some right wing extremist group doesn't change any of the reality is at the facts who cares\nCountry still going in the right direction and needs to continue in that direction we still have every reason to support\nThis the way this is being covered makes me very suspicious that tying

in such a heated political climate last year we marched this year we run [noise]\nAnd I hadn't even thought of that on your Mormons funny to her which I Love\nThe name by the way is coming to poke theater AT T pack of this Saturday Night at seven thirty tickets or twenty five dollars if you've never seen Michael junior in concert you need to [noise]\nUm but you are more than funny and you know I was sharing earlier anecdotally I don't know if you're gonna appreciate this or not I thought your the way God because you know we forget our testimony is our most powerful message\nYou were writing a joke about the front room now I don't know if the younger generations relate to this but I certainly did and we were growing up all of our aunts our grandparents had that front parlor and as you describe but if you're a peek through the front door if you were the mailman of the milkman it looked like man that house must be incredible I mean all that great furniture nothing out of place it just looks\nOf course the rest of the house must look like that and of course the rest of the house is\nIs it is a mess a and you apply that spiritually to what we do when we put on our masking cultural Christianity and present are front room at church or in Bible study around other believers meanwhile the rest of our house are hard in this case\nA Jesus banging on the door saying boy so just let me and I clean the rest of this up to 'em but that's how you do more than any you tell funny stories but I'm telling you memorable powerful sermons love you brother can't love you enough I'm going to stop right after that comment while\nThere are some New Years so for the really call them more than ... it's because it's the same level of comedy that I've done on Jimmy Kimmel and NBC Tonight Show even to talk of the same level of comedy but in the middle of it there's always something a little more to goes down\nSuch as an analogy about how everyone has a good room and I mean a lot of good room in her life\nBut a God actually wants access to the whole house so you don't have that one room where where you're just doing certain things so that could show up in the middle of a show or it could be a clip of me in the woods feeding homeless people in the middle of the show and then we\nJump right back to the jokes so really kind of cool it takes people wanna ride that is fully unexpected\nLike Michael Jordan be clear by the way this this isn't new right because some of the greatest comedians of all time\nWould have an act that would take you through a journey of laughter but it had a message behind it your message happens to be eternal or really quite frankly\nPractical on family and love and love for each other the guy next to us it weren't that's hurting the guy we pass every day on the street I mean this this is always then would comedy was best to doing\nYes in in in the the truth is whenever you laugh you retain more patient\nSo why not put some like their people always say well after all was a little bit of a heart or make a deposit as something that's going to help people in a really Kuwait and that's what happened was more to plenty at every show is different I have no idea like I go up there with kind of a plan\nBut I'm also up they're listening in and asked the question what can I give to this audience and it's always until you every single show is different\nAnd it's so cool in fact last time I was in Nashville I just had a movie come out called more than funny the last time with the Nashville substance so amazing that happened on state\n... like it was so awesome I had mentioned it in my movie and retell the story but it was a schedule it's not even a joke but it was so powerful and I keep in mind a comedy show is Ninety seven percent comedy\nBut it's that three percent that seems to show up and really have an impact on people and I'm excited about doing that the natural\nYou know ... and you know yeah poke theater a tea pack Saturday Night twenty five dollars I got to go to the pact out or a click on events and uh you can buy your tickets I'm Michael junior joining us or the um\nThe theme in your life seems to be you know you're just you're being a good person you're doing the best you can to be funny I mean literally you'll sit down to write a joke and got all interrupt you and give you a sermon\nOr in the sea smear it interruption I can tell you that I have I I relate to that very seriously 'cause I can plan any speech\nAnd the reality is I'll never look at my notes and I have no idea what's going to come out of my mouth and I think it comes back to childhood prayers because I used to say to God I'd rather burp would balance literally Bert with annoying\nThan try to impress people with my eloquence so just using it and\nWe're while but but I'm like oh here's the gutters I literally\nI literally we're going to before I get on stage more times than not I'll say I want to show that ... would if I Need to fall on my face\nAnd not be funny at all and get booed off to room I'm okay with that and I I say that because there could be a world in order to guy in the audience contemplating suicide and if it had or let's say he's got played suicide because he had an embarrassing moment and then he sees me embarrass myself you might say to him so\nWell you know it wasn't that bad maybe I can\nCarry on that I like I don't know but I Do ratings for three hours a day I have ... folk at major events um I'll never forget I had I had every intention of delivering a national day of prayer\n[laughter] message that was uplifting and and and then it just turned into numbers and and I began to tell mayors and governors and everybody that was assembled at the blessings of God or not for everyone I mean I Can't help but not always very does to me but I can tell people in comedy\nIs very difficult to not walk out on stage and have an idea of where you're going and have got interrupt you and then trust him on the sly and go there and not only does he do his will he actually in your case I see a time and time again he gives even more funny material\nI mean I I ... sense of humor and he made us to be funny Michael but we also have a very important job and it was like\nWhat I meant the jokes were not submitted jokes to him he'll give me even better jokes like there is a joke on his latest comedy special about going to be doing it Saturday Night that is so strong [laughter] pain right after I said that right after I wrote a joke and it was like a I don't really want you to that I Can't\nFigure anything wrong with that you're just fully committed to him and there's a joke that I have I Would tell people what it's about would not get a whole joke I have a joke\nAbout um about being at the grocery store that is so wrong but it's the result\nOf of letting go of another joke\nThat I felt like I said hey I don't want you to I don't want you to present that last day at work all of a jury before I get it on the state\nAnd then the stuff that happened during the show is listen I literally in in California I did a show an act or security came to me they said this guy\nIs if you just have to talk to you really he's not necessarily you just have to talk to you so I'll go meet with the guy and this is after we've done to show people laugh and edited or the bunny between\nThe guy or something like ... uh one of those shirts like the most well sure but the muscles [laughter]\nWhat it is that a white threaten or like ... why are we going to beat her yeah\nYeah well aware threaten or ... yeah so\nSo I sit at a do or say hey what's up and he clearly has been crying like emotional\nExplains to me I Know you're not going to believe that some of your list will not believe the story\nBut he says to me that uh he came to this comedy show just to release everything that was going on in his life yes so much pressure\nYou said and then he lacked and it was okay lack a little bit and he had a good time but then when I started going deeper you said a mood I'm In such way and then he shares with me that he is actually a fugitive of law from Arkansas but he moved to California to to run from the law and\nHe said and I just I Want to know if you help me turned myself in oh my God I Want to get my life back together because I Know there's there's a purpose or something I'm supposed to do but I just happened to be talking about purpose at that show listening in between the gap saying what more can I get an audience and we turn that do it in\nThat's unbelievable like whoa I Know that's what I'm saying like it's like\n... ... and may I make the obvious transition\nThat's the definition of more than ... it's the more than funny to me with Michael junior he'll be at the James Cape poke theater AT T pack this Saturday twenty five dollars might pick to click for the weekend or I have three things one that you brought up that I think is a natural segue [noise] ah\nI hate you for this line and I think if you every time it comes up which is about daily [noise]\nAh [laughter] God can't give you what you need until you let go of what

hundred and thirty million people China and India have four times that many people we have to compete with them which means we can't afford that through any of hours away\nBen Carson is joining us secretary\nOf housing and urban development or urban development he's there in Nashville to uh to her first hand the next door recovery center then you bring you identify something very specific and it probably is worst dusting out because\nMost people don't really know how to get their arms around this opioid crisis and they they want to just go right to blame well doctors are to blame or this is to blame or that is to blame or politicians in the ...\nAh and then some people take a very sensible look at it and say okay it starts with pain\nAnd pain management and then becomes addiction but you're saying for many of the cases it really didn't even start with pain it started with hopelessness and trying to avoid pain which is emotional pain psychological pain as much as physical pain what are the percentage is how much of this if we dusted out the corners of the room and really understand\nWhy don't I don't know anybody can give you a specific a percentage on that but one thing that is so important for people that recognizes that it is extraordinarily easy to become addicted to have those changes occur in your brain can occur within a week\nAnd uh so often uh it it may be a sprained ankle but instead of five to seven pills you wind up with a whole bottle and are almost everybody has a family member or somebody in their circle of friends or acquaintances\nOr who has a problem and that gives you some idea of how prevalent it is if you go to the manufacturing part of our society you asked uh the the over manufacturing industry how much trouble they're having hiring people who can pass a drug screen it is an epidemic and that's why the president declared it\nAs a public health emergency last year so that we can begin to focus the or the facilities of the state and the people and the state because if we don't get this under control it has the potential to destroy our society\nYou know I went and working with the national rescue mission I was always astounded than that you know you would think heroin you would think cocaine you would think alcoholism and yet it was things like Xanax\nOr that we're feeling most of the beds and um and and it is it's kind of a a numbing self medication right oh yeah so you know you're also a believer to where do you think the root of this hopelessness is coming in\nWell uh there is no question that as a society we have a band in our Judeo Christian a foundation to a large extent and that was the foundation of your beliefs as\nI can I interrupt in it and say something to yeah we always say stuff like that right and then it it's just it's like it's become a narrative a talking point think about that Ben did you ever stop and think where would you be where would I be without that\nIn other words there's never a day that's gone by and I grew up in a very dysfunctional home around a lot of violence and abandonment\nBut I never felt downloads because I had a real relationship with God I never held without hope because I had hope I never lacked peace 'cause I had a piece that was beyond our understanding\nI enjoy a unspeakable I mean that's saying a lot we ruled eternal dice yes but you're also rolling the abundant life on earth that God had planned for us when you turn your back on him and as a country under God indivisible liberty and justice for all we have turned our back on him and replaced him with moral relativism any God no God doesn't matter\nAnd then he goes and and all I Do is I look around and I see people without hold\nDoing drugs drinking smoking marijuana suicide rate I could go on and on I mean you're a doctor if we were looking at this like a diagnosis the patient doesn't have an opioid problem the patient has a whole problem\nIt's a it's a disaster but it doesn't mean that we have to give up we can fix this and we're we're gonna have to be persistent and sometimes you know its darkest before the dawn a lotta times people have to think too low place before they realize where they are\nAnd I think we're getting to that little place as a nation right now and I think a lot of people are going to start waking up and realizing\nThat uh unless we reclaim our value system we don't I think that's going to happen but we have to get their first then so don't be terribly discouraged when you see all the things that are going on right now\nThey have to happen because we would have just slowly slid into a place of of no return had that not happen\nHUD secretary Ben Carson joining us real quickly the Trump Administration is combating the opioid epidemic\nOr the president a chapter shoulders and a lot of other shoulders and he's given the states a lot of powers in money uh there's a whole section on this that if if I just read it it would probably for some people are but it's a pretty comprehensive plan and a pretty big commitment the president's made\nHow in a nutshell would you explain what this administration is doing to address this because at the federal and state level right to what your touring today\nWe're we're we're looking at uh all the sources of the problem not not just the emotional pain that I just talked about but\nWhere the drugs coming from putting in place what we need to interdict those are drugs that are coming from overseas and things that are coming from South of the Ford wherever they're coming from a we're looking at the way that we provide health care\nBecause once those changes occur in your brain which can occur and less than a week it generally take somewhere between twelve and Eighteen months to reverse them with the right kinds of treatment so you know we're altering some of the things that are going on with age eight Jeff\nWith Medicare Medicaid so that we can provide the long term a type of care to actually\nBy

what we are very unhappy news to give you very unhappy news okay mc Donald's is removing its Happy Meal from its nationwide menu resulting in a price hike up about twenty five percent not by the way I don't know what what is let's say you're going to McDonalds\nUm\nTwo weeks ago we used to sit right across the street from Arlington Park racetrack in Arlington heights as you know I went to a handicapping school at eight years old with my dad and about four other good I'll never get Rudy arena Rudy arena looked like red Auerbach\nHas a little short guy he was at a cigar in his mouth the teeth literally rotted out in the shape of the cigar [laughter]\nI'm not kidding you ... and I said this room with all these guys smoking cigars and and I and we would handicapped I went to handicap and school at ... park\nBut that would take it that the biggest thing about going to McDonalds or dad versus mom mom you could order whatever you want dad he ordered for you and you always got small fries I always remember that that was cheap mom was good but we All right next door to McDonald's was Burger King\nAnd so we would drive in the dune buggy to the McDonalds we would sit and eat and stare at the one guy and Burger King and try to figure out who is that guy and why does he go to Burger King or if you go to burger that weird Hi those memories\nThat and I'm traveling there's just something about you know accepting and it gets quiet\nPulling in in a strange town to McDonald's yes and it always tastes the same no matter where you go and you sit and you eat and you stare at all these people living a life and their little town that you were you know\nSimultaneously is you're living errors right [noise] so there's something comforting about McDonald's for me I Know there's not a popular thing for people to talk about in this non fast food be healthy you're killing yourself age but I find it very relaxing to go to McDonalds\nUm the problem is McDonald's has changed so everybody pushing for minimum wage increases what a McDonald's to replace it with a kiosk now have you\nFirst of all they've made the kiosk so complicated I mean I Know I Am qualified to take an order at McDonalds I Know I can do it yeah\nBut they made the screen like if you want to add nuts to your Sunday I Can't tell you how impossible to find the nuts I even I turned to the lady I said I Can't find might not be nominated him and then I had the money and then they're not going to you know\nSo I'm I looked at my wife the other day and I said for God's sakes the next thing they're gonna do is they're gonna make me from my own hamburger I'm doing everything\nI'm getting my cup I'm filling my ice I'm filling my coke I'm getting my catch up I'm getting my solved I'm getting my napkins I go get my food I have to do the order myself I mean all of his left as I put a net on and fry right\n[laughter]\nKnow to my wife does this we think just to make us all feel guilty you know like what\nThe Mexican restaurant I'll do like a big burrito with grilled jalapeno sound Uh huh yeah and she'll get I'll have one and a lot of the cart one taco a card and it's just to make us feel like gluttonous I think\nSo whenever I go to McDonalds I get the same thing to get the quarter partner with cheese large fry coke Carlos Sunday with nuts that's it\nAnd I think about my dad I think about handicapping school I think about every little town I pulled off yeah and ... it's just a very very comforting thing for me my wife likes to put on the movie conjuring it comfort sir I like to go to McDonalds [noise]\nAnd then she orders are Happy Meal but no more\nConjuring comfort sir yes [laughter]\n[noise] isn't that odd Juno's it every day she puts the conjuring on while she cleans isn't it bizarre\nIt reminds me of when the kids and I used to drive around in the mini van I must have heard any seven hundred times but I've only seen that once there was always on behind [laughter] that's how it is with the conjuring I've never watched the movie I've no idea what it's about but I Know that dog barking is a bad sign\nIt [noise] but yeah a fast food chain\nHappy meals they're not going to have dollar meals two dollar meals in three dollar menu meals\nYeah\nHappy meals will now costs an average of twenty five percent more nationally according to the industry trade publication however the kids the meals may still be discounted at some locations but they're not going to be called happy meals so why would you be happy\nYou're paying twenty five percent slightly miserable [laughter]\nI'll have just slightly miserable meal yeah I've done a toy is like you know your your last checking account statement yeah I guess you look at all over you know\nTalking about going to those McDonald's in those small towns in the towns where there's only one McDonalds you see the high school football teams accomplishments all over the oil yeah it's a it's like a little ... it's a little mirror yeah like a little\nPeople into what goes on in that town yeah then you see the one guy I'll never get the one where we had an altercation hand ... Alex and I were coming back from New Orleans and we're sitting here eating as an Donald and also we're hearing screaming and ... and cursing oh yeah that's coming from behind the and apparently some\nGuy or attacked her yeah he he just he wanted more catch up her more barbecue sauce\nAnd and she wouldn't give it to him so she ... he grabbed her by the arm pulled her out and tried to punch or and then he threw his coke and her face yeah and ... member she lost it mhm yeah you then then out of everybody in the stores she come as the police are arriving", "show_name": "Michael DelGiorno", "year": "2018", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "25"}
