point of like\nI felt like it was three years right yeah they have any fifty one of the things I said when this happened was two things that I Believe our fact and the data would back it up I'm not going to litigate it right now because I don't have time and I want to get on to ... uh one sure first of all marriage is technically\nA biblical institution it's a covenant between the God man and a woman\nYou can get a piece of paper I don't think I don't live any day thinking about oh I I I'm married Andrew because there's a piece of paper that says I'm legally married her I never think of it as a legal document a contractor a business arrangement\n\nBut I'm I'm sweating bullets knocked not say goodnight to Jesus did I lovers you love the\nI fly ball it's over that\n\nAd during my children are the only covenant outside of God I have on earth making trouble right\n\nDear lord I looked at death either Lawrence funny today did I break a covenant with you and Andrea ... let me tell you something to things that would\nConvict you today should it should a convict me every day what's the one scripture everybody learns first well no second first as always got some of the world the game's only began so but after Matthew seek first the kingdom of God in his righteousness\nEverything else takes care of itself\nYou know that little simple scripture that everybody just says moves on to me oh it's in the air free night I go to bed God did ICQ\nFirst today did I even see you and everything today\nIf I got a job offer when my very first thought first thought\n\nWould it be how does this help me love you more how does this help me serve you better\nHow does this bring more glory do you\n\nDo you know what I was thinking a year ago when I almost went to W. are in New York what's that wow a million dollars a year\n[laughter] let's\nLet me tell you something it's held in my in my life I never get any recognition and I never get a raise\nYou will never see me and the Tennessee radio hall of fame ever I Know it I Know I Know my ... and you know why I Know it's I prayed it to be\nAnd you will never see me rich you know what I prayed a debate and I am so weak it might sinful nature God won't allow it to me oh I thought it was 'cause kids there is that too [noise]\nDamn routes Bristol where every is right now you don't ... brought me as I was wondering gift when I moved here\nIt was a piece of drift what an honor that said um how does it how does it worded children are pictures in your wallet replace the money is to have something\nTo that effect and it was so true and it doesn't matter what age just when you think oh my gosh these toys are killing me oh they got another get away from toys they get out of ours and honor fifty dollar nails\nYou know I Can't afford to golf I can barely afford to eat my nails need to be read on\nThat become an entitlement but I'm haunted at night by things thinks the first that kind of a guy\nWho thinks you know this is a tough challenges so um\nWhen we look it's a day um to me the priority as I say the last half hour was the\nMidterm election and there's no question the Senate almost seems secure I mean you'd almost you'd have a hard time uh blowing smoke up anybody skirt that there's any delusional way the Democrats can win the Senate\nUm the houses now swung in such a way\nThat I think everything I've been saying for a year is now twenty five days away from being a reality and I don't know what we're going to point to I Hope you point to a president who did what he said he would do\nAnd it worked and that results won out over a false narrative I think you can point to the Democrats obstruction and attacks and spinning in the face of the judicial process\nRule of law innocent until proven guilty and they went too far and it backfired\nOr the question becomes what will the reaction be if in fact this is true and I pray it will be\nFrom election night when all these\n\nPeople who created this false narrative once again create this false expectation and an election night comes and they feel like a rugs been pulled out when if they were a student in studying like we do and won't be a shock\nBut it will be them I mean if if you watched MSMBC every night and nothing else how different would you review of reality be let me repeat that 'cause I don't think you appreciate it\n\nHow much different would you uh reality be if you only read the Tennessean where if you only watch CNN a rabbi MSNBC and what would your false expectations base so regular that in a minute but I wanted to conclude with this thought\nIt's I think marriage is a covenant between God and man and um\nThat's very different than a piece of paper right now we have just pieces of paper and a cultural debate but to make a long story short brother Ken if gay marriage is only three years old here comes Rosie O'Donnell onto her third marriage\nAnd three years third in three years and it goes back to the point I was getting ready to make before I went on that long tiring\nAnd that is I don't believe the gays ever really wanted marriage they wanted to destroy marriage and its benefits they wanted to validate their lifestyle that I Believe they can't feel comfortable in their own heart with God\nAnd so they like to take it out on everybody else well you live in a country now that doesn't care if you're gay and doesn't care if you're married now what are you going to do now where do you take your discontent now where do you look for peace and validation\nKeep trying to fill your avoids with culture it doesn't feel it is the bottom line\nI also said quite practically that once you rebel against God I could say I've lived I've lived in windows arrive rebelled against God\nIt's very easy to thin very and once you do it's easy to keep sending\nSo in the gay community you have the most permissive us among us how's marriage going to work for them unless they're all swingers well I think you'd find in Rosie O'Donnell a dozen marriage has only existed for gays in America three years and she's already under a third wife\n\nAnd if anybody made a study of the you want to look at the trail of damage from hurricane Michael look it's a trail of damage of Rosie O'Donnell not just direct spouses but the children's lives that were destroyed and the wake of all of her storms\n\nOrlando anecdotally love there I mean love is love right let's celebrate it oh don't look there are two parents regardless of their sex is better than none\nReally might not want to make a study of roads these kids that was just driving me crazy 'cause I was just like I was thinking to myself\nThey've only had marriage three years and she's on door third Johnny Carson took three decades to get three it\nHe only had three yes you shut your mental fool ...\nWhy would you attach Johnny [laughter] I have I got and he only had three there are certain areas of this studio you realize by now or ... or ...\nI'm Sorry man I'm Sorry I I'll I'll look it up you\nKnow I don't bring up Ronald Reagan's second wife and you don't bring up Johnny three\n[noise] yeah I think it was three to Joanne stew by the way\nGod I miss Johnny [laughter] um\n[noise]\nAll right so here's the picture I'm painting for you\nIt's no longer my intuition or experience or discernment that there is no blue wave coming it's now twenty five days away and you can see it right on paper you can see it right on a map go to real clear politics what caused it well you can debate that\n\nI Would say that Donald Trump results beat the false narratives\nIn
