entered the synagogue\nBefore you give us a call anytime six one five three nine five three thousand\nSo John let's start out with our list in at the top is hidden fees are one of those major blind spots that people can have when they're looking at a retirement plan so when we talk hidden fees how often do people come in that you meet with how often do they just simply not know the fees that they're paying\nWell it is is the large majority of the time I mean once in a while they'll come in and they'll have a fairly good idea of what their fees are met a lot of times they don't [noise]\nAlmost everyone understands their their management fees in terms of what they're paying their broker and that's something that definitely runs about one percent but when we talk about fees were were not just talking about what you're paying your financial advisor or your broker we're talking about\nAll of their internal cost inside of the ...\nOn which is which is an add on to whatever you're paying your advisor [noise] so I Would say it's very\nVery seldom and then what I mean is there an average fee that people listening and go okay I I can I Know if I'm above and below that phase or a magic number there\nWell I mean it really depends on your investment structures what you have but I I Would\nSay that that the most people are are paying two to three times more than what they think are that's not always the case but in most cases they they are and you know when you when you think about\nWays that people can find out what their fees are that's a question I get asked a lot you know how do they know what they are well if you're a mutual funds for example and and they're certainly opportunity for that certain points\nThere expense ratio and there are twelve be one fees and transaction cost and where you find those are in the perspective is now I think people should read the prospect of says there's good information in there but most people when you survey them if you if you ask them what they do with their perspective is uh they may glance at them but most of them ... or they'll throw them away\nAnd what I tell them is that if they just look at the the area or section there's going to be a list the fees that they're paying\nAnd you've got to add those up and so if they don't know uh what those are are they don't want to read the perspective says that's part of the analysis that we do for people\nIs we can take someone's portfolio what they currently have and we can tell them it's not sort of pie this guy stuff for opinion It's MORNING star reports and things that are very credible we can actually take their portfolio which are loaded into morning star and it's going to tell us what they're paying an internal cost\nSo if for example just this last week I did one of these for a couple\nWho thought they were paying one percent that was actually there their managers fee which is the average um so I don't think that's overstated or anything like that but there are internal costs of their phones were one point nine sex so they're actually paying close to three percent\nUm versus the one percent that they thought they were paying and so there are ways for you to find out how much you're paying and you need to because the thing about paying too much and fees is like a double edged sword if your return is eight percent and your feet structures three you're netting five\nWell if the market's down ten percent and not saying the market's going to go down ten percent\nFees don't get wave and the bad years so they add to the last so\nFees and taxes and now we're going to talk about taxes later in the show today those are I Believe fundamentally to the biggest the use of your portfolio performance having too much in the ... not understanding it's a double edge sword and paint too much in taxes but you can in fact I Know what your feet structure is and you should know what you're the structure is very\nVery important so if you do find that out so you read read through your your documentation that you get on a monthly basis and you read through that you find out what can someone do is there a way to negotiate or to\nAlter those fees that they're they're being charged the train into\nWell yeah you can look at even if the sectors that they're in for example are sectors you feel like are are are good places for them to be you can look for other similar performing funds that are at a lower cost or you can look at certain investments that have a better\nTax efficiency or structure for a couple so for example one of the other things again and not to get into taxes what if you have a mutual fund what's the turnover how many times is their internal trading going on in in in the fund that you don't know about and so if you can have similar a return with a lower cost\nLower turnover fun if in fact mutual funds or where you want to be and there are certainly many other options\nThen you're probably going to keep more money in your pocket so if if two founders were equal in terms of performance and one was one percent last year going to have a better return because you're paying less than fees and so it all connects it's all very very important to understand those things\nAnd I I'd say an additional one percent back in your pocket is a is a big deal well you can go forward\nThat yeah so let's just calculate that for just a minute so one percent is not insignificant\nSo for example if if you have a half a million dollars that's five thousand dollars a year if you have a million dollars that's ten thousand dollars a year that would be fifty thousand dollars over you know the next five years it'd be a hundred thousand dollars over a ten year time period and so\nThe numbers really start to add up so if you have a million dollars that you could save one percent on and keep a hundred thousand dollars more in your pocket over the next ten years what could you do with that what would you do with that\nAnd so the numbers do they are not insignificant and so one understand what the percentages and they don't want to understand how that applies to my family and my situation\nNow that's good 'cause a hundred thousand dollars could buy a lot of must session through favorites to get along a lot of shampoo for us this call a team of baking Capital Management today six one five three and five

off medical driving the avenues just so they can now we can be more conveniently located for our Murfreesboro friends out there\nSo today we're talking about retirement blind spots and we've gone through several different things we talked about hidden fees not having affordable can tax plan not knowing your retirement number\nNot optimized in your Social Security income and we're ready for our fifth on the list and that is not factoring in longer life expectancy or simply outliving your retirement plan\nSo John I guess uh some people find themselves kind of maybe living in the past where they they can remember their grandparents or their their parents that they put together maybe a five ten maybe a stretch Fifteen year retirement plan and that's simply won't do any more because we've got people on retirement there\nNeeds to put together a plan of twenty thirty forty plus years mhm so when someone comes in how did you help them determine\nBasically how did they keep from outliving their retirement plan\nThat's the number one concern of people in America today it's been a couple of years ago now but Wall Street journal poll\nWhere they they pulled the boomer generation and they said how many of you are ... are highly confident that the plane you have today is going to get you know to retirement but through retirement supporting your lifestyle that survey said was that eighty three percent of the boomer generation that's a generational Seventy million strong retiring at about ten thousand a day in America\nThey were not highly confident and the truth is that there's no reason for that because you can be highly confident\nThat you're going to be able to sustain your lifestyle and you know it's interesting part of it just begins with with education and preparing people for the fact that that they could be retired longer than they're working we have clients now that have been retired and longer\nThan they were working and people are just living Laureano Nashville's and amazing community that health care that we have here is phenomenal the advancements in in health care across the board people were healthy they're active here\nAnd you know none of us are promised tomorrow anything can happen\nBut we want to plan for a very long a retirement and we want to have a good retirement you know Social Security for example when it first started life expectancy is we're we're handful years seven or eight years and now people start Social Security is sixty two and they're still taking Social Security and their nineties which is one of the things as\nThis put some stress on the Social Security trust and and that's a whole other topic\nBut you you really need to plan for a very long retirement in particular\nIf you're a healthy couple and let's say you're in your mid sixties there are some longevity studies that suggest that women in particular\nAre are going to live well into their nineties if they're relatively healthy and their their mid sixties and so but even for men you know I have a lot of men that will come in and see me they'll say well you know my father died at Seventy and I don't plan to live much longer than that\nAnd then they wake up one day and they're eighty or eighty four and they're still living independently and they're still you know talking about working out I I have a client who works out every day and he's eighty three years old and and you know he would turn circles around me so people are just living longer\nAnd so this plays into how you want to make choices on everything that you may you know we talked already about Social Security but you know if the the husband is the higher income earner\nYou a lot of times they'll look at Social Security choices for example or pension choices through their life expectancy but I encourage them if their wife is is healthy to look at things to their wife's life expectancy because statistically\nUs man you know I'm forty seven my wife has four days should kill me if she knew I was saying that on on the radio she's older she's rocking the cradle yeah but the reality is my wife is more than likely gonna far outlive me you know and your wife is going to far outlive you and so\nWhen I make choices on assets I Want to make those based on life expectancy is I have a grandmother who died six years ago she was Ninety seven I have one remaining who lives independently\nWho is almost Ninety five years old so you've got to plan for a long life expectancy\nTo John as you know inflation you know and two dozen ... at one point nine percent and\nIt's been a ... percent and two dozen sixteen into them Seventeen and the forecast is around that two percent mark again for two dozen Nineteen and twenty twenty so I I can only assume that inflation certainly plays a major factor when we're looking at making sure we don't outlive are expecting say\nSo how do you guys factored that in someone's retirement plan that's huge\nI mean it's absolutely huge and the question I Would ask is do you have a written inflation plant because that's something we do for every one of our clients because you know if your standard of living and I'll just throw number out there is five thousand dollars today I that's not going to stay at five thousand dollars I mean just think about\nHow things have gone up just in the last ten years I mean ten years ago it was a gallon of gas not what it is today how much how much was milk ten years ago five years ago two years ago you know things go up over time\nAnd you know when you talk about roughly two percent inflation been one of the things I'd add to that is that what the the fed tells us or the federal government tells us is inflation is round two percent and what they're talking about there and that is true\nIs core inflation but core inflation does does not include\nFood and energy and so if you think about someone who is retired water to the biggest line items to your budget while their food and energy you don't retire and stopped going to the grocery store fill your car up a gas when you travel\nOr pick the grandkids up you you know you don't stop heating your house in the winter ... and the summer so food and energy our\nOur massive budget line items to retirees and that anyone in America so when you when you add those and we believe true inflation is much closer around four percent and so\nWhat I Want to make sure of is that I have a written income plan I have a written inflation plan that if my expenses are five thousand dollars today that is going up\nFor a true cost of inflation or my spending ability at a later point in life and so that that's really really important and you know another factor to this whole inflation conversation is is health care\nOr that the fact is that health care is going up in America about four times\nAnd they can make a choice whether you're comfortable with that or not and sometimes\nPeople will say I'm very comfortable with the rest that I have and and there's sometimes people say wow this a lot more risk than what I thought that I had so if you did have more risk than what you thought you had or what you were comfortable with at this point\nWhen would you want to know about that would you want to know about that now when you could still make choices or would you want to know about that down the road when you've had little or no choices that's what a risk analysis\nDoes so why do you think it's so easy to kind of neglect preparing for risk when when we're kind of in this bull market what makes it so so hard to just sit down and look at the\nRisk well a lot of it as emotions I mean del bar is one of the most leading a research firms out the studies investor behavior and\nYou know people are very emotionally driven or they feel really really good and you fork almost when the market is going up and feel really really bad when the market is going down and they they want to believe that they they buy low and sell high but for most people they they buy high when they're feeling comfort and they sell low when they're feeling pain and\nWe think that any investment decision made out of fear out of emotions is a bad deal for the consumer you should never do that with bacon or or anybody else\nBut you know it's it's one of those things that if the market is doing really well you feel like it's always going to do really well and markets are not designed to just go up forever and or they designed to go down forever I mean\nYou know uh it's usually a once in a while we'll have some of them come in and say well you know I was got this email the other day and somebody was telling me how I is the economy is going to crash and burn it\nAnd I should sell everything I have and buy a bunch of gold coins or something like that and or they've got the perfect place I can put all my money and typically what you'll find somebody that selling a newsletter or book or something like that there there is no perfect answer or what needs to happen is you need to understand your risk and if there is a downturn\nAnd you're retired or you're close to retirement your income going to be there because what really hurts people in retirement in my opinion is not market downturns because those happen\nIt's market downturns combined with the loss of income or having to sell securities when the market is really low so if if I have a good income plan I'm not having to sell my risk based assets\nAt a low and I'm probably not as concerned if I Know I've got income coming and so it all kinda fits together but it is important to understand that risk\nWhat you mentioned this a little bit and ensuring that question and it brings us to kind of lost the blind spot on the list\nAnd it's a big one is procrastination I'm this is this is such like you said it's very common common\nParticularly when there's a bull market we're in it's common for people to be looking to to make a change to to give that extra measure of preparedness on their plan and so I mean I Believe all the folks tuned in today show would agree that retirement planning is extremely important or they simply wouldn't be listening to the show because I don't want to just hear a pretty voices\nSo why is it so easy for them to stay on the sidelines when it comes to\nRetirement planning and not just jumping in and and kind of grabbing the bull by the morning going on I Want to get this right I Want to be very ... and when my plan well\nI I think there's a lot of reasons for that I think you know first and foremost in a life gets busy um you know I've got three young boys ah that that all play soccer and a family and ... and obviously work in my church and\nYou know generally speaking people are are incredibly busy um but they also kind of feel like I'm you know there's there's so much information they ... they don't know how to dust\nI've heard all and that's why planning takes you know time it's not an immediate decision with us or anyone else or certainly shouldn't be I think a lot of it is is a lack of understanding that's why I Believe our process is is unique in the sense that it's about educating people about getting data into their hands\nBecause the truth is we want people to understand what they have and what options they have it regardless if they do business would be can or

here and I got a great show they were talking about the information [noise] um and we're talking about it was killing you cancer heart disease or arthritis of decreasing their immune system you do not want inflammation of\nToo much information um so we talked about earlier in the show obviously that is bad for you I think we all got that talked about what causes it um which is really going to be your omega three versus omega six ratio ... too much you're making six is what's going to cost too much information so what causes where'd you get your omega six where each or pro inflammatory\nWell that's going to be grain mostly it's grain grain veggie oil um grain fed beef\nUm those are going to be your bad guys so but I Can't really talk about a story about this really hits home with me um and somebody might relate to this but a few years back at how long has it been maybe ten years ago nine years ago I Want to having a um a tour my ACL in my left me as a wake boarding and that's not\nMy step may sale and um how to get a knee surgery that it ... a full reconstructive ACL knee surgery um it was an\nInteresting interesting surgery I didn't do I'm such a hard core like no drugs and it do any pain medications afterwards and that was a ... if I'm sort of so uh [laughter] but I probably would not advise that I'm very anti drugs but maybe in that one just couldn't do it\nUm I think it took about five ibuprofen total for a full reconstructive ACL knee surgery is rough\nBut anyway so I Am ACL done and um the problem was obviously there's a lot of information that happens with any type of surgery and when they did that ACL surge actually wanna tightening that joined back almost like tighter than what it was originally I'm so just you know even some walking causes a little bit of inflation my knee\nAnd it was really interesting for about a full year I got to understand the power of inflammation and that was like if I ate a cookie him because again grain sugars those are the things that cause inflammation\nSugar is a huge cause of information grains a huge cause inflation and a ... number one number two causes sugar 'em and\nSo if I Would be like a cookie the next day my new ... clicking and popping and painful I could only bend it\nUm and then I'll be real clean and then it would go away and then I Need a cookie or a dessert or whatnot pie I mean it would ... might have been like a a birthday party or something and my ... clicking to pop in the world why is my knee hurting so much and then I you know normally cleaner it'd be clean and to go away and then finally after about a year that\nI realized oh my gosh\nThe reason that I'm having all the issues because of my inflammation and honestly to this day\nAnd it's been nine years later if I you know started jumping up my diet with a bunch of grains and sugar my knee will start clicking popping it's a very real thing so I Know there's a lot of people at home right now they're like oh man maybe that is me you know I'm hoping there's some light bulbs that are going off\nOf what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and called trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nCoal trinity one eight hundred three eight three oh six eight seven that's one eight hundred three eight three oh six eight seven\n...\nWas the best to be on the radio dot\nYou're just out into the show when we were talking about in the nation is what made you kill you or somebody to do with our\nReading painting painting your fingers joints shoulders knees or elbows man if you're somebody to deal with heart disease maybe you're on Staten medication you need to be paying attention to this show\nI'm Talking about exactly what causes the pain and we're talking about how to remove that pain first of all what causes it real simple inflammation is caused by eating sugar ingrained that sugar will kill you we all know that\nUm sugar and grain so when you eat it says you're eating\n'em by the way the den where I'm at promises when we left to last segment what is the number one source of inflammatory I'm a food in your whole lifestyle by far in America can you guess what are you the number one source of information or not grade Josh that green he's wrong\nUm it it actually soda is you know that in sodas and then one source of sugar\nIn the United states but the worst part about sodas not even say sugar itself ... of sorts high fructose corn syrup it's in our sodas and it will kill you met is so deadly for a cause inflation you're a arterial wall um it causes cancer cells as a matter of fact there's eight times as many receptor sites for\nUm sugar on a cancer cell is a regular cell that's why when you go to get a cancer stand on a PET scan what they do is actually inject you with radioactive sugar and that radioactive sugar find his way to guess what your cancer cells\nAnd then gives off that radiation so they can tell you where the cancer is because cancer loves sugar so obviously not only does it cause inflammation it spurs on cancer is not good to things that cause inflammation also cause cancer\nI'm not good no boy do me a legal so what are we gonna do about it well omega three there's really you know five major things that we talk about 'em to remove\nThe information number one is fish oil we talked about it and you want a good source not super high in vitamin a we recommend one called Carlson cod liver oil we actually sold in the office I'm at a will help centers\nAnd uh we failed out what else will sell a really great kids one um they're all flavor they're called liberal but the flavor to it don't taste the the fishing is\nUm if you're familiar with liberal they taste disgusting but this these are pretty awesome\nWe feed them to the kids and so we do\nUm smoothie skies if you're a smoothie recipe I'm every morning I a smoothie and it's not a movie that's full of fruit and junk that's

save protects\nThe deferred retirement get a building up money for their paycheck to have a better retirement and matter of fact a lot of my teachers that I work with retired early because of that wow there you help them save some money that they would have spent one teacher wants told me\nIf it would have come home I Would have spent it so it came out I Wish I could touch it went into retirement

well to be honest it's about it's harmless as one geologist say that area is overdue for a while I mean those quotes again seismic shift\nNow in plain English that means earthquake and that correction that the markets are overdue for well no one actually knows what that means he'll it happen that's why whether you're retired approaching retirement or pushes the real maybe you haven't even thought about it and now the time to get protection from that market volatility\nCalled chasing Evan ... hour of wood financial group eight hundred nine nine one seven zero six zero eight hundred nine nine one seven zero six zero [noise]\nWalking back into financial safari consumer advocate\nThomas let's come here with you in Studio alongside the coach America's wealth financial and income coach coached Pete the ruder he is a best selling author winner of many awards including ... again like I said earlier in the program I could go on and on in Studio with us as well as Chris the rocket man brought our now\nCoach you were talking about financial dignity before the break and it reminded me I'm going to uh open up and probably get left out a little bit here [laughter]\nWagon again and yet when I was a a precinct and so you got to think like eleven twelve year old Thomas\nAh there was a band called ... and that was a very popular back in the day that there were these kids they all had long hair so I had grown my hair out because I thought it was cool and trendy fad\nI go into a gas station one day to pick up a bottle of pop bottle a coke or whatever and the ah clerk their refers to me as a female instead of the ... cut my hair the next day some little dignity example there just to kick off the segment how how\nHow long your hair time and it was about down on my shoulder and I've seen pictures would you would not much here at all you have yeah is that do they after the episode\nThere you go [laughter] or tablet like Saddam ah your dignity that right that's right\nWell yeah it's it's on again your terms so financial dignity though either doing what you want when you want where you want with whom you want that's financial dignity and we see so many people every single week they'd come in from the show we talked to him\nAnd they are wondering if they have what they need put aside and places they should have to get to retirement they want to have\nAnd unfortunately well fortunately or unfortunately unfortunately sometimes they don't\nBut fortunately there are there are thinking about it so that we can get them on the right path we call it a critical thinking\nAnd its benefits we look at the benefits of of what what you're doing right now versus the benefits of something you could be doing ... and that should I mean so it's features advantages and benefits and why would you make a decision that didn't benefit you completely and as much as it more of than anything else out there yeah\nI I Would imagine it's just not making the true comparison not not nearly being educated\nWe go through what we call the financial stress tests with every single item that is in your current portfolio while and then we compare that to what we would recommend is independent financial produce years we can go out across the world and find things that makes sense to you one of the things that are largely I keep seeing it over and over again from people that come in from other planners\nIs these other planners are pushing like crazy these days something called a real estate investment trust otherwise known as a wreaked okay for the call rats before too and that was that a real estate investment trust\nIs when they're being pushed by financial professionals they get a pretty good commission see that's why they wished that and many times it comes right out of your return oh okay well if you are right out of the money put in so let's see what a hundred thousand dollars into a real estate investment trust\nAnd the person you're buying it from is not a true for do Sherry the hundred thousand dollars you put in Ninety One thousand or so goes to work for you guess where the other nine thousand Ghost Wars a gift dominant humans alive person sounded\nA hook hey that was that makes sense you know in\nOther words that's immediate loss now you have for the year right unless it I mean what's the real estate goes up like crazy now here's the thing that that's bad enough that I think you agree that's bad isn't it a risk does that make you met day does it does I mean that's almost ... percent right now I went to Harris Teeter shopping center to buy a half gallon of ice cream for five dollars\nYou give the person five dollars of in of course tax gets up there to see how you get to the person five dollars and fifty cents and what they do is they take your gallon ice cream to take this big knife you see like a ginsu knives [laughter]\nRemember these to cut through the cans with it yeah and then the cut through a tomato I remember the state the ginsu knives out and they take a tape measure out in the measure one fourth of the ice cream\nAnd they cut it off a hold on to attack and then they put the dripping part of that's left the big three fourths into your bag and a drift over everything up they take that one fourth and they start eating it right in front of you that's equivalent what happens when the person takes a fee\nAnd edit out of your money that you're trying to best well that's a really good at night they slice outlay slice of the money you put in land somebody goes in their pocket some of them do and yours while and so but that's bad enough but another thing is when you buy these real estate investment trust\nThey are ill equipped for the most part they are non traded really hurt us you've heard the phrase non traded ... have you heard that I have yeah and probably when I met when I'm Talking about you for me you know yet what about you know yeah into that but yeah\nAll right so non traded means if you buy it you can't sell it was right or locked okay it's like\nWhen you buy silver and gold now but it's but silver gold at least is liquid because you can sell it back to the person you bought it from short hair loss yeah sure you buy it for a hundred dollars and they'll say well why we buy back from you for night [laughter] I might as much as they should and they say so they may commissions both ways okay yeah so be very careful if someone is peddling\nA real estate investment trust ask them why and say how does that fit in what I'm trying to do okay sure because they're taking advantage many times of the fact that people know they were they want some real estate near portfolio\nAnd if you want real estate go buy some real estate you can sell tomorrow that's what I was going to add and we\nWe hear a lot of people who take advantage of the rental situation ... is very different than okay\nSo we've got this chi chi that you can use to end its low gosh one two three four it's got six main topics in each each of those main topics has eight sub topics Mm So forty eight different sub topic wow and six main topics but then to be because you need to go to just before you buy something you've never heard of ... like a real is\nInvestment trusts earlier yeah and one of the things that you have to say what what is that what are the strength and what are the weaknesses of that\nBecause many times when people come in and show us what they have all they've heard about the strikes a which is hopefully this will go up and value can sell for a product that what we're doing not liking it then it's yeah the maybe the hospital I said hopefully hopefully yeah\nYeah I'm a ... you could have got to put the bell but some people said you said\nMaybe say can act on hopefully\nYour fun to play with a ... foot high so\nBut it's not joking better people are getting into these they should get into that and a lot of that money's money they need to have liquid in a couple in the future maybe five years ten years there's no guarantee that money ...\nAnd there's no guarantee that money will ever go up and say we seen a lot of people lose a lot of money in real estate investment are going to ask me about safe about that okay at least if you buy real estate locally and if you if you negotiate a good price\nAnd maybe you get some people in there that are renting it from you can always get some income generated from there but if you go if you're buying the ... you're in a big pool of other people buying these big buildings or or these these commercial properties and there's no guarantee that they will say what they went up yeah it sounds like your control just dive um yeah\nSo you know Amazon has chicken a lot of people's but these days and so if you buy a shopping center and it's based on retail shopping and Amazon announces are going to have even better deals all those companies get St business yeah so then that property now that was a hundred percent or Ninety percent\nTaken nonfiction occupied when you bought the ... now becomes twenty percent taken or eighty percent vacant ... oh there goes your money no doubt you know so you'd be very very careful that no I didn't mean to talk about that as much as I did but that was something that was on my mind\nAnd then when is this acceptable and unacceptable to own that's another question so again who what where when why and how are all questions to ask\nAnd then when they say you want to pitch in the real estate investment trust you say how is the similar to blank you know you're trying to you you said it's going to generate income has a similar to a new ...\nEven close to being somewhere to knew what he knew he'd given certain annuities guarantee certain strains of income for the rest of your life is to get the right one okay and starting to do with these don't have these that come out of your pocket and the broker doesn't make money\nOut of your money in certain annuities and every single read I've seen the if if a person has a broker selling it they're making some commission out of your money while now you can you can buy a ... from an investment advisor they cannot charge money out of your money so the money you would have lost goes to work for you and the rate\nBut still the rate has a bunch of disadvantages where it's not Lakewood anymore and you could you could lose money so uh what I've seen by talking to people is the people that are selling these rates don't go through the\nAdvantages and disadvantages they they're they're very quick to go through the advantages right and very quick to forget to tell you about the disadvantage that I Do not like that but he was on to do if you are with the next ten people will call who have at least two hundred thousand safe retirement will go through our own and your own strategic development process", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael DelGiorno", "city": "Hendersonville", "day":
