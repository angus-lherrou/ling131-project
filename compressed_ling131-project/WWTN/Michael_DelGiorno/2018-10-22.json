what's best for business and what's best for employees and he and the secretary of labor have a\nAn amazing announcement about association\nRetirement plans and joining us is the United states secretary of labor Alexander Acosta Mr Secretary good morning and thanks for joining us\nGood morning Michael I got to tell you something I I was actually shot just about thirty eight million private sector employees in the United states that don't have access to retirement plans and I wanted to start with you too from a business standpoint yeah this is important of our our Social Security we don't know what it will be how long will wait\nI'm In that kind of a thing but it'll probably on average about forty percent of all of our retirement and then the rest of it it relies on our four one K. and that's prioritizing savings but was never talked about with the four oh one K. and I try not to touch it and I never will touch it and it will will along with Social Security\nBe my retirement so I'm not a burden on my children but it is also a safety net for those bumps in the road in life as well um that is so important and so we want people to have acts\nAs to this and a simple solution is one we have found in the insurance a dilemma as well and that is letting businesses band together and increase their pooled explain to them how it works and and how it works now and how it will work now with\nThis new association retirement plan\nYou know Michael you're absolutely right there's so many American mainly those working for small and mid sized businesses that don't have access to retirement savings account in in fact only ... percent of small businesses offer for one cave to their employees\nAnd so what we're doing for our proposal today is if we're saying what if small businesses that could all band together for a chamber of commerce or Britain industry association and as a group offer a four oh one K. plant their employees\nSo instead of the corner grocery store having to set up a four oh one K. and do all those filing and a quarter restaurant setting up another four one K. and doing all those filing what if all those small businesses\nIn in Nashville or throughout Tennessee or or elsewhere could get together in one large group you know you're going to save a lot of a lot of effort on on the the red tape and the bureaucracy\nYou create scale so a typically a small pro one K. is charged about almost one quarter per se but a big for one have charged a quarter of a percent so you're saving one percent every year what would that mean to retirement savings\nOver a lifetime yeah I'd love to have that answer or it depends on the participation level and the income level but it's significant\nUm you know we we did this with insurance because what does it do well is it changes the actuarial pool that's what it does\nA ... and that was the problem with Obamacare what it did was it took some most vulnerable the sickest and the poorest and created an actual real poll I didn't even need to play this exercise out Mr concert to know that this was going to be a premium nightmare\nUm but that's why we band these things together a explain to us by doing this\nVersus let's say because even an individual and small business going to a Ross IRA why is the four oh one K. such an advantage even over that I I Would think in terms of attracting talent in keeping talent and preparing them over a lifetime for their retirement so they're not a burden on their children are not a burden on society\nIt it's really one of those all of the above and that's what makes my question I have only done this sooner\nYeah I I have no idea why we haven't done this you know it needed to be done to president in August asked me to review their retirement savings options and and and generate way to provide more access and that is what we're doing he thought the president signed an executive order on August\nI'm directing me to do that and and\nLook you you you're absolutely right Michel ... or try and prove it we're not creating something near retirement accounts some new gimmick that said you know to save money we're taking with tried improvement and accessible to Americans working for all those large corporations in saying the Americans working for the small businesses\nShould also have access to death and work and make it easier for those small businesses by banding together in one association so instead of every in a way that small business owner opens up a business they don't do that so they can file government documents that they can become plant produce Sherry so they can do all of this\nThey're operating their business we want to tell them operate your business\nReally sounds like the opposite of this marker\n... eighty eight

have\nOne we have what do we have Madam Secretary for you we have a republic if you can keep it because it relied on self governance it relied on a moral people it relied on virtue in self governance these are the only time I was just going to say I'm speaking\nAbout ten and two hours in Fresno no joke\nKind of go on and try and go freedom and if you can keep it is what I loved about your book explained the golden triangle to freedom even if there's an atheist listening what's in it for him\nNo this is this is I'm I'm literally going to speak about this subject\nIn an hour here in Fresno,

faith and faith in term requires freedom I never understood that what do you mean by that I'm asking asking if he wrote about it in his book\nA free people suicide what he means\nIs freedom which is self government real freedom which means you're going to govern yourself you're not going to be governed by anybody you're going to be the government you're going to govern yourself how could that work the only way you could work is if people have virtue because a virtuous people can be trusted to do the right\nThing if people are bad they need people above them to govern them to keep them from committing crimes and abusing power and whatever but if people are virtuous effectively speaking they can be trusted to govern themselves with the tiniest oversight from any government you have a small government and I thought to myself that's the concept\nThat the founders interested to if they said we're going to let the people choose now imagine a level of trust you must think pretty highly of the people if you think that people are going to do the right thing\nSo you need virtue virtue and this is where it gets crazy you can't talk about this in public schools today by virtue according to the founders requires said in other words not everybody's going to be a born again believer or serious Catholic or whatever but you need a kind of\nUh you you need an a number of citizens that significant who are serious about their Christian faith and understand that the answer to a higher authority if you answer to a higher authority you will be virtue if you don't need the government
