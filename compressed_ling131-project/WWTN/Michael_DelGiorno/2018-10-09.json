comes the recently eliminated\nCleveland Indians David ... out to the mound um [noise] well what\nCan I say uh this is obviously the breaking news of the day Nikki Haley the former governor of South Carolina and the UN ambassador for the United states has just resigned and what makes this story unique is that things couldn't be going better\nNumber one a number to ah they choose to do it in the White House was two chairs and a live television announcement and then queuing day that's different\nThird her impeccable resume or makes it hard to believe that Nikki Haley has nearly stepped down to impose term limits on herself\nUm this is somebody that could uh you know if we were in a golf cart this is how the conversation would go David are you there\nWhy am I not hearing David you gotta turn the phone and that's why turn the phone on\nThere we go like no way to go and wonder and the ... just didn't have this ...\nThat yeah I'm All right Nikki Haley um\nI could do any number of speculative scenarios or if Mike Pence is going away she would certainly make sense out of the ticket two years from now with Donald Trump if Donald Trump goes away she certainly makes sense at the top or the bottom of a ticket with Mike Pence\nAnd Lindsey Graham is about to join the cabinet she makes a great sense in South Carolina to take over that Senate seat and withstand any elections that followed so\nUm I you know I you weren't watching you were listening I was watching and listening I buy that the president did this because he knows he has an enemy in the media and he's refusing to give them any opportunity to spend is what I don't buy is this is self imposed term limits on Nikki Haley but maybe I'm wrong maybe you do\nKnow I did watch and and that you're quite right or I didn't catch some of it uh this is clearly first off this is managed\nAnd it's been managed while suffer the people who are looking at the ministry and considering that it's out of control but it's somehow or nothing but the spontaneity of whatever Donald Trump workshop with a new world each day it was not not at all\nNot at all you can notes that from the results\nBut more significantly from from the situation like this my first off with a look at the position that the UN ambassador we've had some outstanding un ambassadors that had been very\nDominant in the public policy debates over the years kind of Lisa rice Jew ... others that have been substitute and this is a position that gives you a platform to speak to the nation for a lifetime\nAnd Nikki Haley is executed that well she contends that she let the president on the bench for two years that's also not unusual it's not the kind of job that you tend to eat\nFor a lifetime especially as young as Hayley is and that she comes from the background of being both a legislator in South Carolina and a governor she is a policy person more than she is a representative spokes person\nThen I can I give you a tough question you can't answer it it's a question that the media asked All right why would you make this announcement now are so maybe it was\nYears self imposed and had the announcement come in January but why now right before a midterm election\nWell because she had made the person or know that she's going to start 'til the end of the year\nAnd so let's get it on their lips get out of the way and I think that it also gives Donald Trump or refreshing look\nAt um the the fact that all the stories about women in his administration and the whole cabinet effect aren't the whole story about Donald Trump and people around him and women so there's a refreshing break in the news story for this it helps him in mid term elections and then it does give us a chance to speculate\nHello this is Chris moslem with Marlins optical

people\n\nAnd if the war the steel sword is about women and you\nPut a woman on your ticket that would certainly makes sense so to explain the speculation something's up with Nikki Haley successful governor now a very historically successful US ambassador she now is executive chops because let's face it president United States is an executive position\nExecutive experience as a governor and now foreign policy chops as a very successful ambassador she becomes a very very\nPowerful female resume for the highest office in Atlanta and I think she was treated that way today I don't I Do buy that the president did this so that no one would speculate sorts of it so he wouldn't turn it into hate women hating say\nThere's a woman after this Kavanaugh thing or maybe there's a foreign policy difference you know all the media likes to create straw men and then shoot him\nI Do believe that's why he did this the other reason he did it as her future and I don't buy that its self imposed term limits from her\nBecause the toughest question to answer today is clearly she wants to leave at the end of the year clearly it could leak but it hadn't yet you meet it had a but why did you do it before the midterm why would she resigned before the midterm\n\nIf I had to flip a coin I think you're going to see my parents go and Nikki Haley beyond the vice presidential running mate for Donald Trump in a re election\n\nBut I Am not ruling out that if there is no blue wave and if things continue on the trajectory there on foreign policy and domestic prosperity wise that Donald Trump live accomplished his mission and would be glad to leave after one term removed their biggest gripe him\n... that's a real irrational reality we have today the Democrats are out there saying this is a referendum election on two years of Donald Trump what a reference referendum election on record unemployment\n\nRecord employment rather record low unemployment record GDP record now I mean what what is your North Korea is no longer on the brink of war they're coming to the table Iran's imploding ISIS has decimate I mean what do you what's your referendum\nFalsely accused men with no evidence no corroboration and all refuting witnesses went on to become a Supreme Court justice has he showed up based on merit\nWhat's the referendum Trump they don't like them\nAnd if you're Donald Trump I don't know if we're thinking I mean nobody wishes death on any Babe Ruth Bader Ginsburg by numbers is eighty five years old she looks very frail\nI don't think she can\n[laughter] um I don't listen to point out that I maybe I didn't bring it back up I Know I did it in the immediate recap but yeah ... or the other thing I mean there there are two things that make me not think Nikki Haley said as the United States Senate one is the specific question which by\nDon't think anybody was speculating Lindsey Graham other than ... why but for those that were speculating Lindsey Graham with time I'll take the momentum from his cabinet hearing performance\nAnd plop himself into the Trump Administration says I have zero interest in serving in the president's cabinet\nOr there was nothing against the president right is that I like him I Want to help them I Want him to be successful but I think I can do more good for the country and how President Trump more effectively in the Senate my only plans that are run for my Senate seat and twenty twenty [noise] so that puts that speculation I think clearly to rest\nUm the second was I don't think she's going nowhere and that's what Tim rights he says hurricane Michael one thing that may support your theory about Nikki Haley is her answer about spending more time with their family and that was kind of like one of the you were gonna recap and I said no I think we we need to listen to a couple of these questions\nAnd when she was dusting out\nThat you know this is not personal it's just it was really in essence self imposed term limits it has been a very busy very historic very remarkable and successful two years\nAnd I think it's time to handed off to someone else ...\nSomebody in a follow up said so is this really about spending time with your family and she said no not at all my family supports me and whatever I Do\nIt\nBecause what would be would be disastrous for Nikki Haley to tell everybody I just want to spend time with my husband and my and my and my kids I had six very busy years as governor to very busy years as an ambassador just want to go home and focus on my family and then boom five months later you find out where she's going somewhere\nThat's clear\nSo that's why everyone's going to speculate today or the president had that meeting in in the White House so that people don't speculate things like see there goes another woman can't work with Trump or you know there was a woman maybe she's going to run against him I mean they they just managed and managed it well\nBut they did manage and she did manage to do all this prior to the mid term election and so I that's why my theory is crystal clear I think Penn State's going or Trump is going\nOn twenty twenty\nWhen I say Trump I think because Ebola all ready if there is no blue wave and he's got two more years\nLiquid his impact has been on the Supreme Court look what does impact has been on the dial liquid his impact has been on the GDP look who does impact has been on the trade deals and repatriated capital back in our country and jobs returning to our country we have more jobs in we have bodies wages increase\nForeign policy wise he has made America strong again and respected again that's remarkable\nAvoided a war with North Korea to come into the tables for talks Iran's imploding from within ISIS has decimated I mean you can make a case worker this president do and the and the other for years\nAnd if there is one negative it's and I don't think it's we're going to find out in the mid term election but the Democrats would have you believe Republicans say women\nWhich they don't just like\nTaylor Swift did not speak on behalf of all the tendencies values the Democrats don't speak on behalf of all women\n\nBut Nikki Haley and Donald Trump as a ticket would be pretty strong and twenty twenty to respond to that\n\nSomeone would executive experience as a governor and foreign policy chops as an ambassador not a bad person have a heartbeat away or if Trump's accomplished everything and decides I'm really the only obstacle now I made America great I'm not a politician\nI don't need another term America great again now get behind Mike and Nikki and keep it great I'm going back to business that's why am\nI I I literally believe it's one of the two\nAnd then there's Robert Redford [noise]\n[noise] I Would not based on an entire segment on Robert Redford he's not worth it is he a good director he's okay is he a great actor yes\n\nIs he somebody we should take our political cues from our world view cues from\nNo\nHe can't even figure out to be done acting but Robert Redford maybe done acting\nSoon but he's not done lecturing he issued a formal brief statement about big things as his son danced Institute website tonight for the first time I can remember\nNow while he'll never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh he'll never mentioned Donald Trump by starting with tonight and tonight being the night that Brett Kavanaugh is sworn in as a justice on the Supreme Court gives you your context\n\nIf he didn't mean for it to he suddenly needs to get better at writing and delivering which hasn't really been a weakness for him as a writer as a director or an actor so I think he's intentionally\nAll of this is\nFoundational to his motion will respond emotions and in response to Brett Kavanaugh so words have meanings and I'm not an idiot he's he does definitely delivering this after Brett Kavanaugh is officially sworn it\nTonight for the first time I can remember I feel out of place in the country I was born into and the citizenship I've loved\nMy whole life now I can think of a lot of moments in American history that would be a stain on your patriotism self esteem I don't think this nomination is it\nBut he does\nFor weeks I've watched with sadness as our civil servants have failed us turning towards bigotry mean spirited spiritedness and mockery as the new normal tools of the trade\n\nI Hope he's talking about both sides and then we'll be talking primarily about the left because that's has been the worst\nUnfortunately keeps writing so we'll get a ...
