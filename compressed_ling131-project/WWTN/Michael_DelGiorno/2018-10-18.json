point five billion dollars were spent on how well Halloween spending roughly seven billion dollars were spent\nSo we spend more on Halloween than we do electing a president and members of Congress\nAnd an end to thirty or Congress\nYeah everyone that says there's too much money in politics all I can point to a lot of things or we don't come close spending the amount of money we do\nWe spend more money on airline baggage fees than we do on electing members of Congress\nWell I'll tell you I don't get me started on airlines you brought it back up see I Know you were listening I Know

here's\nHere's my question again the coming at it from a nonpartisan perspective um you know all ask questions of those on the right those on the left but that story from the Washington Post for the Democrats have raised one billion dollars\nPeople the Democrats and people on the left do a lot of lecturing how money in politics is bad why would they go race a billion dollars to spend on election\nThat I found a leaps right off the page doesn't it\nThe hypocrisy of all the people who tell us there's too much money in politics we kind of broke down those Halloween numbers in fact the matter is we spent three times more money on Halloween in two thousand sixteen and we did on the liking of Congress and you wonder why we got what we got sitting up there\nAnd it was so much fun to me and talk with folks listen to this radio station so kind\nYou are so gracious\nAh and and uh it was just a wonderful evening or there's another event coming up uh at the home are coming up we're actually into a broadcaster that from the ... mid day or if I was really smart I can navigate this website do three of the things at the same time that one's coming up uh give me a date somebody give me that I have it for you to second I guess\nUh the ... the homes talked on the nine seven narratives get tickets there it is\nA give me some date super talked on tonight sevens going to start at noon\nOkay get rid of that and it's coming up\nA it's a ticketed events so you want to get in touch with us one PM Thursday November first there it is there's been a member first a super talk Ninety nine seven at the palm restaurants or you want to get on the website and get information and get yourself a ticket and be there obviously not everybody can get there this is a ticket that\nBut something's going to be very important in a broadcast about another broadcast event that's coming up election night yes Tuesday night election night join us and I gave you the\nClue earlier friends the clue for where are we going to be an election night was\nPizza crust for the cameras that can brother can\nYou ... years rather David you Googled pizza crust I Know you did you Google pizza crushed you were you were sniffing around trying to figure out what's the clue on pizza crust as to where we are going to be on election night yeah you see an election night special live radio audience from Nashville, Tennessee and across the world\nIs going to be at ...\nIn Franklin oh that I hear that's a nice place well it is a really nice places Michael does or not would teach me for my use of the adverb are really an adjective I don't really know I own as me catches me every time I use anyhow mafia's us as a great\nRestaurant we appreciate the ownership there and they are going to be where that's what that's where we'll be Franklin at the factory mafia says it's a big restaurant ah we've got the whole place so this is the night for everybody to show up it is a non ticketed event you want to spend election night with the best information the fastest information\nCome there and reason I say pizza crust is because\nIf there's anything about ... that works it's the pizza crust I Am a big fan of ... I was in Florida a couple of nights ago\nAnd working out of our Florida office working on the elections and all this going on down there and I want to tell you I went to a restaurant haven't been there before\nIn Orlando and I had pizza crust was so good I Want to cry it was so excellent I actually eat the crust and left the pizza was so good now you've got to be Italian to get into that because\nYou have to understand the flour and the water and do you bake it on the stone and how well is it done and how fluffy is it I'm a ... it's just and stuff that I like it's the stuff and I will tell you the story about ... here's a story in advance I already know the story because I talk to the owner and it's a good story\nThey went out shopping for a pizza crust recipe to start this restaurant odd years and years ago and they traveled the country and there's a tally and I appreciate this guy they traveled the country or to try to figure out who's got the best flower who's got the best\nAre all the pieces that come into a crush the it's important and the criteria was they wanted a pizza crust that was as good the next day is when you ate it in the restaurant\nNow that is a challenge I Will tell you if you come to mafia was on election night and if you order a large pizza and they're large beaches you will not regret taking get home because the next day when you warming up it is as good as if you were sitting there with the hot pizza right out of the other\nThey managed to do it so pizza crust is the story of mafia says there's a lot of great pizza places all of our national I loved them all I frequent them all or none of that actually there are some good ones I frequent them all\nBut this one's got crushed that is worth if you've never had it you got to try to then crossed it's excellent and it's just as good the next day so it's another reason to come on election night because\nTo our special radio event because whatever peach you take all of them just as good the next day so election coming up you watch that the palm and Christmas in America is coming up on the station live\nOn Christmas Eve and probably Christmas Day but also Thanksgiving night

that's going on [noise] we've talked about the money we talked about the polls\nI've got a hunch for you I've got a hunch for you that part of the reason that people want to keep this race close in the mindset here in Tennessee is because they're of the money is flowing\nSee if this race gets viewed either of these races the big races at the at the top of the tickets they widens just doesn't tend to see this is happening all over the country there's a vested interest in the consulting community\nTo keep the racist close because they want the money to flow no altruistic told him talking to you on a radio station radio stations make money on election time okay ... works there's moving parts and pieces newspapers online services Facebook makes a\nBoat load of money off of politics a boatload of\nRadio stations television stations cable companies ... satellite company they all make do in the election process so if the races are close more do flows from the donors and more do get

with negative political ads that is one of the reasons by the way that the consultants don't like the work of the roundtable or the public square me very much\nI don't like negative ads I think they're stupid and I think the insult your intelligence and if only gotten worse you know there was a time when negative ads were kind of like wow look at that oh they said that because it was different\nNow you'll notice as racist get closer and voting starts happening all you see are negative ads attack counterattack hack ... back and forth back and forth it's it is it's cruel and unusual punishment to the voter\nIt really is\nBecause common sense tells us I don't care where you vote who you vote for\nThe other person isn't that bad\nThey don't live in a black and white world they don't live in a a ... up on the edge of Armageddon everyday their breast does not kill puppies\nI they come on I ... it's an insult to all of our intelligence but this is the realm in which they live because negative ads are not about getting a a a candidate for a voter for candidate a to switch to\nBe it's to get to a voter to not vote\nThey are the greatest form of voter suppression in the

why\n\nNow let's talk about where this races going political ran an article that's very fascinating 'cause we are going to jump over to twenty twenty 'cause that's where this has gone with the ... this is an industry we we've you'll elections\nIs like okay we got to get through this it's like the one visit to the doctor I got to go towards the dancers\nAnd we go and I think that's over I have
