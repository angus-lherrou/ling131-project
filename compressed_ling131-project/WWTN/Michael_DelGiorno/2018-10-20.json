you do not feel like you've been made fun of or somebody made out like it was a stupid question\nBecause there's you know the seating air conditioning indoor air quality most people don't know much about it so we're going to assume that there are no stupid questions but if you call me and asked me a question that doesn't have to do with those things\nSince ...\nAnother segment of the efficient heating and cooling our\nUh this I'm your host Jeff ... with the fish and heating and cooling the number here to station that hopefully will do some good is six one five seven three seven Ninety nine eighty six were going to jump wholesome calls here and just second try some out and see if they work for us\nAnd um if they don't well then are you guys around a lot um will uh we'll see what we can do with it but let's start with Mike in St Louis burger again Mike are you there\nYeah can you hear me my can you hear me I can hear you if you can hear me I can hear you say there you go I was like we are taking care of fat guy with a solid working let me ask you I got two quick questions first one's a little\nBit maybe sarcastic but what big deal about indoor air quality unless you stay in the house\n[laughter] well that kind of is the big deal and and let let me uh let let me let me give actually um\nBecause I you know I'm like you I I don't spend a lot of time hanging out in the house and my children don't either they're outside playing and and and doing the things that really gives ought to be doing which is out there getting fresh air but\nEven even considering that in our homes now they're getting so tight used to homes are so loose and of course power and and let you know fuel and things were so cheap\nThat you really didn't notice it was you know people were heating would would or whatever or a you know the utilities weren't near as high as they are today but your homes were loose and so you got a lot of fresh air whereas now um because the homes are so tight you don't get near as much fresh air\nAnd and what has happened of course they don't really want to\nYou know the industry really doesn't want to talk about probably the cause of this but what has happened is it's become a an ... a place where it's easier for things like mold and stuff like that to to take root and become a problem\nBecause you're you're taking the same air conditioning and putting it back all the time and you're cutting down on the infiltration so much that you're not mixing a lot of fresh air with it [noise]\nUm so the only fresh or you're getting is is going in and out and of course it's obviously people are the people that are the most susceptible to this or the people that don't go outside much you know their yard is something that's just there for people to look at and they don't actually use it\nUm [noise] so but I mean but that's the truth of it and so as to deal with the indoor air quality um you know okay so you end up trying to deal with things like mold and and you know the\nSame way like it it just seemed to me like it's a feel good\nThing to put something in your house play my ears plane for some people a lot of games or feel good than it is a scientific will act in ... in India are stale\nAnd the idea that everybody needs it than I Would agree with you the idea that everybody needs and everybody has to have it we sell air cleaners and use the lights and steam humidifiers and stuff but we don't sell 'em to everybody\nUm we typically summed up people who are warned them as well as there's times where we recommend them if we think it's necessary and we think that it you know you got a situation where it's something that you need it most of the time it's people that have\nHealth issues are allergy issues you'd be surprised at the people who move from up north down south and then find that they have trouble with breathing pollen and different things like that because they've spent forty years up there that come down here in the body's not acclimated\nTo the environment and honestly on air cleaner in a situation like that does give them a little relief at home at least listening\nI gotta go outside to go to that they do whatever they they do it [noise] and there may not like\nThat's rather visually gonna have to get used to it but it you know a little relief at home may be a good thing\nSure one of the question the more of a serious one I guess I've got a fair thing passenger van that I've converted into a camper I tried a portable air conditioner where you live in and out the window and then anything above\nEighty degree it just did not do it unless you were to fade away from it what would you recommend or adequate air conditioning\nOr something like that or your power requirements or what's going to really be your issue but I think if you if you figured out a way to POWER UP a window air conditioner you should be able to [noise]\nTo get the power to A Douglas system and you can probably mount um condemn Israel under the sun or the back of that thing\nI've heard you say Douglas Douglas ...\nDouglas gets a little mini split\n'em and you know capacity what sounds like you just don't have enough capacity with that window unit so I even a like a motel unit probably wouldn't have the capacity you need either but you could do a duck lists and get your bracket or something amounted to the back of that van or to the side or depending on how you're using it I don't know how your\nYou know how much it's moving or whatever but you can get one mounted to the back it kind of looked funny but it's but it's possible to do it in and put a lot of rain on line that I just\nDidn't know you seem to be very um up to date on everything and I'm so glad I got through today the day I got through to you you couldn't hear me but I Am glad [laughter] I'll tell you now\n[laughter] I thought it was those trials and tribulations isn't it [laughter] well you\nAnd your callers have to but I'm so well thank you so much I appreciate your which at your information\nNo problem things mine are let's go to who's up next we'll see Ronnie ... around here either\nYes or\nAll right and you can hear me tell you that's a good thing what's going on\nHere I've got a house a shop in hundred the White House to wander down a focus on the house two hundred and forty one job where I'm at because of health or I'm not in this I bought a new ad up on you\nThat I was going to set up I'm looking for something in the job\nThat fully employed and I'm just not the job and they told me that that I I mean it was one over ... which I didn't really hear on that I'm just looking at not sure but they said because of the Thirteen hundred feet a power\nBut I wouldn't want that burning my mother up as a ... vote ... both drop yesterday and so my question was is the west than like\nA ... I got one of the five and ... is that with a pool that's old am I run into a problem with the ...\nActually no um yes and no the the Douglas system well here's here's the thing it's not going to\nThe the Douglas system is going to use less energy just typically depending on which when you get because they're more efficient than a traditional five ten system\nThey do handle the lower voted you better though um you know they're they're not um there there there are Achilles' heel is is having voltage too hah really so\nUm it's going to handle it you don't know what his drop into do you\nKnow you're OK and probably won't until you put it under a load and actually start running something but I have a feeling that it's not going to drop quite as much as they're making out like it's going to\nEnd if you have an old five to an system you know obviously you could put it in there and to see what happened but if you just wanted to go with something more permanent you went with a duck list system they run better they typically are like um you know up to thirty vote is kind of what they're what they're shooting for\nUm you know down in the teens and even in the twenties on their voting she doesn't seem to affect them for near as much\nUm you know obviously a traditional system uh with low voltage we've seen that were you install a regular single face a residential air conditioner on commercial unit I've been out where somebody did that\nAnd you know the commercial building is running it like a a two oh wait two thirty three phase which typically pull the the standard voltage there's about two eleven or to twelve is what it typically has\nUm and that those compressors do wear out quicker because of the voting slower\nUm but but they don't die in a year or anything you know there are there for their their their for some time before they fail so um I don't think it's quite as catastrophic probably as soon as it's being made out but the Douglas system would definitely be a good answer for that\nAnd the multi that I get the head that what they call it the same with with that guy like they were as one\nYeah I just they're just basically air handlers and you can definitely do that you can do a multi zone system um you know do one condense or with a couple of different air handlers or something in different spices you know you've got ...\nEighteen hundreds or why and how many they teach you that what I'm looking for\nSome of that it's going to depend on how well insulated I mean really you would have to look at it so you but if you just look in the north and south of its um and it's even remotely well insulated you know you're probably going to need you know at least around three ton of cooling to really start to to do much with Eighteen hundreds were say [noise]\nUm and I don't know why are all part of it right again yeah her name brand new\nA been in my house for about twenty six years had a ... humid ... probably three or four years ago and I'm a notice it you know I Know it said something wallet do about it might not be the year it might be your house you know this girl and the problem right um\nBut it you know when it gets really hot outside if I were to get it at all about Seventy two when I get home but probably\nSeventy five on the ... that mistakes and it's it's constantly running and I also noticed that uh when I was outside Bob a while the fans don't know how\nThe gross like I should say that up the code I er it felt like it was a lot of there's a lot like it might be I got some work that's come on done\nAnd or maybe you know I like it I've got some hold it up for it and not just they replaced that\nSure yeah and you and any of those things may be so um you know obviously the first my first question for you though is has always been this way you know for Twenty years you know okay\nNo I don't I don't think it's always been the wife of two tone unit lemon water bottle eleven or what but I also hope I get always been that way\nOkay well if you're pretty sure it hasn't always been that way then obviously something has changed and more that are likely it's not that you put this new unity in and it can't keep up on the old one day and that's just the Rodney not gay so\nUm if you're feeling a lot of cold air now obviously sometimes when it's really hot outside that cross places are just naturally feels cool because it's all ... cooler so that that may be the issue there but you're either going to have somebody or you're going to have to go into their yourself or just crawl through there and take a look at it like duck work\nYou know we see a lotta duct work where\nYou know they put the branch lawns and they rented all hard pie they dove tail end of the branch lines stuck him off into the pipe and there's little gaps all the way around that tap where it goes in and everybody line on the on the system will have that so you got nine or ten places on the unit that airs leaking out every time it comes home\nAnd you know going through\nSalem everything up chicken it out and making sure it's working right\nAs a great place to start you're just making sure that Duckworth ...

unfortunately this nine you're bull market has encouraged some Americans to claim Social Security early and then they turn around and invest the money but\nThe thing is this could be a huge mistake

head over to investing sense dot com take advantage of this free offer\nRight now we have Thomas calling from Alabama at eight eight eight eight three three eight six three seven that he's retired and ask a question about required minimum distribution so Thomas what is your question\nYes uh I wanted to know things about our ages I currently have a traditional a or a an a or a roll over and also have a ...\nAnd the question was when you start cooking or indeed which I Will be doing next year uh I Know you have the total up the balance of the IRA but is the wrong a or a included in that balance\nThat you take a year or in the bomb\nYeah great question with a great question so when you calculate the R. M. D. amount what you're going to do is that you're going to add up all of your pre tax accounts\nYour traditional i._r._a. your role over IRA your four O. one K. if you're not working or are you still working right now are you actively contributing to an employer plan\nOr I Am not working part time only but I'm not contributing to unemployed on\nOkay so if you were working you would be able to exclude that current four one K.\nBut you're going to add up all your pre tax accounts traditional i._r._a. roll over four one K. you are not going to add the Ross IRA value in your calculation\nUm and also what you basically have the pre tax you're going to exclude the Ross um and then this is actually when we're building um when we're building income plans for people we look at different and distinct ah categories of investments the pre tax the raw or the brokerage account any savings\nAnd so as we're trying to figure out how to you know get people that paycheck that retirement pay check the the money will come from different places\nNow have you ever thought about so you've got this Ross and you've got the pre tax accounts have you ever gone through any sort of Ross conversion calculation have you ever considered anything along those lines\nWere not on a heck of a consider that I've done on the ... about three or four years ago I'm I'm going to be doing another one because this is my last here now so I'll be seven and a half next year I'm going to a second raw conversion from a traditional our right\nThat the issue that kind of um the sidelines a lot of people is that so what what happens with these Ross conversions is you have these pre tax amounts you effectively take a distribution\nI. E. earned income for whatever you want to move from the pre tax Ira over to the Ross so a lot of different factors um you know kind of old way on the viability of this move but your taxes are now\nAnd what they're going to be leader your overall financial situation but the thing that trips up a lot of people as their ability or inability to pay taxes on the distribution with outside of the IRA money\nSo as long as you have the ability to pay that tax burden with outside the IRA money and as long as you've gone through the calculations you should be fine\nOkay great great awesome well Thomas thanks for calling the show and a really have a great week thank you very much\nNow it's time for this week's portfolio review and this is where Andy dives deeply into a portfolio that's been sent to us\nAnd this week Andy's review has a Social Security twist to it and that's perfect because we're trying to help Americans today with a limited free offer for a portfolio review that includes of Social Security analysis\nNow a reminder make sure you consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor by going to investing sense dot com\nSo now this week's review Larry said as his portfolio and he writes ... if you plan to take Social Security and you have a sizable four one K. does the draw from the four one K. impact Social Security payments\nSuppose I make Fifteen thousand dollars part-time draw Social Security and pull sixty thousand dollars how will that sixty thousand dollars impact Social Security\nHey great question Larry let me tell you that Larry's got pretty cool story we went back and forth over email the first thing that I asked Larry was when is all of this going to come together you've got\nHis reply to yeah he said I plan to retire in the next eight to Nineteen mountains I'm sixty one I'll be sixty two in January and I want to work part time next year I have about one point four million in a four one K. and three hundred thousand in cash\nI Know if I go over a certain kept while on Social Security I'm I'm not going to get the full benefit\nRight so the rule that Larry is referencing only applies when you reach full retirement age and that's when your earnings no longer reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn now\nIf you're younger then full retirement age and you make more than the annual earnings limit your earnings may actually reduce your benefit so it's based on this for retirement age right for Americans born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age is sixty six\nA beginning with you guys born in Nineteen fifty five two months or added for every ... year until the full retirement age reaches sixty seven for Americans born in Nineteen sixty year later so what\nAre the ... to the benefits in case you reached the earnings limit\nIf you're under full retirement age for the whole year Social Security ... a dollar from your benefits for every two dollars that you earn above the annual limit and for twenty Eighteen that limit is Seventeen thousand forty dollars\nNow if you can imagine it gets a little bit more complex in the year you reach full retirement age Social Security deduct a dollar and benefits for every three dollars that you earn above the limit for twenty Eighteen that limit is forty five thousand three hundred sixty dollars but they only count earnings before the month that you reach\nFull retirement age she's got all that no yeah no my head spinning I was trying to keep track I was I didn't have the right it don't even know what the first sentence I was okay and then try to keep track of limits in age is just it's unbelievable\nYeah Social Security is just ridiculously complex the worst part is all these rules\nAnd that's when more baby boomers will start claiming benefits but please do not freak out that this is you know just a couple of years away and it's because the Social Security administration says that interest income alone from the trust fund should bridge the gap until twenty thirty for\nOne of the big reasons were running a limited time offer on investing sense dot com right now is because that some Americans are using a risky Social Security claiming strategy before full retirement age and investing in the stock market\nRight and listen I Will never bust your chops for investing in the stock market because we invest in the market\nBut not like this man what these guys are doing is they're for going these guaranteed increases because you know you just couldn't wait a little bit longer for your Social Security so then you're basically faced with this double risk last potential\nFor that guaranteed increase and you're investing on your own you've got the risk inherent in those investments we managed clients risk all week long knowing this happens is so worrisome to me so\nWhen it comes to solving this problem how do you do that for your clients and how does this free portfolio review help\nBecause we've had this amazing nine you're bull market you've got four one K. balances you got irate balances their way up and a lot of you see this and you think that you're a hundred percent ready for retirement that's great but you have to realize your goal now becomes to try to protect and to try to preserve what she got\nAnd that takes a completely different mindset it takes a different approach to what you used to do with your long term money that ball Attila the alone should've exposed why their Social Security claiming strategy is just crazy\nBut at the more individual level it really depends on your unique situation everybody is a little bit different\nSo we solve for those differences for those of you know specific issues by getting to know ya and by and by providing you with three very important items as a part of this portfolio review\nWe sit down with you it's an in person review of your current investments by our local financial engines team

[noise]\nGod Bless the people to strange organ but anyway so um we've been talking about you know you're doing the concrete so now what before getting the story what is the typical if you're doing an overlay right and it all depends on the different substrate that you go you're going over on what you're trying to accomplish\nWhen you say they will crack if the concrete below cracks\nIs on a crack I mean just like if you were to put a piece of paper on something and it breaks is going to break up um we're not talking about a two inch thick or a foreign sticks lab mhm sometimes it just needs to be removed and replaced\nIt's like a top of shame to cap that doesn't have a gym to cap they put that lot white create on it OK operate on it and overtime or gets in there and it breaks start cracking our phone ... yeah and people go and try to paint what'd you can do that but that's a bad day don't cut off farm it's going to get you a little bit you know maybe it's a year two years\nBut we do metal ... concrete and you're sitting in a real new Congress and we put a metal cap on it and to hear it from the sides not the top people from the sides\nMakes a difference the big difference [laughter] that's why we're plays a lot of them 'cause they're all leaking from males that goes straight down the ... on the three years later\nIt uncovered under that extended warranty right do they pay the extra for that they paid extra for us and I like it now as you get to Google dot com and this is good it's good guy and I'm like I just I really want to hear about concrete and we used to always tell people when I was doing driveways and\nEverything else people would ask guidelines but that was that ... the kick of it is is that that goes he's little crack like yeah I promise you one thing about concrete it will correct mhm\nWe try to determine where we make it crack at ... ... and other things on New Years is a different basis is a little different they get that but that's what you did the setting people's expectations\nThat's the hardest part yes yup always yes um people think oh it's concrete you can't hurt it ... no you can still hurt it you know\nAnd I heard it when they sprayed off leaving open expose aggregate and you just took ten years off your driveway looks pretty but seniors are gone national is\nMuch the I mean we have more exposed aggregate than any other city in ...\nAnd states masquerading river but you've got a maintenance it you've got to keep it sealed yeah you gotta get inspected well I think it's good but once a year ago last year it would depend on what product that you do write you need to have it takes maintenance I guess the one that I'm involved\nYeah yeah um so yeah you got to keep you gotta anytime you have something done to something you have to keep it up you know every time you get something you'd give up something you can't just half [laughter] that's not the way it works um and so but let's see what we're talking\nAbout when I was going back to his overlay in in the ... and then\nWhat you know the thing is that in my mind on concrete and I'm a big thick concrete and you know so I'm used to industrial concrete if you will want not what stops it from cracking but what kind of a life expectancy can you have an does it require maintenance again going back and foot ... that's been on top the coating is where the protection\nComes in um depending on what kind of code and you put down depends on how well Santa where your shoes your feet are two hundred six hundred ... saying paper mhm okay so if I were a power cowboy boots somewhere down faster if I'm On the fuck person is on take a lot longer\nUm you've got outside you've got more elements of guts salt and you've got to go\nAhead or lesions you foresee a solid for expansion contraction famous roofing cheats yeah they only get to write a summer and they're built on sand anyhow so that's a whole another story [laughter] it's great to visit

down that way unless I'm On a why am I not there anyways show yeah we'll ever so but yeah it's depending on the cutting edge put down you can't put an epoxy outside because of a lot more oyster and stuff like that and let's get a dry will laws try and you could have flies and bugs and leaves and everything gets stuck in it\nSo we use a an acrylic base and I just think he's still not water base
