did we went through this every day maybe every other day he starts slow you know what I'm saying and all the other day\nWhat would what I'm thinking is is the swamp is serious business right I mean we were intended to be a government up foreign by the people are with was senators the guarded our state's rights with uh the people's house to house of representatives based on population that represents us\nAh and defend us an executive branch to execute the laws of the people by way of the people's house and then they know it's it's more it's all these things have morphed into things they shouldn't be\nUh the Senate has become a club or one hundred that look after national interest\nUh but then you have a Supreme Court to make sure nobody over steps the bounds of the constitution I mean that was the checks and balances now we have a government and really quite frankly even more importantly Oregon we're seeing this in this election like previous elections\nThere are individuals out there that believe everything wrong in life should be solved by government and whoever screams the loudest should get what they're asking for\nMe it makes you gotta understand something and I and I didn't have the government now I'm not I'm not I'm not\nI'm not kidding ... the the the the book that we're talking about this children's book\nI thought if you could boil it down what we're talking about into a fable that kids can understand you got to make it simple because it is simple and here's the way it works let's be honest if the people can't govern themselves\nYou need big government and since the beginning of time we've had big government you get the government in the form of a huge bureaucracy you can have big government in the form of a king that tells you what to do that's the way the human race has run since the beginning of time until\nSeventeen Seventy six God allowed something that happened that had never been done in the history of the world we have forgotten that what we have is an insane idea that shouldn't work\nBut for the grace of God eight people would govern themselves and this is something I mean I talked about it in Fresno I talk about it wherever I go\n... the reason I wrote my book if you can keep it was when I really began to understand this I thought\nMy whole life I've really not understood this and most of my fellow Americans don't understand that we're not teaching it in the schools and if you have in America\nThat doesn't understand what America is supposed to be America as we know it goes away self government goes away and the swamp grows and grows that's what happened it's like if you don't weed the garden you know if they can keep it if I could keep a garden if you only in the garden what happens\nIn how how did we lose that will be turned away from God so we were placed absolute truth with moral relativism which says there is no absolute truth which of course is an absolute\nA spiritual pluralism belief in God and he got no God ... relativism whatever you think is right in your mind and so faith in God and virtue and self governance and self control and personal responsibility and I guess work ethic\nAnd all that stuff and all that I don't mind the breakdown of the family this creates a need and independence if there's not a father there to provide that are men provide if there is not exactly\nRight yeah well I I just thought it was I mean do you you should have a radio show because you don't understand that stuff\n[laughter] better than I Do like I Do you get this do not mocked me then I got out I Want to tell you let me ... early you yeah [laughter]\nOh can I tell you something not only did not learn at the Yale [laughter] [laughter]\nWhat I knew about this was taught at Yale I'm the biggest\nEnemy I think that if you have any of these schools Yale University the top of the list they are the enemies of freedom they have become global list\nA preacher's of globalism and socialism and of course they think they're doing good they think that they're on the right side of things but you know and I know that there are sadly mistaken and they have strayed far there from their roots that America is rape and there was\nA little more than ... ... attacks us is joining a best selling author his new book is Donald drain the swamp and I understand why you used a fable or a childhood approach or an analogy by the way Jesus did those very effectively\nUm but seriously to swamp the term swamp and everybody's Rosen around now does it do justice to just how far we're missing it and how dangerous this is\nWell look let's let's let's look at it this way let me tell you what ... let me let me tell the fable so that the audience is tracking and then we can go back and explain it I'll tell it as quickly as I can there's a ... the way I we've set it up okay it's a children's book and it's funny it's most be funny for adults but kids\nKids obviously ... if they mainly a kid but the idea is that there's a people\nIf people okay they're all ... people and their king has moved to the middle of a swamp he lives in a in a in a white castle in the middle of the swamp and they can't get to him they can't communicate with him he is out of touch with the people he governs right\nThe swamp people who live in a swamp they're the only ones that he talks to right so the people are upset they say what are we gonna do we gotta talk to our king is out of touch with us he's out of touch with with what we care about how do we get to him so they go to the\nCape fellow caveman who was kind of famous he's a builder of caves uh everybody wants to Cape built by Donald they taught that Donald Donald you know how to make stuff happened how can we do with how can we talk to the game he says you know what I can sometime tomorrow I'll take a walk through the swamp we'll see what happens so he goes down to the swamp\nAnd the first one ... are you ready it's\nLobbyists or us George stores no no no a lobbyists or at home a little bit smaller and smaller\nDinosaurs a lobbyist source and a lobbyist explains them listen pal ... the king doesn't talk to anybody lives outside the swamp we don't like people live outside the swamp so forget about it so he goes back to the Cape people and he says we got a problem we're going to have to drain the swamp\nRight and the people said what are you crazy you can't bring this one because it's simple I'm a builder we do this kind of all the time or you got to do is they dig a trench we're going to do the biggest\nBest trench you have ever seen and Mexico is going to pay for the ... just getting right so we're going to touch so that people say you can't do that that keeps you going to get the swamp critters angry and he says what you've been angry for awhile haven't you may maybe if they are and so he goes back to the next day with a shovel Donald and he starts to dig any seats at the green color of the swamp is actually\nMoney the whole swamp is made up money finally figured out why the swamp creatures won't let leave there why to king won't leave and he owns ...\nSo he says I've now I've got a really big so he starts to take the swamp creatures get angry at him one of the swamp creatures looks suspiciously like crank Chuck Schumer but it's a bipartisan swamp turtle so finally they say you're going to get it now here comes the biggest bad a swamp creature of them all\nAnd ladies and gentlemen it's the George Soros\nThe Georgia sources a Hungarian billionaire diners I Can't go into it but the Georgia source companies really scary they say now you made the door to source mad and then Donald here's behind him a rousing voices not as mad as he made us and he turns around all the gay people showed up with\nShovels and they help him to dig the money starts to flow to the horizon and of course everybody in the swamp ... swamp creatures chase the money to the rise and never to be seen again the swamp drained including the king of the Georgia source\nSo everything's great except the king has gone so what do they do now it's a little girl says well maybe Donald would be our kings they ask him Donald is you'd be our king and he looks at them he says\nYou are a free people now you don't want a king a king tells people what to do and they have to do it but a free people tell their leaders what to do and the leaders have to do it and they say oh you mean like like a president and he says well yeah and if that's what you're looking for\nUm your caveman so he becomes the first president and everybody lives happily ever after now he does some remodeling but he keeps it under budget and ah and that's the fable but it's like suddenly you realize\nTrump said we're going to get our government pack thinking about this concept we didn't even know that we lost it the swamp is what happens when you lose control of your government money to impress\nBegan to create their own kingdom and it has nothing to do with you or me which is totally antithetical you might as well have King George the third or you might as well have the people in Brussels you know running things\nThat is the antithesis of what it means to be an American and as far as I'm concerned every now again in our history we have an existential crisis we had in Seventeen Seventy six where you were revolted against the this tyrant King George the third we had an an Eighteen sixty\nAnd I think honestly we're having it again it's like another civil war we're facing forces of globalism money interests interested do not care about\nAmerican liberty and may I ask a question and the one on your show the one question that we never discussed that is really the center question what is the proper size and role of government\nAt all as possible and I'm not even kidding\nNo I don't know what is the role and responsibility of the cells govern\nThat's really the ... not slavery now that's the root of this and for the for the Democratic party\nThey they have the different world view that view of what the role of government is and it's something America left right and in the middle is going to have to answer I also want to get your impression on this

Harris grandstanding it was about twenty twenty for them if they were interested in and keeping the house and Senate and two thousand Eighteen\nA boy they would have acted a lot differently during the hearing said or their ignorance adds to the result of their actions or they intentionally uh you know are just focused on their own self interest in twenty twenty\nDaily Macedonia is joining us a earns you spokesperson on the midterm elections um I think if we dissected and and and there's a lot of opinion\nHow to Donald Trump become president well there was a real outsider movement and what did the DNC do metal metal in its own primary process rigging was super delegates ... with the with the the the narratives are cable networks\nAnd Bernie Sanders would have been the natural choice but they rigged so Hillary so you had the ultimate outsider and Donald Trump against the ultimate establishment candidate and Hillary Clinton and then to boot eighty percent thought she was a lie or a non trustworthy so we had a bad candidates the wrong candidate of the wrong time\nTwo weeks out I notice the foggy weather condition and we're getting closer and closer to the runway\nI I think we would all agreed to Kavanaugh stun they're going to look back and say it costs\nNo doubt and also the caravan either blatant disregard for border or their calls for abolition of ice at that point it backfire\nAs well but definitely put your finger on the right turning point which would cap and all that when\nWe saw that enthusiasm gap you mentioned narrow down to single digits Democrats once had a double digit advantage and we're an enthusiast and that changed\nAnd Kavanaugh was the point at which voters and the Republican Party realized we cannot afford to let Democrats take back the house that struck that means resistant means impeach cabin on means impeach President Trump even though all of that faith that it what it means I think our voters woke up and realize that and that's where the caravan marching toward our southern border seven thousand strong\nI think Republican voters are getting even more energized the Democrats are just\nReally making a fool of themselves with all of their Kavanaugh activity and now they're they're care of and um you know talk to and their blatant ignoring of what is happening down south\nIsn't it becoming is crystal clear and I really think you know we went through a year's a bronco bomb and that was everybody pitted against everybody that was divide and conquer so it was men against women women against men gays again straight streets against gay I can do all this for you but to summarize it was identity politics and it's just not working but they really lack\nIs a plan and an ideology and so what is really to me it looks like is\nThe country's going in a clear direction we really want to halt that direction and go back to those old days I just don't see that being a huge push and quite frankly I think there's great portions within the Democratic party they can't believe what their party's becoming and who their faces had become and what their messages have become including\nHarassing people in restaurants and provoking violence uh that I just none of that points to it if I was a Democrat it's hard for me to understand and put myself in their shoes\nWhat would there be to be enthusiastic about this delusion that Donald Trump is Hitler and we got to stop 'em I mean that's all they really got\nThat their idea is motivated by in a complete and total animated and hatred for this president it's quite remarkable it had nothing to do with the idea that nothing to do it proactive policies they have so much disdain\nFor this president I and that is their sole motivating fourth and you look at some of the stunts that come out of the Democratic party like the DNA tests like ... like saying Eric Holder thing kick Republicans are Hillary thing don't be settled or Republicans\nAnd you ask you know how does this help here twenty Eighteen prospects law doesn't\nSay why are you doing it Democrats well the answer is quite clear that such disdain for this president that they are blindly I throwing that out there blindly to get it blindly throwing out the you know called for violence and it's all driven by a negative disdain for the president that's the sole motivation\nIdentical and I am one gratuitous questions just for me 'cause I Want to pick your brain\nI noticed in that whole debacle was Kavanaugh Bernie laid pretty low and I think Kamala Harris laid relatively low compared to Cory Booker who cook disclosed compared to others who ruin their chances to even get reelected uh any question in your mind the Kamala Harris\nIs their girls and twenty twenty\nI mean I I definitely think he's running there's no doubt whether Democrats to her it's hard to say because he had the left there are you know let me say there are moderate Democrats in the Democratic party who voted for President Trump we love these guys thanks for coming over I'm voting for us\nBut in the left wing rules the party and it's hard to say the ... that craves the left wing that's committing violence and mom like behavior it's hard to say who they they ... and attack coordinate because they they roll today the Democratic party as you said ... could have been the nominee but at the at the DNC their core nations they don't have election so\nVery difficult to see who the far left mob we'll coordinate this time\nAround my hair is I don't I don't I don't think you know geography is one thing I I don't I don't think it's it should go unnoticed that her and Bernie or an Iowa I'll just say\nOh for sure they both had presidential ambitions that both laying the groundwork simply no doubt about
