sweat next testimony Julie sweat neck would have been a junior in college attending parties with Fifteen and sixteen year old boys [noise]\n\nI don't think there's anybody that finds that reasonable\nThat's number one by her timeline number two ah Julie sweat Nick is clearly\nA\nPortraying herself is someone that knew even though she's in college and a junior you know go into these sophomore highschool parties even though she knows the spike the punch with drugs and grain alcohol and then line up for gang rapes she continues to go to these parties\n\nThat doesn't seem logical to people including for a year and a half after she claims she was assaulted\nAlright so Julie sweat Nick is already a disgraced ridiculous latest accuser now we find out she face misconduct allegations that are Portland Company and by the way so much of the um\nThe defense of Michael ... and this is really a defense for Brett Kavanaugh it's funny how the goose and the gander never meet so he's saying oh these were ridiculous allegations they were unfounded timelines were all there were no witnesses you mean everything Brett Kavanaugh has been up against\nBut certainly I live on to a bit on that or what we do have is Rachel Mitchell although she was portrayed rather ... by Saturday Night live a she has issued a I should get the total\nIt's over twelve pages but it's the analysis of Dr Christine Blasey Ford's allegations um\nThrew out this and and it's nothing you didn't sense if you watch and apparently a lot of people watch we have the ratings a little bit later on\nIn legal context here's your bottom line is a classic he said she said case\nIncredibly difficult to prove that this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses not only could not corroborate her story they refuted her allegations\n\nFor the reasons disgust below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on evidence before the committee\nNor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard Dr Ford is not offered it consistent account of when they rape the assault happened\nUh and she outlines all the great inconsistencies that came up in her rush five minutes here and there Dr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name do name was given to the marriage therapists nor NATO name was in the marriage therapists notes\nNO NAME was given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes Dr Ford's husband claims to recall shaved and if a judge Cabot judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve at that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press as a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney had won the election\nIn any event it took Dr Ford over Thirty years to name her assailant\nThat's very suspicious to ms Mitchell\nWent speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific Dr Ford testified that she told her husband about the sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she informed her husband that she was the victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage and I really think this would fall\nWell\nDid it happen at all it didn't happen at all but even if it did happen\nUm\nIt goes back and forth between physical abuse and sexual assault and the media certainly taken it all the way to write\nShe testified that both times she was referring to the same incident or she has no memory of key details on the night in question that came up with the whole who was at the party where were they talking or are they laughing where they bouncing off the walls those continue to change\nShe doesn't remember in White House the assault allegedly took place let alone what year what month what neighborhood\nProbably most significantly how she got there how she got home and probably the most damning thing as everyone she identified as having attended including her lifelong friend\nRefute her account\n\nUm\nDr Ford is not offered it consistent account of the alleged assault according to her a letter to Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh a judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to the other party over his downstairs while she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault\nBut according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone that's probably why you remember that big line of questioning\nIn her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairs at which point other persons in the house we're talking to them\nShe testified the judge Kavanaugh and mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that people downstairs could not ... testified that after the incident she ran into the ... into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain she could not hear their conversations with others\nWhen they got downstairs instead she testified she assumed a conversation took place\nOr account of who was at the party has been inconsistent Dr ... struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations and her testimony regarding recent events or raises further questions about her memory\nOr this goes to Dr Ford couldn't remember if she showed a full or partial set of therapy notes to the Washington Post reporter she doesn't remember she actually had a copy of the notes when she texted the Washington Post\nShe refused to provide any ever therapy notes to the committee Dr Ford's explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions from the people on the beach to\nThe state representatives office later to the Senate office\nCould remember she had been a if she was being audio or videotapes when she took the polygraph she could remember\nA who chose the person who did the polygraph and nor could she said who paid for it uh this is all very recent history doctor ports description of the physical impact of the event raises questions this section of Rachel\nPhil's report I think I'll read verbatim because you'll find the most interesting even though I Am blessed and admitted she maintains that she suffers from anxiety claustrophobia and post traumatic stress disorder\nThat's ... that's the damages of this

better life\nAnd start packing\nHenderson bail Nashville\nStudio where dogs I mean I [noise]\nI'm getting Weaver with your top stories we've got the forecast for you\nComing up here in five minutes and the Supreme Court will not hear a challenge to tendencies abortion mall amendment one to Tennessee and says the nation's highest court decision today puts an end to the near four year old fight eight voters wanted to recount of the election were fifty three percent of voters approved amendment one\nIt has language that says abortion is not a write in Tennessee and the sex crimes prosecutor who was on Capitol Hill to question Christine Blasey Ford about her assault allegations that she would not bring criminal charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as making headlines\nIn the Democratic party at the DNC on the left social media left Hollywood left\nLiberal media left nobody will pay any attention to representative Keith Ellison and a lot of the hard facts\nI mean it is a much greater stretched to believe the judge Kavanaugh pin this girl and made her claustrophobic a thirty six years ago and it is not a hard stretch because while everyone refuse Christine forward story the person pictures documented going to the police sons account\nAll points Alison did it and yet Brazil fences borrows silence on ... and that's for sure I Wonder if somebody should rush into her if we support Keith Ellison for attorney general general in Minnesota are we is there a special place in hell for us\nAnd there should be in certain way or the woman that she originally scorn ion ...\nYou're Hirsi Ali on is known she's a Somali and former Muslim who work very hard now\nTo promote a and to expose the a dangerous an antiquated barbaric things that are happening to Muslim women are all under Islam and she talks about you know the female genital mutilation so I guess my question to zero fat would also be\nUm how do you despise the woman that is um you know talking about protecting young women and young girls um you know so you see the double standard there she is going after someone they despise or they talk about her a lot\nOf because she left Islam oh but you know that discounts all the good work that she's doing to protect\nMuslim girls and women so it really is and I think the thing that really ticks me off the most is that we're seeing this ... this movement by women who all of a sudden or think they are protected class\nUm who believe that they are above reproach and they don't lie and you know I personally we talked about it last week in between my disconnects um that I can tell you that women do live they do use the criminal justice system\nUm you know to have meant falsely accused and arrested so\nYou know this whole thing with her is truly a double standard in you know the last time we talked about her or\nIs that she received an award from the number one Muslim Brotherhood organization in this country the Islamic society of North America for her work an interface\nWell you know interface obviously is the proselytizing of Islam but it's also with her\nI'm associating how Islam is just like every other religion you know that's very um deer and close to Christianity and Judaism so you know the the ... are seeing the double standard or is and then for her to turn around and say that all women that don't do this to have her views belong in hell\nI'm you know I think the the uh Tennessee I'm the business and professional women attacked the\nAnd the Tennessee women a hall of fame which he was inducted into an October twenty Fifteen\nIs this what they stand for is this what they would support or one of their um members one of their board members one of their inductive do they believe that she should be a proud to be saying something like this I think it's disgusting\nAll right let's turn our attention to a Muslim guy with the act of explosives this was in West LA\nOh my God yeah and you know what it didn't make any national news that I watched it didn't make any news anywhere\nOther than a briefing on the ... uh you know out in LA but here we had a forty seven year old Muslim ... Ali who was pulled over by LA place an upon searching his car which she allow them to do they found two bombs the an improvised explosive devices\nThat were covered and shrapnel or in the back of his Toyota Corolla so um\nYou know this guy was headed somewhere to do damage they were active I ETs and obviously he was going somewhere to detonate these bombs uh which you know with with I mean what is your understanding on the side\nWas there anything going on in Los Angeles that that could have been a target\nYou know you know what I don't know I mean there are all three of them are a lot of\nTime marches late yeah\nYeah but I I haven't seen that yet\nBut I think it's it's just disturbing that nobody's talking about it you know I mean it's um I think if it would have been a member of a white Christian organization I think that we're seeing the tide being turned here but I'm certainly it it just went unchecked and this guy was was going to blow people up\nYou know we have another chance dog did you watch much of the hearing with Christine forward and Brett Kavanaugh\nI did absolutely\n... we're looking you know certainly live of course has its cultural impact I mean and they did a very very funny opening skit with Matt Damon is Brett Kavanaugh they really touched on\nAll the moments and the this is how they reshape this is how they reframe a so there is a you know hearing reality and then there is a cultural reality and I think at some point Brett Kavanaugh is quickly becoming a cocktail joke but if you look at this\nFrom from a non humorous standpoint you have a very discredited witnessing and Dr Ford um apparently her one big\nTake away from this is claustrophobia and fear of flying um there was a great deal of testimony given to along with other things that have contributed\nTo that which was a dead give away we have the final findings of Rachel Mitchell who is now been made into a comedy act on Saturday Night live but her conclusion was it's a classic you said she said but really not\nIt's even weaker than now Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and all of those witnesses not only do not corroborate her story they refuted her allegations to really use it but he said she said\nAh no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committed talked about the inconsistencies fear of flying across or phobia but she flies to scuba dive she flies\nOr to visit family members actually flies quite frequently she can't tell how she got to that house or how she got home she has different stories with her therapist with her husband different stories about what you did in the bathroom and what you heard didn't hear it was all very technically discredited and I know a lot of people are going to look at the tactic\nOf using Rachel Mitchell because the Democrats would have definitely if if if senators have been passionate and they're questioning those would have all been used in ads in the mid term election showing Republicans attacking a woman\nSo it was brilliant what they did but oh by the way what Rachel Mitchell exposed and her conclusions are also very relevant as the FBI begins their investigation and apparently they've already sat down with Deborah Ramirez there is no word about sitting down with Dr\nFord because I don't think there's any more to get from her I don't think anybody wants her to sit down with\nWas sweating big ah her stories of towns that have the spaghetti a calendar so what do you make of all of this um you know watching you know these kinds of memorable things like the OJ trial they tend to shape the public opinion\nOf of our leadership process and um\nI mean I think the cultural ramifications of always outweighed the confirmation ramifications and and we're no further in fact we're probably about five steps behind them\nI I just took away from it that it it's it's sad that we have this type of process that's been mutilated um you know when he said search and destroy rather than advise and consent I think he hit the nail on the head\nI think it's disgusting how they they mock how angry he was well you know if we're if we're going to start accusing people and we don't need a system\nTo provide evidence and prove that this happened we're in trouble you're in trouble you're white guy you know your son is in trouble down the road and and and this is\nThis is something that we can't do and I and I have seen this is so consistent among women who abuse the system and you don't want to name an abuser on these women are abusing the system that we have in place and then to boot there\nThere are also abusing this process that we have to nominate a Supreme Court judge I think it's disgusting but one thing that\nI did see that has been all over social media but some people don't seem to be talking about it and I could send this to you if you'd like\nA it was on Twitter and someone saw it and it's a video and I've seen it a hundred times\nOf congressman Barbara Jackson leave from Texas as it approaches her lawyer the male lawyer hands him a ... but she quickly puts in his pocket she looks around and make sure nobody's looking handsome this under sort of way down by the table what was that\nAbout I mean you know is this a payment for something I mean I I think it's fairly serious and certainly have passed it on to enough people hoping somebody looks at this because the whole thing has been dirty from the very beginning a and it will be continued you know it's going to continue to be dirty\nBecause they're not going to be happy with the FBI investigation it's gonna be the exact same outcome as they\nFound out in court the other day or the hearing the other day so where does this and how does it end I I don't think it ends well for anyone I think that one because he can't it\nAnd this is my set up to my question to you if if we're gonna have weaponized allegations without a shred of evidence without any witnesses to corroborate our our police officers going to be getting a lot of calls\nIt was based on I mean this is this going to increase the level of crazy calls coming into the police department that they're going to have to know process\nI'm sure it already has and and I spoke to a friend who was it was also a retired police officer who indicated you know and it made me think back you know rape and sexual assaults aren't the only thing people lie about it it's any way that they can abuse the system\nWhich allows them to gain an order of protection which they use a again you know towards the person that they have the order of protection against it's all a big huge abuse and I'm sure police right now are going through when I went through\nTen thirty news time\nInformation
