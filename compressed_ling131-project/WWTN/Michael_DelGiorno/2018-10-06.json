I guess I ... yeah\nI Am a cruel and league could be very serious it could be head gasket it could be read or it could be anything and it's a expensive ... or even an old truck\nLike that you don't want to have to and then there so I yeah I I Would\nDefinitely tell you to make sure that you uh do you have somebody look at that inspect that vehicle where you could be smelling is coolant blown off the exhausted stripped down to something I suck in right into the air intake right there near the windshield\nOkay that could be what you're smelling um but yes when he was put pressure tester on and find out where the things we can immediately have you been adding to it\nI I yeah it's not good man you know if ... if it's leaking internally it's like really really not good I\nMean I have noticed anything in oil or what I\nCheck it I mean it had no water or a village oil well you can also burn it and put it right out the exhaust\nIt'd be ... I bought it all yeah it can but wasn't that put out or\nNot always ... would not say some not always got a bike or something nope no I've as we can slow\nOkay All right it was a very shady\nAll right man get into sharp ... trucks were dying money you don't want it to blow up on ya yeah right hopefully is just a small leak and it's not something big thank you Dave yeah\nI think you appreciate you are ... to Robert Robert what's going on\nThe um [noise] I just bought a two thousand fourteen BMW have about twenty or twenty seven thousand miles on it and I really devote your opinion it cylinder factory warranty until the choice of this\nAnd I purchased they'd be ... or ... and also a maintenance agreement through the dealer is that something you would recommend with the mouth but I Know it's going to need a break job thing a\nBridge building covered brakes typically the maintenance of the way\nThey do have a maintenance hovers brakes and\nUh all strangers and everything\nHow 'bout that forty four twenty five hundred dollars\nYeah I I mean my experience has been with all the warranties that I have multiple customers coming in all the time told me how frustrated they are\nThat whatever they have going on is not covered because of acts and I spent why and there's just so frustrating can you fix my car I'm never doing blah blah blah again\nSo um my experience has always been that warranties on a good idea and if you think about it they can't they can't offer you a warranty and make money on it which is what they have to do\nUm they paid salesman a commission they pay the dealer you know a than they have a amount put into a reserve account the street like insurance I'm the only way this thing works out is that most people don't need all that money\nSo that means that you're either writing a check or your financing with interest all those repairs and that may be less stress for you just know that you're over paying for those repairs\nSo okay um that that's how you need to view it a card that new you're probably not going to put much money into it at all for two or three years\nOkay it's just on a street yeah you'll put breaks sign you up at some tires I Know it just not covered tires right or you know you're going to put breaks on it as maybe ... you know five six hundred bucks and that might be a way to justify it but what if you don't need breaks for a year and a half or if there's you know a lot longer\nAnd then what if you don't do anything else and then what if you don't like the card and you decide in three years because you're making more money you get a promotion at work or your business is doing better that you're gonna buy something else\nI have so many customers that don't keep the car and they traded in the ... gone look how long you've kept all your other cars for and if you're like air and I actually cars for ten years of the time\nAnd when did you start putting money into why didn't start put money into and so I've had a five six years old and you just want you might even be expired by them so the short run in the odds of what is your driving style and what are the odds that you're going to trade to sing or sell it enough to keep it okay I\nAppreciate your back a bit bigger shop you got a great job in a I mean like it's just like in the ... the money that we might be better than\nI Do it when I buy a new fridge I did it when I bought my wife and when he washer and dryer not too long ago\nI just I've just one of those guys I I never buy the warranty and I rarely have to do anything and it just proves over and over in my life that ah you know they're they're making money on that off of your your so\nBut hey I could be wrong and that thing could blow up tomorrow so [laughter] well you're paid nothing for the advice of member to put some value on it [laughter]\nIt's always is that I'm sure okay thanks for your for your body\nPart buddy appreciate you think you\nGuys are weighing hang on for males you up on the other side of the uh off the air guys thank you so much this is a partial Aaron read where every Saturday every eight to nine come check this out and going to take a listen check on our website at all

providing the support for your team for the business Russia as hot jazz sort of play\nDot yes I've had Orion and this has been a business rock stars minutes\nAre you supposed to job boards that send me tons of resumes just to find a few people who are right for my job at all process was not smart and then I went to a zipper hits technologies scans formed signed the right people\nYou're going to do that that's ... that's going to be difficult especially with the HVAC as you know I may walk up to a system let's say it's a three ton I might walk up and I see a three time gas back you know and then I stick my head under the crawl space and it's got four teenage flights coming off of it when I Know there's something wrong rap there it might look great though\nAnd so you might come along behind me or in front of me if you will you look at the duct and it's all\nInsulated properly and soaked up properly it looks like it was done whale but it's not the right size well I took all that in in glance and you might not and say\nYou know that's why I say if\nIf you're gonna do it and then probably what you want to do is sit down with the codes inspector and just talk to them a little bit um you know at ... and get your coat book and and you know and and you know go off of go off of a code book and say you know because a lotta times\nWell a lot of times you know we ...\nPage or palm page of you know out of the condense or there's the arm of flakes is missing you know and it's like this you know with exclamation marks behind it well the ... was put on Nightline originally when it was run because the line sweats\nAnd it we know it's going into some somewhere interior we don't want water dripping into sheet rock inside a wall or in the addict or whatever\nLittle bits missing outside it's fine to say hey this ought to be added but it's not like a showstopper for the house the sale you know what I'm saying Ryan and write and we'd get a lot of that this is a showstopper and it's pretty ... minor stuff so\nI got ya um I don't know if that helps or not a health I appreciate there's just not I can't just sit here and give you a whole line of items because it's that\nYou know years of looking at the trade you know when I woke up and see things it's different than what you're going to walk up and say and um and and right that is why if I that's why I say if you can if you can just\nMajor on the things that you're going to be able to learn and be very confident on and you know right or wrong as opposed to trying to learn a whole new trade and be balanced in it um it's going to be maybe for you to do that\nMaybe maybe the kids just keep it keep it basic is making sure that there is operating and I'm getting a right differential temperatures are supplying return surely the with that are\nYeah yeah you can definitely do that you know you're you know we're alternately in this industry looking between Eighteen and twenty two degrees temperature drop\nAnd so you know you you turn the unit on but you need to give it some time to run you know obviously right do you want to you and white it's got a cool all the duck work now and it's got to do all the things that it's supposed to be doing I'm right and if you you know you can definitely keep it basic like that in hit some of those basic things and be fine and just you know\nMake sure the the unit's not you know laying on the side or something like that right you know in double wall type things like that shouldn't be up against the combustible service\nOr surface clear you know at the same time you know some some folks are selling houses they bought and they bought it that way you know and they're gonna they're gonna cut to be you know shock when you you tell them that that needs to be addressed\nSimply because when they bought it it was like that and now they're selling it you know it's almost kind of like it's a grandfather and type thing and hadn't been a problem since then and now you're finding a problem so [noise]\nBut and and and that's also why I say\nMaybe talk to the inspectors and just say you know when you know when they're you know if there's if there's some things that they would point out and just say hey look at these things\nAnd more right\nBecause there I mean they're not giving you a a a perspective from a contractor either they're giving you a perspective of someone who has to walk up and just make sure that things are acceptable that's what they're they're\nRight well I sure appreciate that I thank you very much art\nThings but like\nAll right let's go to me in Nashville actually Jeff Jeff in Nashville what's going on\nI think for entered my calling and sharing a\nI've been having an issue with my um air conditioner most of the summer and some last summer and what happened is to convince her when you turn it on it it freezes over\nA lot a lot and it it inside the apartment um [noise]\nSo you're doing so it's not it's actually not that you're talking about the indoor cold is Eric ... is our part outside in a port in so\nYeah there's a part outside in the art and hide and and the inside\nYou know ... and they don't like the filter on\nYou\nKnow thing that I Know what it does it mean just over\nYeah I and I mean it it when I\nYou know you got you got a problem um [noise]\nAnd you need to have somebody look at either you've got a low refrigerator charge 'em got low Airflow for some reason bullet already or something or you got low refrigerant\nOr you've got an expansion filed meter device top problem we're allowing enough\nBut it's in your refrigeration says Airflow overhead average I\nThink he ... he worked there the Arab vote because that way then it also is that when when the ban is on there is when you failed by them then the air is not coming through and I told them over and over again that did that work might get connected\nWell or but but lower well let me live on the U.S on that because we're we're just\nAbout out of time in this segment but once it freezes with I said fans trying to Politico single\nThat than will only blow what it can pool so once that I completely blocked off that area that fans spin and what is not moving anything [noise]\nAll right so you know if the ice is gone and it's still not blowing them you've definitely got an air flow issue but if the ice is there you really don't know

get on the get on the air and ask your questions ... won five seven three seven Ninety nine eighty six six one five seven three seven\nNinety nine eighty six now we uh we last caller left us some some things to talk about for a few minutes so I'm going to\nThat for a few minutes before we jump back on and take any more calls and then we'll get back to those calls hopefully after that and uh but You're welcome to go ahead and call in and get in line\nSo basically what he asked him out was return location about returned being in the middle of the house will split\nSystem um and ah versus a package system and he said it was all going to be electric so\nOr several things if you're only going to have one return the ideal there and the the audio location is in the center of the house and it's because the the you know you're basically what you're trying to do with heating and air conditioning is you're trying to take all the air in the house\nCondition it and put it back\nYou're not just manufacturing cold air and dump it into the home you're taking the air that's already in the home you're taking that are pulling into the air conditioner you're lowering the temperature and you removing humidity that's what's happening in the summertime and then you're putting it back\nSo if you put it on the far end of the house on one end\nTo chances are there's areas in that house\nThat are not going to be you're not going to be able to move the air properly now you're still going to be moving the air\nUm you know your your air conditioners going to pull basically especially as as tightly as homes are built today it's going to pull a vacuum on the home\nThat airs all eventually going to go in the system but it's just going to be more balanced and it's going to be it's going to be more efficient going to do the job better if it's in the ... if it's in a central location now one way around that is if you cannot find a central location but you have maybe a a clause it or a dead space Andra\nUnder a cabinet or in a pain free or something on one hand and then you have one on one another and maybe in a master then put to smaller ones instead of having one big one have to smaller ones have one on one hand one on the other hand um and let them and let them work together that way so\nThere's there's more than one option now obviously most contractors don't want to do that um I sing most some don't want to do that and it's not ... it's not all for nefarious reasons or anything sometimes it's because they've given the ... the contractor a price to do the house\nAnd it doesn't include a whole lot of extra\nOr returns and things of that nature\nAnd so you you might just need to pay a little more to get it done that way um you know and they may not have built into their price the money\nUm you know and and the materials to be able to do to returns but just to do one and it to be relatively close to the unit and that's the way they've got it figured and that's how they got the job\nI'm so you know you just might want to have that conversation with your heating and air conditioning contractor and just say hey you know um if we need to pay a little more to see to it that this was done in a way that we're going to be happier with it um and you're probably if you have to actually put it in the forest so you're probably not going to be happy with it most people hate stepping on those returns [noise]\nUm so if that's what you're talking about doing that's probably not going to be what you want 'em when it comes to a split system um versus a package system\n[noise] um the the package unit is easier to do it sits outside the duck or comes into the house\nIt runs through and and distributes off but\nIf you actually um when it comes to efficiencies and things of that nature a split systems always going to be better because of split system you can achieve higher efficiencies higher see writings\n'em all those type things um you know you're you can do a Seventeen or even a twenty year and burger system with those split heat pumps and get a really good get a really good system that way and you got to want to do a split unit\nUm and you can find a place typically you know I'm On that on the top floor you can easily put one in the attic and it'll be on the way that way on the bottom floor you should be able to find somewhere in that basement that you can set it and run that duck work off of it to get to where you need to be\nUm but I Would do split systems you're going to want at least two units\nOne to do the top floor and want to do the main floor and possibly handle the basement as well but some of that depends on how big that basements going to be what you're going to use it for\nThose as there's a lot of variables that go into that to make sure you got a contractor that's interested in talking to you about it\nUm if he's like this is just the way it's going to be and there's really no uh there's really no discussion on it you probably got the wrong guy looking at it you want somebody who's going to explain to you and give me some options like here's the best way this is what I Would do this is what it's going to cost you could do this it's but it's not quite as good\nAs it was somebody who kind of walk you through and talk you\nTalk you through it so I Hope that helps um we may come back to that a little bit more if we can if we can get through these calls will see a little bit so let's go ahead and jump on the calls um\n[noise] it looks like who have that we've got somebody that I have NO NAME or anything for who is that given to you know that I just see it\nI don't know you can you hear me you're on the air if you can hear [laughter]\nHello I this is Jeff where they fishing they Carolyn how are you\nHearing barrel\nWell there you go Gary I'm all it says I'm Talking to you on a different line than I Am okay gear well I don't know what happened that's a computer glitch but your own and we're willing to talk to you what's going on\nOkay great that was um you know am I supposed filters in the home that would ban the Home Depot they have the rain and they changed that brand that something how true blue whistles is there one brand it better than the other is going to you know I just want feels that they do the job of the\nBetter [laughter]\nHonestly I I did I Do not keep up with with filters and things of that nature but I can tell you that if it's whistling probably cutting down there floating much so you do when I go back to a different one\nUm and just hope and and moved to one that's not going to cause it to whistle because it sounds like it's it's restricting your air flow enough that the the unit struggling to get the air that he needs he shouldn't whistle soaked in blood\nOut there I mean what brain than in the what\nWhat were you know when when you see like the name of rain on a filter rains not making any filters I make air conditioning equipment what they've done is they've they've uh they've they've partnered with someone else to put their name on that filter\n'em and they're getting a little spin off off of it and the other companies you know oh well I'm going to rain unit I Need to get rain filter you know it's that kind of mentality when it has absolutely nothing to do with\nWith whether or not system work because it doesn't change anything you know it's just filter\nSo you can use any filter you need to but you do you really do need to get one and done with\nJohn okay well great thanks very much yeah we'll get that you do like you\nAll right and let's go to ray in ... are you there\nI Know it's like very okay well let's let's remember it was a Thirteen year old and he\nEven if it was a four to an system and so he bumped you're you're only talking about the heat up having forty eight thousand BTU use of capacity and its maximum and drops it drops with it\nIf you put a gas system of the same C. F. E. a moment and you're going to have anywhere from Seventy five to a hundred thousand BTU use of gassy so yeah it's just go it's going to do uh uh\nI hate to use the word better because you better implies efficiency as well which is not the case but as far as comfort goes\nUm and the ease of which the gas will be able to hate the home the gas is just going to have a lot easier time because you've got to have more BDUs available to you to do that well and so what would\nBe a ballpark figure oh night you know like ... can you do that All right yeah\nYeah well it's not that I Can't do that it said I don't have the information I Need to to to do it I'm OK obviously we'd be glad to take a look at it in quotes for free and we'd be glad to have to look at it and tell you what it would cost\n... but I Need I Need to know what you have a need to know the time they need to know it is you know split package had set up you know whether the details of the Institute born unit do sense a package unit yeah so I mean there's there's a lot of variables that go into it\nI get here next week in sounds great call her\nA cold or tell us at the office you'll get Kelly call us like that one five you got something wrong with that I'll give you the number is sick I Won five seven eight\nFor forty four twenty four sold it for political yesterday or the bikes are\nAre you sir thanks to All right let's go to Edward in\n... I think Edward or you might remember\nThat L'Engle in limbo\nYeah ... ... oh you're in limbo now if you're Donald ... Columbia, Tennessee yeah I Know I'm ... I had I actually grew up in corners will Tennessee oh yeah you're down the highway yeah the ... not just running down the road so what's going on ever\nOK I'm Catholic doctrine sweating real bad [noise] gets made the trunk lines on that trunk lines and French line\nLike that and the inside the insulation it's all wet around the get go that route route get fat and you know\nIt's I guess related the underneath my house okay that's still gets in the yellow problem one thing I did notice not like what am I to be a problem uh we changed out the trunk line oh about five years ago\nIn boots I think you can get enough information when it goes up in the house and they're they're metal there and I was wondering that\nSweating a duck to bring that forced her down into my information on the coach\nMy French ... there\nWere some of that depends on how close those two things are together like if you're let's say you got a twenty five foot flex Lon goes up ties into a booth and that but it's not insulated very well and then about somewhere in the middle that flex fund sweat and they don't have you with each other it just has to do with the\nUm the amount of humidity in the air and the temperature that that flakes line is getting\nUm you know there's obviously still quite a bit of humidity in that crawl space yeah and and edited\nThere still is extremely bad in my back home and I had a house\n... put a piece of plastic in here and I am I checked it out on the Internet you know the cats and like you got something like that\nRight so a well I Would I Would look into the humidifier that's the direction I Would go if I Would you start with okay and just even if you you know if you buy your own humidifier you sound like you're you're pretty handy and can handle things yourself so\nRight I Would give me a humidifier and put it in that space and then just drain the drain to the outside of the of the house right that way you didn't have to go under there any empty it or anything and plug it thing you know let it go and write it start pulling that humidity out for you should\nDo they make 'em even fired specially on early called faces\nUm [noise] I don't think there's especially for underneath there but what you're looking for is a is a larger capacity you're looking for more of a commercial grade or something like that yeah I've got back to a two hundred where\nI Would I Would want a hundred and twenty pie per day if I could get it\nOkay if you look for a hundred and twenty five per day that's typically about the biggest\nI'm reasonably priced one that they make a you know when you can you can set that guy in there and let him go and you'll do a great job for it and it's those bigger ones like that are designed so that you they don't even have a story\nThere set up so you know you you install the things and plug in and they have filters on them and then they have a dream pork so you can just hooked up to the drawing board and run the drain outside and there is no there is no you know drawer to take out and dumped the water or any of that kind of stuff it's not it's not your typical one room the humidifier\nOkay one more of a quick

Scott thanks for calling fire away with your question\nSo I worked at a company for Twenty years of got out of four one K. are still was a it it's through fidelity and it's about four hundred thousand dollars and a lot of that is tied up in that particular comedy stock\nI Would like to bring that from Fidel combine it with my current uh but somebody mentioned something about there might be a penalty because it's in stock and movie that I don't quite understand that\nScott there should not be a penalty but you probably won't be able to transfer the stock from your old employer to your new employer\nSo I don't want to have this years I'd like to sell off this year okay that are pretty good price right now so I Would like to take the lump sum yep but I'm not sure so first of all there's no penalty then what would you suggest I go to what that four hundred thousand\nSo let's talk location first you can sell the stock take that four hundred grand from the old plan then move it to the new four one K. or you could move that money into something called a roll over IRA with both of those you know we're just dealing with account type\nNow regarding asset allocation\nAnd that's just the investments that you're going to buy with the money right stocks bonds cash\nWithin the roll over IRA you openness on an open platform Schwab and you know theoretically the sky's the limit thousands of stocks bonds mutual funds E. T. S. all at your disposal but if you move the money into your new for all and K plan\nYou'll likely see a much more limited selection of sons or institutional holdings\nThe thing is some plans give you access to a lot\nBut others you only see a handful of investment options\nGreat thank you so much man have a good weekend you till\nWhen you think about it you know folks who change jobs pretty often it's so easy to lose track of old for one caves and I'm guessing that there is a pretty good number of Americans that have for one case that are not being a tend to\nHave slowly it's a common situation and it could end up being a huge issue for investors down the road if you can relate if you could use some help simplifying\nConsolidating investing your savings get over to investing sense dot com start talking with our local team\nSo let's go back to Scott's situation and talk about holding a large position in the stock of a company that you work for within a four one K. to stop us through those considerations\nWhen my clients hold large positions in their employer stock\nIt's usually a pretty emotional situation yes it's normal yes it's a human reaction but I see this attachment to the stock like I Do not see with any of their holding\nThese emotions can sometimes make it kind of difficult to objectively analyzed the risk and the risk has to do with holding a highly concentrated position in one lone stock or even more and ... and really importantly you've got to take into account where you are in life\nDo you really want to risk most of your retirement success on the performance an outcome the success or failure of one lone investment there's a just a huge risk here in the situation\nWell and I can hear some people asking well wait a second the risk and holding a concentrated position in stock and go both ways there's the potential for a high reward or return but they just like you mentioned there's also the potential for big big risk\nOh yeah and you know here's two examples let's say you work for Apple you hold a large position in a ... out in your four one K. it's done great over the last few years and you've been rewarded for taking that risk\nBut now considered to former American blue chip stocks got General Electric and Sears won a famous industrial giants or the other one of the most iconic retail brands in this country if you worked at either of these companies and all you owned was concentrated position in that company stock\nThe risk is that you would not have been able to retire because of all you own was G. E. or S H O D you probably would have lost a ton of money in your four one K.\nAnd by the way the broader stock market has been in a bull market for more than nine years and that means an index fund would have been a much better place than either of these two stocks over that same period of time\nOr lighting your money on fire would have been a much better for you know kind of outcome you know worst case scenario is that your stock goes to zero\nAnd even though this doesn't happen very often it can happen I mean remember names like leaving a WorldCom Enron these companies had employees who held lots of company stock and for one case they loved it when the stock went up but what do you think happened\nWhen it didn't yeah it just went down to zero\nZero okay and the only defense against this company specific risk is diversification and we build this into all of our clients personalized plans if you could use some help get some help get over to investing sense dot com and and start talking with our local team\nWell that brings us to this week's portfolio review and a quick reminder please consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor in your area by going to investing sense dot com now in future shows if you would like to have Andy review your portfolio here during the show\nAsked Andy at investing sense dot com is the email right portfolio review in the subject line but it's pretty easy ask any at investing sense dot com so Jackie\nSet us her portfolio last week and she writes I have a question regarding bond funds and CDs\nWhich is better at this point bond funds seemed destined to lose value in a rising interest rate environment individual bonds pay the state of interest rate is held to a majority but Kerry default risk CDs pay this stated rate it held the maturity and our FDIC insured\nIf you were to get an inflation move like that and you then raise the interest rate would you be tight or we just be responding to conditions for him\nTo be a two percent inflation and a two percent of veterans right let's just say that's normal well if you're a three percent inflation shouldn't go to three percent but that was right does that mean anything's actually any tighter no\nRight does a rate hike now and do continued rate hikes through the rest of the year the water the politics of that especially here in a in a midterm election cycle if I think\nWhatever politics are are ah there's not going to be I think there's not another meeting until after the terms okay ... maybe just a day or two before but uh I think the fed has made it clear that they're only going to rate hikes at alternating meeting okay I'm\nEven if they surprised by doing a rate hike just before the terms uh\nEat and then even if that rate hike was a mistake that slow the economy right there's no way that we have the slightest sick on anybody or anything\nFor months and so the idea that that would make anybody you know less satisfied with Republican leadership um you know it was a vote or you know that kind of narrative there are many different narrative uh it'd be it's just absurd\nShift that whatever affect the federal have it it's going to habits are they have it so if it's going to the election it already has well\nLet's talk about the terms I mean you have you've gone out there and said that you know midterms are basically a referendum on whether America is glad I got what I Want to talk about that talk about how you are looking at the ... that the midterms right now and what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\nUm typically in the terms and you can go back many many many many years and look at the historical record others it's quite clear it seems that way the economy is strong or weak whether the president was popular or unpopular what tends to happen\nIs whatever party does not control the White House makes big gains in the house and Senate okay and that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American salt and or maybe it's part of the human fossil except the American system so little unique but the\nSo we see it here but for most people politics is like the Olympics\nWere were you get interested in sports once every four years right or at least you get interested in things like gymnastics once every four years so the uh\nThe people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around that immigrants four years ago it was a Republican\nYou know one of the things that that were asked a lot about is what we're kind of seeing what we are tracking um especially on the trade side you know as the as the U.S China story kind of continues to move forward or in some\nRespects metastasize as we see the additional tariffs um you know they they've taken effect after their announcement\nAfter promises of you know the Chinese retaliation and you and I talked about this in the past in terms of then kind of coming out and saying you know we're not going to devalue\nWhat happened right after the recent move or the the recent announcement on the tariffs I especially as it relates to us equities in Chinese equities ... you know you were tracking that\nBut what happened after this announcement or a question\nBecause what's been happening all during this trade war which really started march is us stocks of basically crawled straight straight up I'm Chinese toxic wrote straight straight down there the downright they're a market\nAnd their currencies but at the same thing so if you're a lot of Chinese investor who had to buy the Chinese currency to buy stocks you got it off with the stock that the currency like history or thirty five percent this year\n[noise] so what happened after\nSort of the worst of all their houses came out a week ago if the u._s. stock market went up the stock market went up twice as much so that wasn't supposed\nTo have [laughter] yeah it is\nOne of the things that was driving the sink or an early conclusion\nWas the financial pressure being put on the Chinese by their stock market by their currency market by their bond market you know all of which are in great distress and we're sending a useful signals with the Chinese that as painful as it is going to be for you to capitulate to Trump\nIt's even more painful to you to have your economy of blow to have what we really do the first ever reception but it is in China as a modern economy\nThat was Don Luskin he's the chief
