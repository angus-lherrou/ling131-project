I've got that ... Thirty Years' worth\nGreat but I noticed that this kind of a rifle in their final flooring and then got on the house about an eight foot circled around that the that is totally so\nThe point the fifth year underline a and everything's just can't have against marchers stuff is you can stick your finger threat I Wonder what went around I have a pretty big\nUh open a cross eyed and a lot of men that are open and I know a lot of people are closed them up now I'm so I'm just\nWondering what your thoughts on that was definitely came on the net are now in that race\nWell everything every house has different and that's that's part of the problem with same practices all the time and what what we do in Nashville and I will tell you what the habits through there and what we do with the the proper the correct way to do it\nIs when you put a Viet under a a cabinet you're supposed to have a piece of duct work which we typically use what's called wall stack because it'll fit inside of too well for wall it's typically three and a quarter by\nUm ten inches or twelve inches or or whatever why um and that that duct work will fit underneath a cabinet and typically you can tie into come straight down to Tokyo week um and direct that air and of course we insulated to sell the air comes up into that piece of ducked into go straight out the toast\nIt without landing in under the cabinet [noise] um and I I give me all that detail because with every house being different I'm like you I've seen I've seen a hundred houses where the event went straight up and under the cabinet\nAir ... came out either over the top of the Tokyo if they leave a U.S base there or they cut a hole in it and put a little a little grill on it and it was never a problem\nBut then there's other homes where there's more humidity there or there was more humidity and the crawl space and you know there's it's it's it's reacting to the humidity and the crawl space or under the cabinet or a combination of both to make it do that\nOr there's no way of knowing which houses going to do what so that's why it's best just to have that piece of duck work under their if they're gonna have to probably pull the island anyway because they're going to have to fix that so if they if they pull that island to that's the time to have that piece of duct put under there and fix it and then it should be an issue after that [noise]\nOkay our most people are feeling that there are places now\nThat is still the uh the ongoing debate there's a lot of folks that are doing the encapsulated crawl space where they're in camps delighting in the closing off those events\nUm but if you do that in my opinion is still need to get some air flow [noise] um and you need to be moving air out of that crawl space because you don't want it uh especially in kind of positive pressure and that crawls by that would be enforced the air from the cross spice up into the house so I'll read\nI think it would have been a fan pulled out the a and one of the doubt well one of them here oh\nYeah you can you can put an exhaust fan to take the air out um and uh and either if you dumping the air off the air conditioning system into that space which you can but if you do that it needs to be done in a way that they're that no air is allowed to go back into the system from the cross by a\nLot so there's ... there's some analysis now no return\nBest route there's some controls that have to be put in there for it to be done that way worse case you could just put an exhaust fan down there and let it exhaust out um mine than it would have it would pull some of the air you know whether it was where weather report it through walls are or\nWhere the where the plumbing fixtures went up or whatever you could you could you could get some natural air movement from up above down below\nWorst case but you'd you'd definitely don't want it to building a positive pressure up there and then forces walk up you don't want that\n... thing art thanks one\nArt this the efficient heating and cooling our we're we're getting close close to time is that you may have about a minute left to jump in here at six one five seven three seven Ninety nine eighty six six one five seven three seven Ninety nine eighty six\nA crawl spaces and humidity and mole have become a big topic issues it seemed like over the last few years and and some of that I Will tell you is because homes are getting so much more tighter people are spending more time in there\nI'm now a lassie lives in the house with everybody else to do so there's there's more a\nA dangerous and hair and things in the air so there's a allergy problems and sneezing and different things going on and all kinds of issues to deal with and that's where indoor air quality becomes um

a long arrest record it has been described as troubled correspondent Jo Jones who's in Miami this morning a\nPicture that is emerging as a man who harbor some very dark thoughts particularly about minorities and others in this country particularly on the left and now authorities are trying to find out if the fourteen bombs they know of or the end of it\nA nine hundred million but none of taxes you can only about half the team so no outfielders for you forget about the Yankees they're worth four billion dollars\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because the total GDP of the British Virgin islands as about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one tell nobody\nThat you won not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also to\nStrangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe like a bank safe deposit box you know not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know what's the group was my house no\nAntibiotics that deposit box do not signed the ticket not yeah\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because guess what you're not wealthy\nAnd left a lawyer to tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it in your name only should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an El Al field limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice to you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done a lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy and we're not going to lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottom list but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million of taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start going out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say all of a kid growing in my work every day like always now you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are gonna be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life's not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live he's always do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to extort from you blackmail\nYou so you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich to be with me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change in ways you have never thought possible because you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you just method after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you give them a million bucks you'd ... come on you're going to give her\nTen million you just got a Ninety million dollars how much given your mom\nHow much you've given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that is a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars\nYou know my friend not now you\nHave to pay a gift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you\nIncur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so of the four hundred and Ninety two that you now did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it\nYou're now down to three fifty we haven't even talked about charity\nLet alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them and whatever you do for them ain't got to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invest it into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars guess what you'll have won the lottery of course pass performance is known kitchen future results on the assertion that country's a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket\nBecause as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and I mentioned all of this one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one subject\nAren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you not win the lottery on\nTuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that not only did you get rich you've got a little poorer because of the stock market's performance and we're going to talk about the stock market\nAnd what it means for your investments in what you should do about your investments strategy as a result of the new volatility that we're experiencing in the stock market and the bond\nMarket and the real

Social Security could result in twenty percent more benefits over your lifetime this is Scott fuel with financial engines here in Nashville and Murphy's for and I can actually go to invest shows sense dot com today\nAnd that's exactly what George dead here says question he sent to ask wreck at ... dot com\nDirect this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and\nI'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much interest I might only pay one or two or three percent puts so what\nYou don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could so traditionally we what are you don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but\nLet me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider a riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nPut the money into those call today but think about this when you die\nWho get that money\nAnd willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours it's ... and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nWell then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that none of taxes and inflation is growing in real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on bears and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the farm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic\nLook at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources and design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your

we lament\nIn this country that there is a substantial amount of financial illiteracy\nUh parents seemed to be talking to their kids about everything these days religion politics drugs sex but they're

published\nAnd it covers everything about personal finance from getting out of debt and dealing with credit all the way to multimillion dollar states and everything in between\nUh and the first three parts of that book are really aimed perfectly for your children understanding what is money held his money work of understanding compound growth\nA and the very basics of money so I Would encourage your kids to read the truth about money second\nI'm going to direct you to a website called jumpstart dot org\nThe jumpstart coalition for personal financial literacy is a nonprofit organization that
