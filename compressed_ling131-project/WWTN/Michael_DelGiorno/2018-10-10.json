before and we've been broke down the media research or the ... analysis and you see bias within the stories they cover\nAs well as by the stories they cover so this is the president during an economic boom with a lot of success some regulations to tax cuts to increase jobs increased wages record low unemployment repatriated money in countries are are companies moving back to our country\nLess than one percent coverage on that\nAnd Ninety two percent negative and no matter what is happening choosing now two years into a Russian investigation going nowhere\nTo immigration policies unreasonably unbiased to the cabinet nominations in North Korea diplomacy and relations with Russia so it is a reminder of how biased works these people are very I said to the death of journalism is what took place in twenty sixteen not just an upset if Hillary Clinton\nAnd uh they're biased by the stories that covered the stories they don't how they cover mangoes they choose angles they ignore people they talked to people they don't quote they use quotes they don't and they're biased from head to toe\nYou are literally see a hostility towards the president of the United\nStates like never before seen in television history don't even get me started on print [noise] so we have intolerance\nAnd leftist politics from people we don't buy their records or watch their movies or TV shows for their politics we have a biased deaths of journalists middle man in the mainstream media\nAnd then we have what appears to be great anger and hate\nAnd that begs the question I I look back at the ... side of the fact that they once crucified Sarah pay for using the political expression of targeted districts\nThat level of sensitivity and at the time I Would have executed it as as the president of the United states\nIs generating up riots in the streets\n\nAnd that kind of ... did lead\nTo a leftist showing up and shooting members of Congress men members of Congress that were Republicans on a baseball field\n\nThere should be a shared accountability\nSo everybody sees whether they're paid operatives by George Soros or rather radical organizations\nWhether they're sitting members of the

said\n\nFollowing the bitterly partisan confrontation battle over Brett Kavanaugh Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky warned in an interview on Tuesday that heated political rhetoric has the potential to turn deadly quote I fear that there are going there's going to be an assassination I said there's two years ago\n\nMy chief concern is for the president of the United states and the many public rallies he does and the way everybody unreasonably\nCan you believe that the left in the media and the left in politics is framing this as a referendum against the president are you kidding me for what doing what he said for what is working no you just hate him\nAnd there's people that are violent and hate listening and getting ginned up my first and foremost fear is for the president the United states but certainly high profile members of the Republican Party\n\nPeople like Maxine Waters and die in fights and they literally ginned up people\nTo confront these members of Congress on the street members of Congress had their interns revealing\nTheir addresses putting them in hard and then you see him on TV they're nuts\n\nYou getting paid vigilante nuts\nAccess to members of Congress has addresses\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination Paul told the Kentucky radio show I really worry that somebody's going to be killed\nAnd that those who are ratcheting up the conversation they have to realize they bear some responsibility if that celebrates the violence yes well it has in the past but if in the future\nFalls comments came the same day former candidate Hillary Clinton declared the Democrats cannot be civil not with Republicans any longer\nWho's Jennings or a partisan intolerant rhetoric the left or the right who's been carrying out the physical

around the house lost\nShe also wrote an op ed published by CNN and what she called on senator Cory Booker to tone down his rhetoric in June bookers suggested his supporters get up in the face of congresspeople\nNow might not interpret that the Kentucky senator reiterated his wife's criticism on Tuesday when people like Cory Booker say get up in their face what he doesn't realize is that for every one thousand persons\nWho want to get up in your face one of them gonna be unstable enough to commit a violent act\nIs my computer on\nI Hope there's not an adverse but here's Hillary Clinton secretary of state that's about that\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nI got hit pause right there is Hillary Clinton suggesting that we shouldn't be civil towards her\nTowards democratic members of the Senate Democratic members of the house is Hillary unaware of the fact that we view her and her party as someone trying to destroy what we believe\n\nJust being pro abortion not equate with being pro death for the baby and doesn't that destroy life just socialism not destroy capitalism rich does redistribution of wealth not take my wealth and give it to someone else\nDo open borders not destroy legal entry\n\nAnd these people are mentally ill there spiritually disordered their narcissistic but by and large
