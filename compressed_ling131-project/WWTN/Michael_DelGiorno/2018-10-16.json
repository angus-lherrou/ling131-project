the full forecast standard traffic update in five minutes in Turkish authorities say they have found evidence in the Saudi consul age\nThat writer Jamal ... she was killed there this will secretary of state Mike Pompeo is meeting with the king and Saudi Arabia to try to get some answers surrounding his disappearance\nJust a brief exchange him which might have been some and says we are any strong and old ally so we face out challenges together the past the day off tomorrow I'm comparing replies absolutely\nSam ... says Turkish crime scene investigators rent the Saudi ... for three hours overnight and he may be gone but those who knew the tech giant Paul Allen said his work will continue\nBiased biased biased biased\nAnd that's unfortunate because that was new if I'm trying to be an unbiased reporter if I'm trying to uh an unbiased Lee is that a word give you information that is a story\nAnd they ... it took hours for them to cover that I Can't even remember now what they were covering yesterday Oh yes I Do that they're breaking news and it was important\nWas the fact that the Saudi Government was now coming out and saying OK okay gee that journalist [noise] may have died while he was in the consulate\nAnd interrogation may have gone horribly wrong and now we're going to take responsibility for it that's what was breaking yesterday and and although that is true\nThat that should be your number one story that's important that Stormy Daniels story I think important as well so it just kills me\nHe was me that they had nothing oh well it took hours\nFor them to have anything on it and you don't see continuous coverage you don't see interviews with Michael I have a nominee who loves his Fifteen minutes of fame nope he just said we're going to appeal the decision\nI find that hilarious I Will be surprised if they do appeal well I think it's all be I think he's just yeah I just ... ... yeah it\nKeeps the story going and you know at this point truthfully ... they ought to just drop it all I mean I\nThink we as American people were done with it just stop there's there's other things as millennia Trump set in her interview with ABC twenty twenty and more important things to think about\nIt more important things to do more issues that are more pressing\nThan whether in on Donald Trump had an affair years ago tried to cover it up with money et cetera et cetera don't care I I honestly don't care\nNow if he did it while he was president that's a different story for those accusations to my knowledge of\nNever come out All right so glad to have you on board nine twelve I'm Pamela for and for Michael Dell joined a little later on in the program and the eleven o'clock hour we will have metro city council member\nRobert swooping in the studio to discuss the upcoming election I Do believe early voting starts tomorrow here in the state of Tennessee am I right about now are correct yet\nSo um if you want to get your vote on [laughter]\nThan we that's ... that's what you need to do um but in metro Nashville wheat that several amendments on our ballot\nThat we as citizens need to uh pay attention to one of those the big one it's a amendment one is the oversight board that I'm I Can't remember the name of that group citizens now or something like that and I apologize I should matter the oversight now thank you\nThey're the ones that want this community oversight board and so\nWe're going to discuss that and and discuss is that good for the city is that bad for the city\nDon't we already have some sort of oversight board\nWithin the city that looks over these cases that involve police officers\nBy the way I Do believe there's even a story today about officer ... he's the one uh that shot Daniel hand brake three times as hamburger was running from him\nAnd I I'm not going to say alleged because that's not allege that that happened what they're trying to determine is whether it's considered a homicide or not that's what he's going\nTo court for\nAnd I believe they've set another like a hearing date for some time in November So anyway so we're going to talk about that today it's important to voters to know what exactly it is you're voting on there are several amendments on the ballot here in Davidson county so that's coming up at eleven o'clock or be listening for that\nI found this article very interesting guys\n[noise]\nIt's an article from the daily mail which I seem to find more and more interesting article there than I than I Do my own American newspapers like the New York times and the like\n[noise] and I have to\nSay these are interesting tips do you ever get around somebody and you look at him and they're\nTalking you're thinking they're lying to me boy\nThat's a whopper of a story that's a doozy right there and you just look at 'em and shake your head but you want to go don't don't lie to me well this article tells you how you can spot a liar\nAnd and the reason why I'm bringing it up I Know you're probably thinking that's such a chick thing to talk about and I don't even want to hear it I think you could use these methods when you're talking to political candidates\nOf course the old joke goes I can you tell your candidate is lying there just their lips are moving right [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut in this article behavioral psychologist Joe Hemings reveals signs of lying\n\nYou can look at their facial expressions you can\nLook at their body language you can listen to what they say and if they repeat words and I can go on and on and in fact I'm going to bring this to you but again I think that this is important information even from a political standpoint or just from a how to get ahead in in the workplace\nOr how to get ahead with your business or or your career or in your relationships or whatever the case may be if you can spot these particular signs and and the truth is nobody likes to be lied to now do they know I don't I Can't stand\nTo be lied to the pet peeve even white lies drive me crazy now we all do it but\nAssuming you know a friend quite well here you go you'll be familiar with their usual facial expressions the way they smile the way they laugh how they stand if they look you're dead straighten yeah when you're having a conversation\nYou recognize the signs if it's\nIf it's a friend you know their mood in all of these things\nThey blush\nThe case may be so with a friend it's really really easy to spot when they're lying here's a for instance with than manned is today he tried to make me think that he was so ticked off at me\nAnd I just looked at him I said don't even try 'cause I can I can tell when you're faking you know I mean the when he's really ticked off his bald head turns red ... or ... the tip of is not these are the two of his his nose turns red I mean I work with them every single day I see them every single day\nSo those are the tells that he has a probably shouldn't have done but you can't really control you know I I Can't sit here and say I need to be a better liar so I'm going to make my face turned ... I mean that's something that's just a natural occurrence that you\nThat you do but in my line to you right now I'm a you're looking me dead straight in the eye Chris now feel a little\nTrouble screwed [laughter] your scrutinizing anyway or colleague unlike a friend who is familiar and a personal setting a work colleague who may mask their feelings and a professional environment may be trickier to spot lying\n... and that's probably true because I probably now with Dan he and I work so closely together\nI mean I he I mean I have a little temper and he sees it probably just about every day 'cause he's the one I'm telling off he's the one I get mad at but with you Chris or with Ken I you know you guys probably have this very professional\nYou know I Can't think of anything personal that we discuss and was how's your mom and then that kind of thing\nBut I don't you know I mean it's very professional so I don't know that I could tell if you were lying every word I say it's all a lot well integrated all ... again you know you're a man your lips are moving a I Am I [laughter] but you still have\nTo you have to look at the body language of everybody in and see if there's something different than the norm that's what you're looking for\nIt's also now see they don't even have to tell me that if I can tell you this myself [noise]\nWhen somebody is telling you a story and it keeps getting outrageous and outrageous for instance if somebody is a late to work or decides not to come in oh my gosh my grandma ... I just found out she's you know when you come up with these grandiose stories\nYou have to go ... I'm not so sure that person is telling the truth or I I was on the interstate and this guy pulled a gun and I didn't know what to do some pulled over to the side of the road and then my car wouldn't start and then somebody rain in the back\nYou know they're lying when you come up with those kinds of things anyway it's just it's an interesting article if you want to see it just go to Facebook my Facebook page and you'll see it there how to spot a liar and again I think you can use these things even with\nPolitical candidates as you're looking at their body language are they looking you dead straight in the eye or even if they're looking you in the rye or they blinking that's another one\nIf they're blinking normally I think you're fine if their eyes are wide open and not blinking [laughter] that is a sign that their seriously that they're lying or if they look to the left and up that's a sign that they're looking for\nOccasionally leaned describing I I kind of cover up jobs by the Saudis\nThe state department says secretary of state Mike Pompeo met with Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince to discuss the disappearance of ...\nAnd a relayed his concerns about the case to those two people in the Florida Panhandle going door to door where doors are still standing there trying to locate loved ones days after hurricane Michael\nCity clerk and they're in Mexico beach said Sunday ... forty six people were still unaccounted for and here's a story from the how's that working out for you file\n...

saw this story real quick this was just ... you know you know how we were talking about my eyes earlier if you are listening at the very beginning at nine o'clock there was an article out how to um\nHow to tell if someone is lying to you and what the tell tale signs are a from a person that may be telling you a lot and then I I Wonder what the telltale sign is on this story\nOut of Florida Lakeland, Florida she was arrested for these stabbing death of her husband and\nThey have determined his desk to be\nHomicide it was a four month investigation she was arrested today charged with second degree murder her name is Rachel fit at the end I guess is how you pronounce it\nHer husband Brian died in June after he was stabbed in the shoulder\nBy his wife she claimed the incident was accidental and gave very is inconsistent explanations of what happened one explanation she said\nShe was walking toward her husband while walked well while holding or dog in\nOne hand and then knife and the other\nEnd she tripped and stabbed him [laughter] so I Wonder [laughter] but the telltale sign on that one was [noise]\nShe changed her story later and said she was slicing pizza doing the dishes and tripped and stabbed him or\nThe other story was she was dealing with dog feces after her dog desiccated on himself\nAnd tripped and\nStabbed her husband's so [laughter] none of the explanations were plausible really [laughter] hello nice [laughter] nine times yeah [laughter] a long time so it has to show it was clumsy [laughter]\nAs to show how she was\nHolding the dog Rachel couldn't even pick up the dog at all and in addition the road she had allegedly been wearing that morning had no poop on it [laughter] or pee on it\nNor did the living room where she said the dog poop themselves so nothing added up at all made a lot of excuses none of them made since\nThey did a thorough investigation they determined this was an intentional act of domestic violence but its flipped to the woman that stand [laughter]\nI'm Sorry not funny he died stabbed her husband and the shoulder and somehow he died I guess the shoulders close to the heart or if you're bleeding to death you know you could you die from that but [laughter]\nI'm Sorry I'm Sorry Mr deputy I tripped I didn't mean to stand them four times it's like those people that say I didn't mean to have an affair\nIt was an accident [laughter]\nLast I'm Sorry I didn't mean to sleep with you [laughter] kills\nMe absolutely kills me so there's that you know she might be lying story of the day here's another one for you\nIn and didn't county Minnesota now this one this one's not so funny\nYou have\nPeople who are angry these days I mean just angry there they're mad hateful hateful people\nEspecially if you say I'm a Republican well this is a Republican candidate running for a state seat in Minnesota is running for for the house of representatives there apparently he was at a bar in St George township Minnesota\nAnd\nStruck up a conversation with a guy sitting beside him in and I got to be honest I like going to to local taverns if you will I'm sitting at the bar and I ... again I'm nosy girl so I I actually eavesdrop I like to listen to what people are talking about\nAnd depending on the bar and depending on the area of town\nYou can figure out somebody going to start talking about politics are they going to be talking about football are they going to talk about millennial problems of\nHow am I going to get my ... birds scooter [laughter] to get to the next bar you know you just you know depending on what part of town so apparently they started talking about politics\nThis Republican candidate for house of representatives in the state of Minnesota and this other dude and somehow or another I guess his name is ... and\nHe's he's shame me cleaned as the one running for governor I'm Sorry house of representatives and he made some comment about the middle class and before you know it he got punched right in the face [laughter]\n\nAnd he said he suffered a concussion and felt that the man's actions\nWere politically motivated you think [laughter]\nNow I Wonder what he could have said about the middle class poor white trash but that would be the poor that wouldn't be middle class middle class redneck\nDo you call people in Minnesota rednecks at all oh oh yeah there are there are there redneck ... yeah I don't know but I I I Can't imagine what\nHow you know what kind of insulting oh I'm In could be made about the middle class is just gonna cause somebody to clinch\nTheir fist and punch in the face but that's what happens in Minnesota with this political candidate I guess my point is any there's hate everywhere\nYou as a Republican you've got to watch these days of the brain was talking about the restaurant and it was mount Juliet or or Lebanon\nCoordinates the meeting three place they fed a political candidates they fed this the staff of Marsha Blackburn and they were born dirt on social media for it which is and and\nPeople threatening them\n\nAt some point I'm not so sure the government should mandate a little bit of ... and our water and just give it to

continuing coverage updates on air and online as soon as they're available reporters say that the Saudi council has left town is Turkish forensic teams prepare to search is home and the disappearance of Washington Post contributor Jamal ...\nIt's actually worse than that I tell them to leave it or not um amendment one basically established as a community oversight board something that we have been I'm not going to say arguing we'd have been a a discussing discussing you know in a very candid way for well over a year probably up to Eighteen months now\nWith the police department the attorney general's office ... office with a number of community organizations and with with with all due respect to all the community organizations out there from know on down and even anti phone black lives matter I understand\nYou have concerns but I think the community oversight board is an absolutely very very poor way to achieve what they want but I think it's dangerous ... it's it's incredibly dangerous the the way the language reason this amendment literally an illegal alien could be appointed to this board\nAny legal not even a citizen correct as this country correct can be a part of their support\nAn illegal alien could be a part to be a member of this loving loving person board but let's look at it from a from a much more tactical standpoint Charlie\nAndme NPT has one of the best reputations not only in the state but in the country um nationwide officers are held held accountable at a rate of about eight to ten percent of the national average ...\nOur officers are held to a thirty six percent accountability that's insane and we always have um a ... and all the eight precinct captains for doing an amazing job in the city were growing at a hundred and six people that they are now okay yeah that yeah it's insanity and\nWe just took money away from the police department and I'm also I tried not to do that but I got over room and um but as a consequence you know we have Eighteen hundred Nineteen hundred officers\nWe need more we need another five hundred honest with you I'm this community oversight board doesn't even begin to take into account that there are already eight levels of oversight on our police department\nYeah explained that 'cause I I've actually had some conversations with people I don't know that many citizens here in metro now that they don't there's already oversight if he well\nCorrect and and to be honest with you I didn't know it until I took a deep dive into all this to actually understand it but you start with the civilian led office of professional accountability ... this is already a quote civilian oversight board if you wanted to look at it and\nThen you've got the Tennessee bureau of investigation which as of a year and a half ago any officer related shooting is now completely investigated by the lead guy yeah and and I have an immense respect for the CPI is well they do an amazing job in the state\nThen you've got the day was and kind of a grand jury system mhm which if you look at the the case of officer dulcie and the one thing I Will comment and this is a personal comment and a personal only you know [noise] I I think attorney general funk as a great job in the city is a very very smart student man\nI don't know why he didn't put this to a grand jury before he fi case against officer ... but but again I don't know why that didn't happen yeah and and we'll find out in in as this all plays forward but for right now we do have the grand jury process which is completely civilian\nThen you've got the district attorney's office and on top of that you've got the Federal Bureau of investigation which anytime the TV I gets involved the FBI is always looking over their shadow is going to say at least\nConsulted probably yup then you've got the department of justice criminal courts and civil courts that all over the the police department I how many more people need to be looking over ... our police department shoulder\nAnd how many when the truth of the matter is with a civilian oversight board a community oversight board you're talking about putting people on there that that don't know law correct they've never been in law enforcement\n... this is eleven members that are mostly citizens nominated\nBy local activist groups at that stage which means we're going to go to we're going to go to black lives matter antifa and all these other George Soros funded organizations that operate on a national scale not local\nAnd and ask them to give them subpoena power over our police officer ... officers that is insane mhm it it's just flat out in St all due respect as organizations for what they do the thought of that scares me to death\nWell here's what I fear Robert if by chance for whatever reason this passes if you vote yes for this you're going to has metro police officers leaving in droves at a time we can't afford it\nNot only that but this community oversight board is all this amendment allocate one point five million a year for this community oversight board one point five million\nThat could go out in the police department hiring more police officers\nThe community oversight group has already said their budgets not one for like five it's one point nine ... and you and I both know that government never operates on [laughter] so it's two million dollars what's that amounts to is ten million dollars over five years\nThat are living at it in a community on our side when there's already eight other levels\nPolicing our police mhm and you know we can take a step further and let me digress for a second before we come back to the rest of these amendments first off please vote no ... one yes I'll scream it from the rooftops if I have to but but let's talk about body cameras\nWhich is all part and parcel of the same or gas which we don't have yet well we allocate it Fifteen million dollars for body cameras\nAnd then we started researching this ...
