Harris and every other liberal out there because that's how it works in the U.S Senate you will be against the Trump Pence agenda and the people of Tennessee\nKnow what that means for them what the Trump Pence agenda means strong economy strong homeland security strong national defense more opportunities more money in your paycheck every week more\nMoney in your four one K. your retirement every month that's what has happened in Marsha Blackburn is going to be a person\nWho comes to Washington DC as a U.S senator\nTo support that Trump Pence agenda that difference here and we need to hold this seat because Tennessee is so important if we hold that seat which Marcia is going to win and then the Republicans have the opportunity to make gains in the U.S Senate and pick up anywhere between three and seven seats in a week from today\nAnd it's a very tough video proved it brought a similar to when he would go lock stock and barrel on every issue with the Democrats I mean if look there was ever a guy that could have run for the United States Senate as an independent it's Phil Bredesen he ran as a Democrat because he is a Democrat and if you listened beyond the ... you know the negative ads and all the games that are being played\nIssue by issue where he falls there is a clear difference there is a clear consequences and yes this Senate seat would be huge for the future of the president's ah let me just tell you something one week out and I know we got to get out we got to vote that's important\nOr what we see has to become a reality Tennessee is not going to let you down Corey uh again we're going to bring them or have\nThey never have and if you want to know how important Tennessee is\nTo this election cycle the president is coming to Chattanooga you know that right I haven't been there I've spoken in Hamilton County I have been there I was the keynote speaker last year or earlier this year the president's coming in the last four days of this election to make sure that the voters know how important it is to send Marsha Blackburn\nBack to Washington DC is a U.S and that is that you tell you everything you need to know because I don't ... don't forget not one Democrat in the country voted for Neil Gorsuch\nTo be a Supreme Court justice or Brett Kavanaugh actually one voted for Neal and one voted for a Brett but the point is not one voted for the Trump Pence tax cuts not once in a hyper partisan environment in Washington DC\nEven if a a Democrat is conservative back home they come to Washington and they're taken over by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren and they fall in lockstep with the party against the best interests of their own state and that's exactly what Phil will do I'm certain of it\nCorey Lewandowski is the twenty sixteen campaign manager for President Trump and are still a big part of a\nOf of a magical night that we live that I I tend to end all my discernment and all my feeling feel is coming again\nA despite what polling might suggest in in in races that are toss ups I Want to ask you a question um I ... I don't know where you were you were probably near the president I was at home and I have to admit to you up until about five ten pm central time I thought Hillary Clinton was going to be the next president and I was terrified\nBecause I knew she was going to be far more dangerous than even Brock Obama and we had already stretched the elasticity hub what are Republicans could withstand it certainly our economy\nUm but when I saw the exit polling and the exit polling suggested that there was a good portion of the American people that didn't really care for either candidate but they were breaking overwhelmingly towards Trump that's where that whole outsider comes in\nAnd the Democrats kind of did themselves then because Bernie would have been the outsider but they use superdelegates in a media\nOr to to rig the election and get the ultimate establishment candidate and I looked at my wife had five ten they said hey hold everything Andrea we got a shot based on that one fact\nMy question to you is we see the lack of enthusiasm and the great enthusiasm for the Republican voters we see the disparity in the early turnout and all that assumes that Democrats are voting Democrat like they didn't do twenty sixteen\nHas that partied gone so far left and there are dishonest voice in middle man the media gone so crazy and its tactics that they're about to backfire and shoot I mean Hillary even did a deplorable as to\nWhat was civility I mean I could go on and on this I I feel like Groundhog Day we're reliving twenty sixteen why would there was no be any different\n... it's not going to be different and when you look at what we call the A. B. E. V. quote so the absentee ballot in early voting in places I go to Florida specifically\nRight the Republicans are actually ahead in early voting in states that have it and that's a remarkable thing because by and large Republicans wait to vote on election day and so what we're seeing\nIs Republicans are turning out right now at numbers higher than the Democrats are the Democrats and now concerned about the Latino vote and the region that concerned about their Latino voters because under the Trump Administration there are more Hispanics working than ever in our nation's history there are more black people work in the\nThan ever in our nation's history the unemployment rate\nFor Asian Americans African Americans Hispanic Americans at the lowest ever recorded\nFor women were at a sixty five year high for employment and so it doesn't matter\nWho you are if you're a Republican or Democrat you weren't doing better today than you work two years ago and the Democrats haven't recognize that so they're running a play book of two years ago trying to instill fear\nSaying that we're a country for open borders or a country who wants to get rid of immigration and Customs Enforcement or country wants to put more government regulations on you and take more of your money that's what the party of the Democrats are running on\nAnd the people of Tennessee and across the country said no no\nWe send to change to Washington DC and twenty sixteen that change is actually working I've seen them my paycheck every week I'm going to continue to make sure that that was for it and that's what we're going to see an election I and it's going to be at the at the ... of the mainstream media wants to sell it or a worse way to see Trump ...\nThat's the next step after the first election because they were filled with the delusions have brand or that they were given by the\nYou know everybody goes into their tribe and they get their MSNBC news or CNN News they really thought they were going to one and then there's shock well how did this happen because they never had a realistic view oh had to be Russia and so they're crying having a tantrum not accepting the president's\nWhat are they going to do after this one this is we're actually fear for violence violence it's already beginning I mean we had a Republican you know I'm a a headquarters shot out yesterday nobody covers that do just to ... you're right and\nAnd look at the headline of the Washington Post on Saturday morning Trump supporter sense pipe bombs to Democrats is basically what it said okay it didn't say Bernie Sanders supporter or you know ... ...\nThat killed two hundred members of Congress right it didn't say lunatic left wing nut job goes into a synagogue and tried and killed and creates this massive massacre right it doesn't say that but that's because they have their own narrative\nAnd what the media has not realize is that the American people are smart they ... seat pass their lives and their fall through it and they're going to go to the ballot box and they're going to vote for people that are making their lives better and that's why we're going to be successful one week from Kate in the media is heads are going to explode\nI said after the election as much as I was a one of the greatest political nights of my life I must admit I did not think the president was going to win and I was so pleasantly wrong and it was one of the most of my my daughters and my son were there it was one of the most extraordinary evenings of my American Life\nUm but but I said that night and I say it today two years later the most significant thing that happened was not that Hillary lost not the Donald Trump won the most significant thing was we witnessed the death of journalism and that we're going to live with and the chaos of that we're going to live with\nA long after two terms of Donald Trump or continue with Corey Lewandowski who was the twenty sixth in campaign manager and it's a very specific question because if if there's one issue that has come up and spend the Caribbean and the borders are in somebody wanted me to ask you\nHow do you stay out of the trap on the immigration issue you know the big white guy rich guy living in the White House versus poor refugees who just need a safe place to go and want to live the American dream Hadiya ...\nAnd all that object and get to the real issue which is it's an issue of sovereignty law and order it's an issue of national financial security and yes it's an issue of homeland a national security as well\n...
