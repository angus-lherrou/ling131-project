people living in areas of the Florida Panhandle hit the hardest by hurricane Michael this week are in need of food and water and people who live in areas not affected by the hurricane or helping to provide it\nAnd they were looking at various options and talking it over in planning for it and you know they like to throw things our way and get my feedback and so on and so\nWe discuss further and I asked some questions and said now\nI'm you know here's some things you need to be thinking about when it comes to that home\nAnd they were asking for my feedback and as we thought about it the things that came out of the conversation where\nThey ... they were kind of a entertaining the idea of either building a house um that would be a custom home or just one that was already built in and they would just buy it kind of like a cookie cutter house there was already there versus a custom and then\nThey were like I don't know whether we just want it for us in some for some of our family to to go and visit or do we want to rent it out and have it be income generating\nAnd then they were talking about you know uh and throwing this my way should we pay cash for it do we have the money to just pay it right now or should we get a mortgage on it and then they were looking at different locations and what is the best location so that\nYou wouldn't know that the home would appreciate in value in one day they'd be able to either sell it or pass it on to their kids and and it would have grown significantly in value and then another thing they were concerned about is making sure that it was durable that was protected from any hurricane or storm or anything\nThat my comments way so I thought you know what\nThis would be a really good show for us to consider and just talk about the similarities between a\nFinancial house they were all building and we are going to live in in retirement and a home that we might have a you know like I've described\nAnd so let's go over the various aspects of what we talked about customer versus cookie cutter income versus a generating or not mortgage versus debt free locations so that it can appreciate and durable and protect as are the first one is\nA custom house he was looking at me saying you know what do you think I should do is going to take longer\nTo have them build custom house and I know that my wife and I are going to debate and we're going to argue and ... maybe it would just be easier to go into a house that's already built\nAnd when you think about your financial plan there are people out there all over a middle Tennessee that just to offer people kind of a candid approach to finances and then here deacon what we want to do is build custom\nFinancial homes for people I think that's so much better\nSo let me ask a question than a ... so we've all heard the phrase you get what you pay for now when it comes to retirement planning is it is it still the same if you were looking at obviously a custom home\nMore than likely you're going to pay more for a custom home than you are a cookie cutter like we said well it's not anything apply to to retirement planning\nIn theory it should and um you know uh to do good customer planning it probably is going to be just a little bit more but you know there's people out there we do analysis on people's portfolio all the time\nA and one they have no idea what they're paying but a lot of times they're paying for something that just came that they literally didn't even need to get promoted visor they could have just opened up a retail account at vanguard or or fidelity or TDY America trade or one of these places\nAnd just bought these mutual funds that are kind of a dime a dozen themselves and not even gone through an advisor and maybe even you know save some of the costs there so\nIt should stand to reason that the custom house\nWould be more but\nIt isn't always but in my opinion it's much much better especially for those that are in retirement we all know the value of eating whole foods\nFor best nutrition the same can be said for your retirement plan you want a holistic approach or full service wealth planning including the whole picture wealth taxes in the state they should involve the coordinated efforts of qualified financial accounting\nAnd legal professionals now is the time I Believe for folks to make sure that they have this

house in asking you is it an order do you have all the key components that make up a financial health and so a less segment we we came out we talked a little bit about the income generating and wanted to kind of go back and pick that conversation not because what it is in the questions I have would be what are the major sources of\nGenerate an income in when it comes to retirement plan\nWell I'd love to speak to that first second I'm sure John has some input or does this every day with people here but um you know there's always Social Security the question is\nHave you had somebody really work with you to show you the latest strategies and how to maximize that Social Security that's even more important now the tensions are going away but if you have a pension\nThere's rarely a week go by the I don't talk to someone that maybe has some little pensions from somewhere and they're trying to consider do I take it as a roll over and then I get control of that money or do I take the income guaranteed for the rest of my life\nAnd how you take that for for just one life for both lives jointly or there's a lot of things to consider or so and then we look at other things like dividend paying stocks or maybe even bank notes or income funds and those kinds of things that\nThe pay dividends dividends equal yield equals income and then it can even be income from something stable like an annuity of some kind of met with a man just this past week\nAnd he had had an annuity and now he and his wife are getting like sixteen hundred and Seventy one dollars\nMonth jointly for the rest of their life and so that's very very important for them and they know that they have income that even if they lived to be Ninety eight years old it's never going to go away so these are some of the income sources that we look\nFor and I just had one thing that I guess the question the other day um in fact it was about two weeks ago from a couple that came in and it was trying to make decisions about Social Security and they just decided to take\nA their Social Security and um they said you know you guys came to a seminar any kind of made a big deal about this and they said you know this to us this is pretty straightforward and you know what could really offer value here and so because they were born before Nineteen fifty four\nThey had an opportunity that they didn't understand didn't know was their\nRight to be able to take advantage of legally and was going to put literally thousands of dollars if they lived their life expectancy into their pockets that they were entitled to so if we had not taken the time to address Social Security which by the way we are not compensated for\nBut it still impacts their financial life so now as they make that decision they're going to make it was full knowledge of what their options are and not everyone has the same options that's why we make such a big deal about this and complaining it's not just the stuff we get compensated now and it's also the stuff that you're legally entitled to it but you got to have a plan and it goes\nBack to what you said first point right custom accustomed plan right accustomed plan is going to look at someone's income and really dissect that look at the different options instead of just going into like we said the cookie cutter plant so as we look at that costs much plan for someone's financial house we got income generating what's next\nYou know the question that was a race to me by this couple looking for my input and advice as their financial advisor was you know we do have moneys\nThat we could take out of accounts and pay everything right up front or we could carry some part of a mortgage and should we\nYou know go into the second home debt free or not and you know when you think about it um people going to retirement and many of them\nContinue to have debt in retirement and they're doing very very well\nBut I Would say that the strong majority of the people that we meet with really have a bias and I think with good reason\nTo is there a way for me to go into retirement\nAnd being debt free and I think that's a a huge win if you can it doesn't mean you can't retire if you're not but uh it certainly is something to aspire to and look for the opportunity because I'll tell you what if all you have is just monthly bills\nTo take care of yourself here in middle Tennessee it doesn't have to take that much money now you want some fun money to we always look at it like\nPaychecks and play checks the paychecks is the money coming in from various sources that cover the things we have to pay\nBut then the plate checks is the money left over that\nWe can actually reward ourselves for all those hard working years and um it's nice that what we have to have going out is as small as possible so we work with families every single week on strategies to get them to a position of strength which wouldn't be debt free in most cases\nSays he can return to strategies Vincent John you're ready to retire with confidence call right now\nSix one five three nine five three thousand that six one five\nThree nine five zero zero zero [noise]\nWasn't much bigger than the strategy has been missing John max and having Christie\nHere with you this morning thank you for joining us having a great conversation about financial house just looking at the different aspects of so much financial health really breaking that down and asking you the question is your financial house in order and if it's not what do you need to do what steps do you need to be taking over to to get there\nSo you don't want to go back you guys uh and speaking of financial houses you guys help in a lot of people in middle Tennessee figure out exactly if they're on track are not in the ...\nYou know lots of seminars besides being on the radio and TV and are you guys meet with people in person and groups of ten twenty thirty forty people is there any event you guys have coming up that the people listening could go ahead and signed up for this morning\nAbsolutely and before I tell these dates or the one thing I Want to throw in there and that we use this law and it's a cute little catchy phrase but it's so absolutely true and that is that information\nIs good but it's not good enough implementation is great and so we want to give people the information but we hope to act on it too so we have an estate planning lunch and learn right here at the cool springs office on October the thirty\nThe day before Halloween new eleven thirty were going to feed people are great lunch but better still Ryan night is going to share a state planning information and choices that folks are going to want to know and there's no cost for this but you do have to call six one five three nine five three thousand\nIncidentally if you come to that event that's one of the scariest days of the air for me do you know why pie I don't\nBecause you know I have small boys in the ... in the household my boys get to pick what I wear trick or treating and they're small but they're old enough to know that they like to embarrass their fathers I'll probably know and can announced the people that come with them having to dress up\nAs in my twelve year old\nHas assured me that uh there will be pictures and memories that I Will be the only one that doesn't enjoy so thanks for reminding me\nThat you know who you are to dress up for this state blame\nMitt practice ready to have a whole house about scaring people out of here [laughter] so then at spare he said oh that's a great restaurant the cool springs area\nWe're doing a seminar there on the twenty third and the thirtieth of October we're going to be talking about things like retirement income taxes market and economic risk if you'd like to come to that free of charge\nThe number is six one five three nine five three thousand you can enroll in that\nThat sounds great so it was picked up our conversation again before we move forward or to the other aspect of financial home I Want to go back and look at the appreciation and the growth\nWhat are some of those strategies that you recommend to your clients when they come in to as far as looking at their home to make sure they have all the check marks checked like you said earlier\nAbsolutely so when it comes to gross you want to make sure that your fees are as low as they possibly can because they eat into your growth\nThen you want to make sure that you're very diversified and uh you don't just have a vanilla flavor of two or three mutual funds or ATF but so you are well diversified in different sectors especially the ones that are leading right now that can help you the most and\nI Believe that having a managed portfolio where you have people watching it continually tastes\nAn advantage of the opportunities when there are not just buying and selling everyday but taken advantage of the opportunities when they're they're\nA that's huge and then even just making sure that you have the right allocation as far as like how much of your money should be in growth right now and at some point do you take some of those winnings off the table to provide you more income in retirement so those are just a few of the things that I Would say\nYeah I mean it's really about diversity of grow up to you want some that can be\nMore aggressive but more highly growth oriented but sometimes when people hear about grow they uh you know\nA certain level of risk and certainly any type of growth model in the market is going to have a higher degree of risk than money that's out of the market but I just wanted to say relatives to this issue of growth growth doesn't mean you take risk on everything\nThere are certain ways that you can have a conservative growth model where you actually believe it or not can have some things that are protected principle protected\n... here's what you need to be thinking about just to recap accustom house versus do I just want a cookie cutter that everybody has this the flavor of the week do I want it to be income generating how about your finances and retirement is that do you have a

surgery is going to go through and tried to trim off those ... well that doesn't fix the problem because again the problem is you have instability of the ligaments of your lumbar spine so what do\nYou hear first and foremost is we have to re approximate the bone so generally speaking when you stretch and Tara ligament and you're back to the bones have basically become separated it stretches ligaments so the first thing we do do do we need to move the bones closer to each other so that way the ligaments glue themselves back together well how do you do that\nWell she'll simple a chiropractic adjustment some people to come to that so dumb or don't believe in our project this some sort of a witchcraft well actually the opposite of witchcraft\nIt's actually a matter of fact the most common sense that you could possibly do if you move a vertebrate out a position in your back or do you need to move back in the right position yes and not only that but don't you need to be able to have an X ray or something to tell you is the boat in the wrong position and if I moved it is it in the right position\nAnd would it be great if you could just shoot an X ray you're back to see if there's a stability issue in the ligaments in your back\nBefore you started so that is what I Do that is why I'm actually a part of a group of holistic our project Nashville they have some of the

neck\nWas neck painted headaches and and I'm paying down to in your arm shoulders and hands\nBut we wanted stretching tearing these ligaments and what that causes instability when you're ... in stable that's going to or unstable it's going to cause your desk to ... to basically the the nucleus to ... to strip through that disk and that causes ... all kinds of bad stuff\nBut what it also causes your muscles to have to fire I'm inspired him to stabilize those further because the the ligaments can't do it so that the muscles have to do it and that causes your back to the soaring ATF particularly the end of the day it just feels really tired well if you don't do anything about this for long enough\nThat leads to arthritis again these vertebrae are unstable or grinding around your body doesn't want unstable vertebrae ... what is it do it lays down more bone and recall that arthritis arthritis has got to do with how old you are it only has to do with how old your injuries are\nJust have to do with your genetics and what your outlook like your grandpa looked like it only has to do with your specific injuries now and that's what causes arthritis right are you seeing how this all works\nAnd then of course that Saturday nervous that one we should we showed that stretch early am I going to go through the stretch again\nBut that can cause instability can cause the pitch of that

Y. S. they do a great job of promoting on all the little stock boards the message boards where people go and try to get advice which by the way that's the worst place to go get advice anybody [laughter]\n'cause you don't know who's given either by there you go out a little profile of someone who can event their own profile on line to Fifteen minutes to make themselves look like a multi billionaire investor and really they were just as Fifteen year old kid in the garage somewhere or if they're not getting paid by the company themselves a lot of times that happens to\nNow dry shift is famous now what what they do is they have a really good story there called a story stock and what they'll do is they move dry goods\nWorldwide okay chess writer so that's why it's called dry ships they moved to dry\nAnd so it seems like a novel concept well yeah that's pretty good I mean the big ships you see the big ships out in the water is gigantic tankers and all that yeah some of them is\nTheir stock is constantly being reverse split it okay so can\nYou explain what that is because that's something that confuses me so much\nOkay so are you a regular split as like when you buy a company and it splits two for one you hear about that every now and it's had a hundred years now you got to want to share yeah sounds good yeah of course the prices reflected on that so the two hundred shares is is like worth half the value of the hundred shares what's all the same\nAnd then but but confidence is high because why would they split the issue more shares if they weren't confident they were going to keep growing his right to make some parts of the exact opposite of having confidence that your company is going to grow\nIs having non confidence to company is going to grow and you have to keep shrinking the shares okay to make the companies seem viable in Asia more shareholders get more cash so we would have company issue shares\nThe company makes that money on once the shares are out there in the general public like let's say I I used to shares I make money at it gives me money on the company and an avid now has the shares right and then ... year so you Thomas I don't make any money on that they make the money back and forth okay yeah well dry ships what they've done is they've done something called reverse wedding\nAnd so let's say yet a hundred shares and they say we're going to give you three share Israeli hundred or or for your for what go seven for every seven years you have are going to give you one back so they take your seven and they give you one back to the stock price has to like sort well in theory it does it's bits supposedly were seven times more than ... because you have seven times less stock right right\nIt's one for seven to reverse what is the very next day it seems like they're issuing more shares the company selling more shares into the open market the looting of value widely done this over and\nOver and over again matter of fact in the last year they've done seven reversed with low one hour every twenty five years you have they give you one back twenty five to one reverse wet yeah which is the exact opposite of a twenty five to one good sweat right yeah\nAnd so and then right after that they issued enough shares out there they they the company printed more shares the printing press fired up\nAnd they diluted a share of age that they had to do another reversed with wild so because they've done so many river splits if you're holding one share right now it's equivalent to millions of shares if not billions of years back on the day when we went back into our\nFinancial high machine or get in there goes the door [laughter]\nCapacitor is overloaded outweigh the fact of the year\nTwo thousand seven All right okay\nAnd I don't remember what clothing styles was probably the same because we have on now and October two thousand seven if you had one share of dry ships back down to keep it might have done so many river splits you would never have won shared ... have been worth this but they've done some at a short one share was worse one point three eight six billion dollars my\nBillions of dollars yeah\nAnd so they've done so many river split city and and so that we see people keep piling more money in 'cause it sounds like a good company good stock company so that's what some people call their retirement plan that's a recipe for disaster so if you're one of the next ten callers hero I Want to make sure you don't make mistakes like this and get a true plan put together\nSo will create a one
