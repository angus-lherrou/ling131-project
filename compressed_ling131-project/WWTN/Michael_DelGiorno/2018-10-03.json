sixty three percent of all suicides in America from single parent homes and Seventy five percent of kids and chemical dependency hospitals are from single parent homes incarceration of miners eighty percent from single parent homes\nSo this is really driving a lot of the social economic issues that our country faces and so I thought once I get past this the the ... of everything I'm dealing with the urgency of\nThe drama I Want to create support for single parents and so\nI I called the solar parents society because I think the status of single parent is overused and if the weather's just becoming a there's the people that are still legally married that ... that's absolutely true and you know ... so I see single parenting as a status solo as a condition ... edition love and love the name loved the mission thank you\nThank you so we uh we develop resources we have a pod cast um\nWe build community support groups around the country or in Thirteen states now see I think that's everything right it is huge we have one at church to see that we ... we piloted there like two months ago and we were at capacity within the first week and it was never mentioned from the ... the need

and there's a reason why the Bible uses that word so suspicious specifically and so often\nEncourages when you're weak I can literally impart courage onto you for that\nAnd you realize the power of your society and the courage they're able to impart I might add also by the way you probably have men like you know a lot of women you know are going through and I don't know who does better when they're so low men or women I Would imagine that it really doesn't matter\nThey are they're each unique challenges a but there's gotta be so much encouragement just being around each other just it's huge ... you think you know when you get to the head of Marriage Act by the way\n[laughter] you know we have a lot of people that have met each other I was going to say and it's going to happen you realize it is they have so much in common I'm waiting\nFor you harm and he just wants or something but um yeah if you know just being together is is really the secret sauce because we don't feel as single parents like we fit in anywhere anymore the couple of groups that we used to be in the church that we used to go to we just we feel isolated and alone so if we can just ... you don't meet you don't meet the um\nCultural Christian visual model I think the church for a long time I I Know they care about single parents I just don't think they know what to do if they think you know if I if I Do something for single parents and my condoning divorce or something and it couldn't be further from the tradition of like a hospital treaty malaria\nBeing accused of you know endorsing malaria I

I I I kind of remember them being heavy this woman came out with two folk eggs\nWhy did he [laughter] it was like I've seen on a jars remember when they were doing the big barrel oh yeah and the thing kept going underwater with him and she literally had a cat guinea charm I don't know the I don't I don't want to be like them all evening maybe they weren't as heavy as I saw it but if I miss her name carry more than one at a time she was strapping young woman\nBut that you bring up Minneapolis that's what they were doing it but there was nothing as bad as this so yeah I'm just trying to get to New Orleans but I got to go to three places to get to know and right and so and there's always a layover and there's always the way and you know so but you it it would happen one of the three times\nI'm going to Dallas sometimes have been a jet and then sometimes you're like oh crap\nBecause you know you're at the gate oh now that has the stairway down to the ... oh and you're out with those little ... on the long run around with a guy that just got out of flight school\nIt was just one guy in there and he's like you know studying is notes looking at little little clip notes he put on his wrists\nYou ever fallen for this is my first man but I'm excited to your ear cliff notes but I mean you also know claustrophobic because you can't even stand up in those they're ... they're short there's only one or two seats on each side [laughter] and your ...\nDid you think\nThat the parents and even though it was even a propeller flights weather and she wasn't afraid\n\nPerry's sir I think it was all about claustrophobia she had a five hundred square foot apartment and it only had one door I don't think any claustrophobia issues are probably the most\nDamning thing is I mean you were somebody six years I well I Can't speak to Bruce Jenner is you know we went through that for those that weren't listening that's at o'clock hour\nBruce Jenner is sixty eight has a penis won the gold medal at the Capitol eat was on my ... cereal box as a kid now he wears address that peanuts claims he was a woman all along even though he's still has the pianist\nAnd apparently turns out to be a lesbian and a lesbian and get young lipstick hobbies because now his living partner is Sophia Hutchins Twenty one so in this crazy cultural political correct world we live in of really mental illness and spiritual disorder do refer\nTo as a lesbian I don't know\nI mean if he was a woman all along and stuck with a hairy chested happiness and ... is he a lesbian now because women like men usually Ninety nine and ... about Ninety eight percent of the time\nSo I mean I Can't figure all that out but you would think if you were with somebody six years there's only one person I've been with six years of my life and I'm married to her there's nothing Andrew doesn't know every dumb thing I've ever done dumb thing I've ever said every citizen I've committed she knows everything\n\nEvery story we know each other's story so much I have I call conversations with myself mhm I'm her and me and I do the whole conversation and she just sits there you know looking at a phone or plucking a chin hair\nAnd she allows me to do it because it's saving her breath in concentration every now and and you look up and go that's right that's what I said I Would have definitely said that I think I'm Glad I handled it well\nAll right so you're with a with a girl six years you know everything never in six years that you mentioned Brett Kavanaugh never in six years that you mentioned some traumatic assault that happened in high school\nAnd then oh by the way she coached or best lifelong friend Monica McLean at a polygraph for why is that a big deal crank it up\nDiscussions with anyone um besides your attorneys on how to take a polygraph nothing and I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that\nNow and it's scary that ... that while you're comfortable with that I can tell the information they'd have to address the or whatever it was ...
