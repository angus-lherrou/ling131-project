guess what happened that body works right right of course we always fine with it by the way of fertility this\nHow do we get talking with infertility Josh I don't know sometimes we just go we have we have a good time you're on the radio so with infertility we find there's generally a picture of going to the to the lumber spawn go into the female organs and there's also generally a picture of going to the high road those would be your stress hormones\nAnd it's interesting because you could imagine if you're a God designing your body and um you know in the period in the history of the world you know there's been times where\nYou know I'm particularly in the Bible you hear like Israel lives for their their nomadic so they're moving um you know they're very out of their position where they're they're they're just under attack rise are moving um they're ... if you will however I Do think that's going to be the time if you're under tons and tons of stress you're being chased by a\nYou know you know a conquering army do you think that's the time that that your body should get pregnant\nAnd that's you're probably not right so what do you think God will give you some failsafe that you

you kind of a double a double problem there and God Forbid you have stress in your life\nYour body's not going to be able to get pregnant because your body is basically saying if you're stressed out

I I said well there's many things that we help people with uh what is the one thing that you think more than anything else that concerns you going forward in your retirement which could last one needed Thirty years and hands down they looked at me and said\nThe amount of taxes that we're going to pay how can we know\nWhat we're gonna have to pay in taxes and when and how can we do anything about that\nWell one of the things that are my farm is done and and people ... capital have access to this\nWe developed a number of models reports ... basically look at the financial consequences of saving tax deferred which most people said today and four one K. plants in our race where they deduct but they put in but later on I have to pay tax on all the gain ... versus saving tax free ... in other words\nPaying your taxes up front but then letting everything grow tax free and there's an ad for what I like to do and are from ... to do is kinda quantify for people to financial consequences of either the from your taxes has traditionally money people\nOh on we're actually getting your tax out of the way the lower level early on and we think about it now you mentioned people could live twenty five thirty years out into the retirement\nIf you save tax to for what you're really saying is I Want to be paying taxes and all that money I take out for the rest of my life ... I Am exposed to changing tax rules changing tax laws for the rest of my life\nI Can't tell ... sitting here work taxes will go for next Thirty years but my bet would be higher and lower ... you've done through tax deferred savings because you've exposed yourself to tax risk for the rest of your life\nWell I Know you've said it before that uh we don't know what taxes are going to do they could surprise us and go lower into the future but\nMany people expect them to go higher but the one thing that we know is you know Fifteen Percent could become twenty twenty could become twenty five twenty five could become thirty five but zero is always zero so that I liked that don't you\nI I Love that and in fact what are we developed in our book and we'll be talking about and both of our book as well as\nThe reports that we are developed is really saying let's assume for the moment taxes stay the same which I think is probably the best case scenario mhm and one of the financial consequences of packs suffered for his tax free saving them we look at well what if\nTaxes go up now they could go down that is true running trillion dollar deficits forever now doesn't seem likely the taxes are going down but the betting is a safe assumption is taxes work best day level and probably will go up\nYeah and there's an opportunity right now with the tax reform act that went into place a there seems to be a a time period what is that the people if they're going to make some changes that could be impactful uh it it seems\nTo me that the the individual\nTaxes there's there's a sunset on that is going to end\nRight now people are saying that taxes are on sale ... are they rates went down on January first of this year\nHowever even the corporate tax rates are permanently reduced\nPersonal tax rates were called sunset in twenty twenty five ... and what that means quite simply the unless Congress acts\nThree scariest words in English language were left Congress X. rays will automatically revert to the last years right after twenty twenty five so we're in this kind of temporary period of lower tax rates and from then on who knows what's gonna happen\nYeah there is an opportunity again the phone number is six one five three nine five three thousand if you'd like to set up a meeting and talk about this a tax discussion with one of the advisors or tax professionals here at ...

know you just got a lot of experience that's what they say about me I'm the old guy here at beacon\nSo a founder and CEOs stone would financial ... Marty gets excited about and you can hear his passion is are helping you keep more of your hard earned money strategy so that you can pay less in taxes overall it's sometimes what that means is\nPaying a little bit more now so you can pay less later you know Marty I had a mentor early in my career and he said Pete in life you have two choices it wasn't just about money it was really about anything in general\nYou can either pay now and you get to play later or you play now but you're going to pay later so here's what I Know about our culture we live in a culture that for the most part\nImmediate gratification wouldn't you agree with that sort of immediate gratification so just telling me that I can save a hundred dollars less in taxes today I worry about the thousand I might have to pay later down the road I'm going to kick the can down the road because I don't want pain now I'll take\nPayne later and so um we don't think later will ever come but when it comes when in this subject is in return where for many people are living on a fixed income and now there's kicking themselves and they're saying\nWow why didn't I pay a little greater price earlier on so that now I could play more so it seems like the kinds of strategies that are in your books\nReally help people in the retirement years if they take action and if they apply the principals so that they can play in the season of life they deserve to play and wouldn't you say\nAbsolutely and you know it's not just taxes there's other issues going on I talk about my book for example okay hertz people get older\nThey cannot take as much risk you can't make up for losses the older you get you don't have that much time for it so you have to start shifting your money from riskier assets they have more potential for growth stocks into safer assets like fixed income investments and CDs things like that\nThe problem is in today's interest rate environment there's virtually no yield on dogs so another kind of tension I talk about in my book is\nHow do you kind of balance between oh I'd like to have growth but I don't want to take risks and oh I'd like to have safety but I don't get in return if what I call the savers dilemma that's another thing I dress in the book is how to overcome that dilemma\nWell the book the name is no compromise retirement plan our guest is Marty ruby and he's an

is good but implementation is great when you agree with that\nIt's absolutely K. and in fact one of my themes in the book is the longer you wait to take action\nThe more it's going to cost you yeah

IRAs and I asked people you know where the term four one K. come from and most of them don't actually four one K. is a section of the Internal Revenue code\nIt simply says if you're saving you know four one K. here the tax rules under four one K. the Internal Revenue code you're saving under\nSimilarly for higher rates section for a wait and so when you're sending in RA it says here of ...\nNow I point out my book that there's other ways to save for retirement other than the four hundred section\nAnd the one that I like the best is a section called Seventy seven oh two so people say what is Seventy seven oh two actually Seventy seven oh two of the Internal Revenue code is how life insurance is tax\nNow when I say life insurance I point this out in the book I say to people don't jump off off a roof you're that you're thinking about the old meaning of life insurance which is a pay a premium my kids get the death benefit I never see anything that's not what we're talking about here\nThere's a modern insurance product called index universal life\nThat qualifies under section Seventy seven oh two as a tax free way to accumulate money\nBut index universal life was designed by the insurance industry as a retirement savings tool it doesn't emphasize a big benefit rather emphasizes waves to accumulate cash that you use during your retirement years to generate tax free him come\nAnd that's the big difference between saving a kind of attack smart way versus attacks of away\nSo we're not talking here about trying to create the largest death benefit we're talking about trying to create tax free income is that what I understand\n... absolutely and and here Peter's what our models do again beacon has access to these to these models what we do is we analyze a person's tax deferred savings\nAnd we say if you continue in that tax deferred plan here are the implications in terms of taxes you're going to pay and the amount of income you could reasonably generate between now and some less than a a such as Ninety five\nWe've then compare that kind of under auction be too what if you took that money out of your ... today and we typically suggest over five year period\nPay the taxes on it and read a policy that money in a tax free index universal I policy and we project that forward and we look at what kind of income they don't produce and what kind of depth on the producers and the bottom line is we tell people just a lot of these two reports together\nAnd elected numbers do the talking you decide if you like the result under staying where you are today in tax deferred or the idea of moving some of your assets over and uh tax free and just look at the numbers and you decide which ones are better for you\nSo if you'd love to get a copy of Marty's book the no compromise retirement plan we want to give you that book you don't have to wait till it comes on Amazon will give it to you were handed to you um and we will have it signed by Marty and we will do that tax\nAnalysis based on his software that will show\nA exactly what you're going to need to pay in taxes and does it make sense to just kick the can further down the road or do something else if you'd like to have forward looking tax strategies give us a call me was one of the advisors here six one five three nine five three thousand you know to make\nThings changed in your plan you have to take action so don't just sit\nThere and do just think about it and say that sounds good pick up the phone give us a call six one five\nThree nine five three thousand well it's been a pleasure having Marty on the show we hope that this has been helpful to you our time is up for this week well hope you had as much fun listening as we did sharing our thoughts with you feel free to give us a call anytime six one five three nine five three thousand\nGo to ask me can now dot com or here's another one beacons C.

healthy and well without drugs without surgery starts with a God does on the first place so\nThat would be and said let's talk about this site addict stretch what is this ... nerve so you're saying nervous basically made up of the lower oh four or five nerves in your lumbar ... and these nerves come together and they created a big bundle of nerves that comes down to your leg and it's called the ...\nNerve right in that big side of nerve goes down there well you've also got a muscle called your purer form of muscle your performance mussels a bagel muscle\nIt's about the size of a sausage\nUm and it's big around Ron ... cheek and um that sad if nerve goes deep to pure form of muscle and goes down your leg well problem is when you're ... you're pure form of muscle get spasm gets gets tight and winds up smashing on that site addict nerve\nAnd that a pure form of muscle wind up getting basically tight and ... from sitting all day long believe it or not so when you sit you externally rotate your leg basically that means you're you're like how flops over what that does that shortens your ... your pure form of a muscle\nAnd then when you go to stand up and walk now that pure form of muscle is tight and it's mad and it pushes on that side of nerve and shoots pain all the way down your leg we know that a lot of people have this problem they get out of a chair or maybe you're driving for a long time and you get out of your um\nYour seat your your car seat of your truck seat\nAnd you stand up and it's like oh my gosh it's like there's like a it's really big pain in your butt cheek\nAnd you go to walk and you've got to like walk for you know like five ten Fifteen steps before this loose comes up enough that you can even walking move and it's real simple why that happens 'cause that that pure form of muscle is is tight and it's fast can smash into that performance nerve\nFeeling completely better she moves great life is good she's able to go back to exercise and work and sit in a car no stabbing pain\nDespite the ghetto booty by the way it's all good yeah I Love it\nUm and it's all better listen if you're like standing and and you've had some of these old

system we shoot X rays we didn't find the problem we just you\nThen we have like a ... in the house\nYou know treatment protocol who we we strengthen the muscles we loosened ligaments we we we re strength back down which shows and stuff do at home because it's an incredible\nIncredible things are expensive you'll love it but if you want to if you want the deal the century made right now exam ... normally two hundred fifty dollars but if you call in right now and again but it was only five minutes left with a show called and right now we do exam competition full set of X rays and a first adjustment all for forty\nDollars guys if you've been thinking about this\nUm if this makes sense to you and you're curious now is the time do not hesitate that number is six one five six zero six one

years six one two three three\nSo I'm again if you if you share that and you take advantage of about four minutes left um I'll give you the number again here before we're done but you definitely need to do that now so as we talked about the mechanics of the lumbar spy the number one reason people to have low back pain is because we've had these old injuries where we wind up stretching and tearing the ligaments in her lumbar spine\nAnd by the way the same is true for your neck\nWas neck painted headaches and and I'm paying down to it in your arm shoulders and hands but we wanted stretching tearing these ligaments and what that causes instability when you're ... in stable that's going to or unstable it's going to cause your disc\nTo ... to basically to the nucleus to to strip through that disk and that causes ... all kinds of bad stuff\nBut what it also does cause your muscles to have to fire I'm inspired him to stabilize those forever because the the ligaments can't do it so the the muscles have to do it and that causes your ... or an ATM particularly the end of the day it just feels really tired\nWell if you don't do anything about this for long enough that leads to arthritis again these vertebrae were unstable or grinding around your body doesn't want unstable ... what is it do it lays down more bone and recall that arthritis arthritis has to do with how old you are it only has to do with how old your injuries are\nJust have to do with your genetics and what your dad look like your grandpa looked like it only has to do with your specific injuries\nNow and that's what causes arthritis right are you seeing how this all works\nAnd then of course that Sadek nervous at one we should we showed that stretch early am I going to go through the stretch again\nBut that can cause instability can cause the picture that nerve and it causes that that your pelvis to not work correctly which shoots paying all the way down you're citing her down your leg just listen to that is that that's the nitty gritty of the low back if not much more complicated than that it's not worth it\nIn that it's not rocket science fiction and guess what is not expensive

is a lot of people were participating\nThey're putting money in every paycheck but they really don't know what allocation of sweat and they don't know if this election is they have a good and they don't know the hidden fees that exist in there and by the way folks are a lot of hidden fees and a four one K. where they wouldn't be pushes or we can analyze that forty gets you right on track and go according to go through a Quarterly Review process with your selections\nAnd then make sure that when it comes time to make sure that four one K. now turns into a tree retirement plan that income we can help you with that as well but the first step is to get a financial and retirement review looking up the road you're on right now the path you're going down and we take a GPS satellite view making sure that the road you're on right now will get you to the true destination you think you're going to\nAnd you'd be amazed how many people are way off course\nAnd it made every year with their advisory advisor tells them everything's fine Marty why did they tell them that\nThey went through that money a place that's why we stress the folks who come in and get out of malice just until we put an Eighteen page report together\nAnd it is the best of luck in opinion that you ever did on your investment account we look at these we looked at expenses and we look at risk adjusted return Jeff arm are returns where they should be commensurate with amount of risk that I'm taking which is crucial and that's where we call it the personalized plant\nSo we take those Eighteen pages and we consolidate I'm right down to one page plenty to review interviewer radio listener right now and you have at least four hundred thousand dollars save for retirement this review will be for you or strategies do work best but those have you with over a million dollars but as long as you have at least four hundred thousand or so safe retirement and in Fort Wayne caves or not you're home you're\nHome you're not going to sell your home and we have in the streets in retirement but anything but real estate like that is in court right now if you have rental real estate that can be included in that because a lot of times when people get older they want to transition out of the real estate and into a safe investment that will grow it'll give them protection it'll give them income for the rest of their life\nAnd if you have rental real estate it all depends you only get into someone's paying your rent you know what I write so we'll we'll put all that together for you if you're one of the next twenty dollars right now and Marty the most important thing is they'll have their own customized income plant folks you have your own income plan if you call right now that you'll be confident in and it'll be true again it'll have gross\nIncome and protection all built in ... triple play the positive triple play in the financial world but what Marty talked about the most important part of the whole Eighteen page plan\nIs we give your own personal lives and customize calculated risk exposure level as it currently exist now based on the risk you're taking right now in the market what would happen if it went the wrong way what would a duty your portfolio and if the market keeps going up what would be on the positive side so we'll wait a positive worse than negatives the secret every time it is to get that curve down\nSo if the market goes down you don't lose much if any of your retirement money now there's nothing wrong with taking risk but don't do it with money you're going to need\nAll the way through retirement we can show your own calculated risk exposure level as well as your very own income plan which we call turning a financial plan into a true\nRetirement

that will be out we'll talk about that but it's just going to be fun I'm going to work there for a day\nEarly omit yeah although very cool and then they're going to interview me that well it was quote unquote working there and a belt my experiences with blockbuster in the past you know I think he would blockbuster all the time was when you returned to take\nWhen you go up to their box out there you throw it in the box right now we had no yeah no proof that you put the take back into by right right yeah no I bought it with all their mailbox you know drive up and throw it in there and then it's up to them to say you really turned it back and if not sort of like uh you ever had never library books back into\nCheck a book out and they have to do overdue by you maybe forgot to turn it back you know summer so they they sent you a bill for like fifty dollars typically costs twenty [laughter] so that's what they did with his videotapes do if if you didn't turn it back in you know a lot of money yeah\nAnd there was no recourse I mean you know you had no way of ... so it was it was a he said she said that I have to be very careful on that so anyway that I thought I'd share that because we're we're positive about these movies and I've won a couple of days before because of uh you're inviting people out there like Peter to your mind is\nOne of the three guys behind space sex\nAnd
