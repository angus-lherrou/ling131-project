human experience in America this has been going on since time began the concept of truth and truthful witness in relationship to one another ever since the moment there been to people\nAn earth we've had this question about who's telling the truth\nAnd then the human race is always decided that the truth is better than the Y.\nUnless you're in the Senate Judiciary committee the matter anymore because Dr Ford served a purpose\nAnd now she's going but what about her true\nSo Renee seat does exactly the same thing or close to the same thing that the illegitimate\nSenate Democrats did in the Judiciary Committee they permit a witness to come forward whose testimony is impossible to substantiate and then they treat those claims as credible they defend those claims they applaud those claims and they totally defame another person\n\nAnd they don't care about the consequence because it's sort of a political purpose now Jim or an AC a Republican is doing exactly the same thing bringing forth claims bringing folks charges\nThat cannot be substantiated they're both wrong if you don't have enough proof so that honest people can make a decision on the truth then shot up\n\nDon't bring

that human person of value and worth\nBecause whatever happened to her is important but what's more important is her integrity and her house\nYou can't use people at the gym or an AC can't do it as Republican running for the said Diane fans Feinstein can't do it and no body in the American media\nIs holding the Senate Judiciary committee responsible for their illegitimate use of a false witness a witness who could not be proven true even close to a reasonable doubt\nThey'd just used her for the story they used it for the headline used it for the sensation used for the moment\n\nAnd I don't care what the Republican or Democrat whether you're running for the Senate in Ohio where the wrist energy district is wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong\nNow what's interesting to me is I applaud Sherrod Brown for having the courage to say to a gym raised Renee she put up or shut up if you don't have the evidence and you can't prove the truth then we're gonna shut you down\nBut see when the Democrat doesn't that just fine you imagine if the Republicans to try to do that in regards to Dr Ford\n\nWe've got two sets of evidence that are completely unsubstantiated how is the truth is one thing for

one so I happened to come in and help\nMichael and Dan and anybody else we can get through all the events last time so let's talk about this election that's coming up and there's a pattern going on around the country\nNow you may or may not be privileged all the information you may not have the time to get it all realized we're all very very busy\nAnd being busy as a challenge because being busy it keeps us away from sometimes the stuff that matters that's even more important than a nagging stuff we've got to do every single day taking care of our civil government has a responsibility used to be a primary responsibility in our country\nA but we got pretty busy and success in a lifestyle progress\nHas put us on a situation where we've got a lot more boxes to fill a lot more duties a lot more responsibilities and so taking the time to care about our civil government it's sort of falling down the list of priorities so we get to an election\nWe try to catch up with the best of intentions and do the right thing and we get all the planes coming at us and all the personalities coming out and all the media coming yes how do you discern what's going on a one way you can discern in a situation like the control of the United States Senate electing senators is to consider\nOur history to consider the history of the candidates to consider what's going on around the country and what we find one of the house or the Senate congressional races this year there is a pattern\nPart of the pattern is that the Democrats have been using the courts to cancel out\nA districts and to use judicial power for redistricting congressional districts so they've been able to bump out some of their opponents and change their districts\nAre set those opponents it's severe disadvantage that race up there in Pennsylvania everybody heard for a brief period about this guy Conor Lamb and how we want a special election and that was supposed to be the beginning of the blue wave\nWell through using the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania the Democrats also turned around and made that district that he wanted a special election disappear\nAnd they're looking air Clarksville, Tennessee Montgomery County surrounding areas and thing they're going on the ground to ask people why aren't you go to why isn't it important to you and to hear the answer is no response is I think some people were taking a big ...\nLook at it doesn't matter to me and others are saying it doesn't impact my everyday life so I and unfortunately I think in both cases um there are sadly mistaken it does impact your everyday life and it does matter to\nRob judge me on this one I I um I've watched the methodology of this particular article and I don't disagree with their conclusions uh I mean our office here in Tennessee\nIs south of town and I have seen in Williamson county I'm In some primary elections a voter turnout of somewhere between three and eight percent\nShia tagged Henri ... questioning the fact that\nThere is a question about voter participation in the south in particular state of Tennessee\nBut in the numerology if you will in the statistical way that they put together these numbers they take the people who vote and divided them into the amount of eligible voters by age [noise] not by registration and that's a different methodology I think it's interesting and compelling what do you think of that\n[laughter] well it is an interesting methodology but let's remember too that is how somewhat very similarly that is how representation\nFor all of us is the term in the United States Congress it's not determined by um citizens of the United states has not determined by registered voters it's determined by the number of bodies\nIn the district it averages out to about seven hundred and ten thousand people per each district so I'm for this article to take somewhat of a similar approach the only difference there saying people over the age of Eighteen that are eligible to vote I think that's a dangerous way to look at it because you don't know if some of those people are even\nEligible to vote and could they vote legally\nWhile you took that to a whole nother level on me let me let me just break that down for a second I if I heard you right\nBasically the way that they view this is the way that we set up congressional districts how many adult bodies are in\nA a region and you've got to a congressional district makes up about seven hundred thousand people so he got foreign and bread five of those but if you get counted in that district even if you're as an adult even if you're a non citizen discount started representation\nYes and they count people under Eighteen as well for congressional representation but yes that's why you see such growth in states like Texas and Florida California and house districts because they're counting number of bodies not number of citizens and then you have other states such as Ohio\nAnd I wasn't planning on going there and at that every time I hear that it kinda messes me up to realize that and I think I don't think a lot of people realize that the congressional districts are made up of the number of bodies not the number is to distance\nYes residents because it's based on fences number when they take census data they don't ask you are you a citizen they just want to know who's living there and how many people were living\nOn us that he was born citizens are in essence a part of the representation of formula of our Congress\nYes they are and then citizens then lose representation or a formula because others are counted so that's why there's more representation in places such as four\n... four known call All right that's good to have that up okay now I Want to come back to you and ask you some other questions I Want to go over some of these specific objections that are listed from the good folks in Clarksville by the way from Clarksville according to the to the to the new out to the Washington Post you are
