right direction\n[noise] so you wouldn't think that the ... to ... we saw the enthusiasm numbers leaning right and we saw the early voters leaning right so everything points to\nYou know what the heck is a likely voter first of all throw it any pulled that isn't a likely voter because a popularity contest to people that aren't gonna show up and vote is irrelevant\nBut even likely voters in a midterm election have turnout issues\nSo whereas the enthusiasm whereas the early ... vote voting pointing so I I can give you enough skepticism but if this were accurate if Reuters would suddenly the first accurate poll six days before election what does it showing well shown Bill Nelson now leading by five points\nAnd the margin of error is four percent\nSo it's a very close race and it's definitely leaning dolphins way and a lot of people are writers for sure would speculate and that may explain why Gilliam the Tallahassee mare\nPotentially the first black governor of the state of Florida now has showed support of fifty percent of likely voters\nTo forty four percent for Ron dissent is now again I only debate say they got one poll Reuters that's why I kind of like real clear politics 'cause you can see everybody now there is a consistent picture in fact only WC TVs poll at the Sanford is leading by three now\nThe bay news nine poll has Gilliam by seven Florida Atlantic University is Gillian but for the St Pete poll has Gillian by one\nA grab a civilian by five of us has a Gilliam it's sick CBS poll has Gillian by one New York times is Gillian by five USA Today has Gillian by one and the real clear politics average is Gillian by three\nAnd so it's within the margin of error and so it's a very close whereas if we go to the Senate race\nYou get a little bit of a different picture\nSo in all of those no citizen late well he's leading by two with USA Today leading by one with the UN a fleeting by four with the New York times in a tie by CBS\nGrab it says Nelson by for St Pete as Scott by one see t._v. is Nelson by one Florida Atlantic University of Scott by one the two biggest extremes is the main news nine poll that has Nelson by eight\nAnd really the New York times is Nelson by four versus everybody else as a one or two are tied\nSo I mean you know when I look at this particular I yes Florida as a bellwether yes it's the east coast it's going to be the earliest returns we get and if we start the evening off\nAnd Gilliam is headed for the governor's mansion and Nelson's headed to the United States Senate and Rick Scott has failed that might get chip Parker it up a little bit on what's to come because tops the tickets content to drag everything below with them and those house races become extremely important\nUh but it all presumes that polls are accurate and it all presumes that likely voters will vote went enthusiasm trending momentum issues an early voting\nShows at a the Republicans are out numbering there's more enthusiasm and more turnout why Obama's added to Florida and trust\nAnd when those genes are broke it and get a hereditary trade Dr Douglas ... says patients are increased risk for cancer genetic testing can help unravel
