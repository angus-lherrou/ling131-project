Robinson who committed adultery like every ... minister\n\nAbandoned his wife and his children name not a sinner on worthy of leadership but praised in elevated the bishop because it was a gay relationship\nPresiding over the internment of Matthew Shepard who was not killed for being gay it was drug related greed related in fact he was a method to he didn't even said that he met one of them ... the guy that killed dummy knew\n\nWhether it's fair to say Matthew Shepard was gay\n\nAnd that Aaron I think it was Aaron Hernandez no jamon is no Aaron mechanic I'm Sorry Aaron McKinney who killed\nAnd ah\nMatthew Shepard was bisexual for sure or gay and I know each other wasn't to strangers targeting them for being gay took him out beat them burned them and left him tied to a fence\nHe got in the car with them left a gay bar gotten the car with him because he knew the one and it was far more drug influenced and far more about robbery\nRobbery gone bad and that's the court case\n\nAnd he will forever be this simple symbol that's a lie\n\nAnd anybody with a cup PT yeah Google will show you that or you'll find hundreds and hundreds of stories from dishonest

to do a book all about this hate crime only to find it nothing to do with hate nothing to do with being gay they were both gay\n\nAnd you know you have one year like Nineteen eighty seven member Nineteen eighty seven October Nineteen\nEighty seven black Monday yeah exactly the market that what that was a thirty percent decline and yet people don't remember that the market actually ended up five percent that year now so you can have big downturns inside of a course of the year when news comes out\nBecause you know Ninety six percent of games in the market historically have occurred since because of point nine percent of trading days and you know markets were very very fast and if Newt you know like get was just talking about he said you know what what caused the market to go up today so far as loved the news you know\nTalking about having a meeting with a Chinese leader and saying hey maybe we can get some of these trade issues worked out but there there is a lot more going on\nJust trade well let's start let's start right there a first of all if trade issues caused enough turned up right now it's at three or four on the\nUh after we lost what was it eight fifty the day before and five forty six yesterday\nUh that that kind of gives you a perspective that it wasn't that much about China so to the president's point and probably more realistic point the feds involvement and the raising of interest rates\nTo try to try to blunt inflation that seems to be one of the driving forces of this particular do\nYou know with the interest rates and people ask me well why do interest rates matter that much and of course when we're dealing with companies they borrow money and one of the cost of running a company is that borrowing costs and that affects earnings and then you can have a blending on earnings for for a little bit but you know here's the reality\nThat I get from that but that would cause what exact ended up being about twelve hundred ...\nYeah yeah you can have that and you know right when we're talking about trade for example you know people are saying well our supply chain has disrupted as a result of this well you know that takes time you know if you look at it you've heard me say this before Michael if you go back to Nineteen forty six till now when you have a market down turn on average it takes a hundred and eleven days for the market to recover from the downturn\nWell that's an average sometimes it takes longer sometimes it takes less time and when you're dealing with things like ... maybe interest rates or trade\nOr those types of issues if you're running a company or let's say you're the c._e._o. the company or you're the board of directors or you're in leadership and the company\nIt takes a while to do the things that are going to bring profitability back it may take a while may take very very short period of time they just take a brand new piece of news that says hey things aren't nearly as bad as we thought they were going to be\nOr it could take a little bit of a while\nBut on average it doesn't take that long for markets to recover but why ... when might it take a little bit more time\nWell let's say that you're dealing with a company and all of a sudden your demand for your goods and and your your products are lower\nWell now you've got to stop ordering things and I'll take a while before your current orders\nAre run down their their course and then you know you got to lay off people I was teaching a workshop last night and one of the people in there was an HR person and I says you know if you had to lay off people at your company was it immediate was your costs or your costs productions immediate you know absolutely not you know since ... takes a little while\nI you're going to revealing for asking this question but the truth of the matter is\nIn the last two years it hasn't been a hundred and eleven days I mean and it won't I suspect it won't be a hundred and eleven days before we're back into the twenty six thousand five hundred range\nOr so the recoveries happen quicker though that's relevant I understand uh there are averages and we look at things in the long run just like we say I'm really not down Fifteen thousand unless I sold 'em and so it's on it's it's important to understand what's happening if that keeps people from doing things that are permitted and stupid\nUm but these are things that happen constantly these are things you know the the correct to build things to correct their average period of time but they had been correcting quicker than that I mean we I I think if you look at the last two years things have corrected quicker than a hundred and eleven day average\nYeah good good memory you're you're exactly right I remember\nEven when we had a longer term period of time when the market was down you know back in oh wait I was teaching this that was his workshop and I said you know let's take a walk down memory lane because I like to point out how back in those days that that was a tough time for me in my business I was going on T. V. doing radio shows and interviews and so on so forth\nAnd into eight no nine\nYou you couldn't find anybody that was optimistic about the market I remember you know one guy from a major major TV program saying please if you need your money back in five years you know please don't have your money in the market and he was just saying this is going to go on and on and I pointed out to my group last night I says you know if you listen to him five years\nLater oh I'd love to hear that five hundred was up up thirty percent you missed out on thirty percent return having listened to that advice and where was that guy and there was another [laughter] ... exactly what a lot of investment\nFirms do you know Mrs Jones let's just put this on the sidelines or wait for the market to get better from is when news comes out and Michael you've seen this when news comes out it it it instantly in markets and they go up and it's too late for you to get back in\nYou know it's like we can't sit there and watch and go hey when things look better because when things look better the people that currently own those stocks already and they know the things that are better as well and they won't they won't let you buy the stuff off of them for the old low price anymore\nSo that's the challenge is you're trying to figure out where the thing is going to go and you know you don't know in markets move very very rapidly\nUh the dark closed down five hundred and forty six for another big drop eight thirty to the day earlier today it seems to be rebounding over the news of a China us conversation and some at 'em and but it's up three hundred today we're talking with Paul Winkler is there a teachable moment in this week alone\nI I think these teachable moments are very repetitive but most people follow the news um you know I think I can take you back from my management years and we would do research do you know were tested the last\nIn terms of what listeners wanted to hear always financial news\nEvery talk station ... every talk station the world is doing the wall\nStreet Journal report and nobody cares really um and so when we hear stories like this and I think it's very by five maybe it's the top six story\nThe Dow falling and you'll hear things about the president commenting on the fed being too aggressive with interest rates are you'll hear scares about uh you know Chinese a trade negotiations I don't think the average person no I mean they hear that and they move\nOn but they don't really understand it until somebody like you really breaks it down and you're like oh because this is what this what your reaction is oh wow that makes a great sense I just I just nobody ever explain it to me or I didn't know the terminology so I really wanted more than anything else to use this week is a teachable moment what is that teachable moment again\nI think there are a couple of things I think one of the things that we find is that investors are too they are too exposed to the doubt\nYou know if you look at the Dow just thirty companies and if you look at the Dow in terms of what those companies representing the S. and P. five hundred five hundred biggest companies in the United states it's forty percent the value of those thirty companies is forty percent of the S. and P. five hundred so\nYou think about it wouldn't affect those comes in and you know if you look at it well diversified portfolio globally diversified like you know what I Would use the Dow stocks are only two percent\nOf such a portfolio that's number one if if you're watching the market in your portfolio is moving right with the Dow you got a problem you know there are years when the Dow does better and everything there years most of the years in the past fifth Eighteen years large us stocks have only been the best ethic category for one of those Eighteen years\nAnd one didn't we didn't we have this conversation at at the event the other night in the um for me and and you would know your rent within your yeah doing the best you can advocate within these are programs but I ... I can have the dial up three hundred points and see very little\nI can have the NASDAQ go down\nYou know eighty and all of a sudden I notice it down and that so I mean I I don't know I think you're right and that will remember when we used to always kick around\nI think even the unemployment numbers can be a somewhat of a worthless number and I've always argued that because it doesn't address who's left the workforce or doesn't address people that are under employed what does that mean well I lost my three hundred thousand dollar your job but I'm not working up a chick fillet\nWell you're not the same person with the same economic impact so I mean we put too much emphasis on the unemployment number doesn't tell us the whole picture and we put way too much on the dial in fact you'll notice if you start tracking it it really doesn't add up with your Ross IRA or your four oh one K.\nWhat you'll you bring this up this is an interesting point because right now we're in a political season and all of the politicians are saying hey look look how we're doing for the economy and they're saying look at how what the Dow is down and look what your\nFour one K. is done and I kind of shake my head and go no they're not necessarily attached to each other you can have it a lousy economy believe in ...\nGreat stock market you know we had a lousy economy in two thousand nine two thousand tend to have an eleven but it was a phenomenal stock market and you can have a great economy but the markets not doing much of it then they're not attached and too many times politicians put them together like that\nNow the other teachable moment let me just hit this I saw this study one of my guys point of this study out to me and I thought that's phenomenal and he was looking at this
