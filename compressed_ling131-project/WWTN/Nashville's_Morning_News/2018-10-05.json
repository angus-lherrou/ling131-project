good I think ah Mitch McConnell yesterday said he felt pretty good about it and generally he's got the inside track on this stuff\nBut I don't think anybody knows until that vote is taken if the if the cloture vote goes into get at least fifty votes vice president and breaks the tie things off dead center that's probably a pretty good sign that the other but we'll go well but not a guarantee\nBecause sometimes people will vote with closure to dispose of the matter one way or the other and they're they're not really committed to supporting the vote when it comes to the floor for
