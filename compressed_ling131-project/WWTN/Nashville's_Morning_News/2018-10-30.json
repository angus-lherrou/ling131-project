unfortunately sometimes they'll tell one group one thing and they'll tell another group or another and I don't know how they think that we're not going to notice that because we always do\nSo the question has been ask of ... of Nashville's dynamic mayor oh he's a he's a man he is he's a dynamic guy he's like Batman this guy ah he's like the dynamic duo now a mayor Riley a\nHas been they've been trying to find out where are you on this community oversight board\nThat will look into the actions of the police try it's amendment one on the ballot right now I I have a feeling it you know with a hundred and twenty two thousand people in Davidson county already voting this may already be decided but but if it isn't and you haven't made up your mind let's just talk about it for a moment\nDavid broadly as ask okay are you for this idea that this community oversight board and he has been ... you never really hear him say it but his people will tell you know he does not support the language as written and amendment one\nHe's not necessarily against the idea of community oversight but he doesn't live amendment want that's what he says when you when their spokesman is asked the question\nAgain spokesperson speaking for it I don't think I've ever heard him out of those words but you know then he was he was having this event or over at the Watson grove Baptist church a for a meeting of Nash billions organized for action and hope they call themselves Noah\nAnd and this is what he said about the community oversight board and how people should vote\nIsn't money in terms of the oil and more\n... than Israeli allies\nAre driving while black you said read it and rely upon when making\nYour decision driving while black as a as a I I Would have say a controversial study done in twenty Seventeen and which it talks about how black drivers are disproportionally stopped by police\nThat's that's oversight um\nBut but what was being proposed here an amendment one is something that I think is going to be very bad for this community\nBecause you're going to set up a an oversight board that will look at all police ... activities through a couple of different lenses a couple of different prisms one will be a you know up the the racial profile limbs\nUh and and the racial lands and the other one's going to be you know the um the political Lynch\nPolitics and race relations\nAre important but you ought not be looking at every decision that has made by a police officer through those particular lenses you ought to be looking about whether or not there was a legitimate reason to stop a person a legitimate reason for the police to take action if they felt like they needed to take action\nOr if there was an application of deadly force was it reasonable and was there were a threat against a police officer or against others these I mean these are facts that they really should race should not enter into it\nUh it really should we ought to be colorblind when it comes to how we enforce the law and and you are you are you saying that well there are a lot of black people get pulled over is there a reason for that\nI you know I I if you if you say there is absolutely no reason that maybe we do have a problem but I don't think that's the case I think police officers pull over people in areas where there are as high crime\nThat's the bottom line\nSo look it's a delicate thing I understand the mayor's has to has to run for reelection and metro Nashville and I get that but but but that same token we ought to be making decisions based on whether or not the police officer made the right decision\nDid he have probable cause for the stop was his application of force appropriate to the situation all of these things are are are going to be decisions that we can that have nothing to do with racial politics but unfortunately with the community oversight board it will be all about that\nAnd not about whether or not the proper action was taken I don't\nLike this idea I think it's going to put police officers are having to defend decisions they made in a matter of middle of seconds before a board that can look after your actions with perfect hindsight's twenty twenty\nThey got all the time in the world to deconstruct what that officer on the front line had to decide in a matter of less than a second\nWow what'd you want to work in an environment like that where every single decision that you made under pressure was deconstructed and analyzed I mean you had to make a snap decision\nAnd and you had to do what you thought was right for the community and for yourself to protect your own life and in some cases\nWould you want to have those kinds of decisions analyze endlessly\nBy a community oversight board that cares about two things politics and race I don't think you would I don't think you would and I think that what what would be the end result of this if we're going to lose a lot of uh really qualify\nBut officers they all say I'm not here I'm not I'm not doing this if I have to worry about every single decision that I make being reviewed by a committee oversight board with a one point five million dollar budget and analyst who are going to be digging through all these reports to find things to do because well they have to justify their existence\nThat's not what you that's not the solution\nYou want some

to George Solomon funding it\nAnd we need to fight fire with fire people at the rally Trump rally need to have pepper spray on them while Oh absolutely we are in war I just saw\nA picture of the other day of people in than what the panel that believe isolate on Cal and they are absolutely being kept coming out of a Trump rally they they're grown so no war it's more\n... listen thank you I you know I'm I'm feeling a little\nSensitive about this issue because I went to the the black rinsing on Sunday and and\nWas actually trying to be very polite to an elderly woman in a wheelchair I got a water and I got her cookies\nAnd turned out she was one of the protesters I gave a protester of cooking and it still bothers me Sarah out on the road this morning watch what should we do should we fight fire with fire or should we be the better people and and and turned the cheek and try to be nice\nWell I feel like we need to try to be a better person but I also feel like\nWell I Will be an attack I mean I Would press charges against those people well you know what it\nBut when people start talking about oh you know racial injustice or they start talking about X Y or Z way be like hey you know have a conversation about this you know I Know some people aren't going to have conversations but we're not gonna be able to change everybody but one thing is conversation didn't make me think of it I'll say this and get off you can comment but\nWith a really good quote on this that you can't go back and change the beginning of where you are what conversation you're and\nYou can start where you are you can change the ending\nI don't think that's absolutely what we can do it conservative\nI like that less thank you very great song I appreciate that Chris Nashville what are you saying Chris uh how should we be have\nActually actually our fall\nAnd the reason I over the years that we need to all their feet to the fire I'm just like a child if they want to tell them what they've done wrong\nI don't get in their face whatever they're a little meetings and get togethers and show them what they've done wrong show them that they are\nAll said is true we will\nGet very well and I this is my dilemma I mean you are exactly right I mean on one hand I my instinct\nIs always to be the better person to not be confrontational I mean it's hard to believe somebody talk Radio's not confrontational but I mean in in personal interactions I'm not ... and I and I and I think it's it's irritating to me when somebody comes in and breaks up a rally\nBought but the other side of the equation as it worked if their if their goal was to throw the black wearing campaign author message it worked\nBecause I looked at all of the headlines and every headline was about protesters and not about what was being said at the rally and there was important stuff being said there yesterday\nAnd so you know ... you know they they get by house not taking any action by us you know I'm\nOut in allowing this to happen without you know a an equal and opposite reaction I Wonder sometimes if we if we are not you know just giving giving up and in some ways and letting them have behind you having them to control the message that's I guess that's one of their controlling the message by doing that\nAt least in the mainstream media a Roscoe and la Verne you're up next on nine of national mourning as what he's saying Roscoe\nBrian thank you so much technical ah [noise] I just [noise] you know ever since Trump's been elected it's been crazy after crazy from the left\nAnd it's like we don't know what to do I'm Glad you're having this conversation because what can we do with this amount of crazy coming from the left but I think that history will judge us history will judge\nWho comes out of this who stands for who stands on their principles what we believe in things like a discourse things like uh being being okay we're having borders for our country you\nKnow history looks back and see the change that has come about from as they will point to a group either negatively or positively and if we stay in the right\nKnow not necessarily on the on the right side of politically but just on the right side morally Marlowe either American on the right side of the state of that we could be judged as being the ones who promoted freedom in America way as opposed to the to the guys who are trying to who are trying to rip it\nDown high Roscoe thank you so much for the call I greatly greatly appreciated suddenly Roscoe was working out there ... gallons in your arm was Bryan on nationals morning news what do you say you're the last word\nOh All right thanks for having me this morning listen I just think that we we almost need a hotline because they don't really have a message there messages simply disruption\nYeah so there's me whether having a ... when they were having a rally somewhere ... if what they're doing is peaceful protests and we should also have peaceful protests at their rallies or called disruption if you want but ah I it really needs to stop somewhere that that that if you look at the civil war\nIt was a very civil war than I Am\nSo I'm civility ended and where we're headed right now is not good countermeasures\nOr important ... we really got to take it to them if they could shut down Marsha Blackburn rally 'em by simply using peaceful protests tactics we should be out there doing the same thing we need a hotline but we can call today there's a rally get down there quite\nA while I Will say there's they're organized they really are they know where to be you may know how to get there and they know how to infiltrate and they're planning I mean they actively plan this stuff you know I I don't watch it honestly I don't like the other side when they do it\nI think my instinct is that probably what happens here is they irritate more people than they are bring to their side by doing this I think it actually works against them\nBut I I Want to figure out how we can overcome the affected bishop those protests because\nThey can be quite effective when it comes to determining what message gets out or to the public six or seven fifty five now on
