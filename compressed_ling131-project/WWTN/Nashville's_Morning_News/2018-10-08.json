you\nThat's what I understand I understand it's real good\nHe's real good and I'll tell you um you know Bradley Cooper comes across the board and he plays the part a lot like Chris christopherson did back in the day a sort of a you know a a guy's a little rough around the edges been drinking too much got a problem go to a drug habit button Lady Gaga let me tell you\nThere are moments where\nYou just are just enraptured with her performance wow I mean I'm telling you it was the one of the most powerful performances I've seen in a long long time I know she's got to be nominated for an Academy Award there's no doubt in my mind\nAnd and I must say I I did not expect to like if this much why was that good I really really loved it so um that there's that\nAnd I understand that did that Bradley Cooper might performs the he he actually is performing these songs it's in seeming\nHere's my take on that I think he's saying yes\nThe guitar work I think some of it is his or or he is capable of playing the guitar and a certain way right I I don't think that all of the guitar work which is ... it was shot in a very clever way where it really doesn't become an issue I mean\nWhen they're doing pictures of him on stage and you supposed to be playing the guitar there are a lot of flares and ... and the flashing lights and so you don't see closely is hands but it never really in you know except for a guitar players it doesn't matter guy 'cause he comes across as being credible a as on the stage and I I think his voice was fine and Lady Gaga I mean\nThere's all this stuff where she's it's just pared back her and the piano or singing you know a song\nBut it but this is the thing Taylor Swift\nIn her endorsement of Brad Olson is supporting a candidate who supports the nomination of judge rabbit Brett Devin ought to be a Supreme Court justice so\nJust you know remember that Taylor a [laughter] you supported a candidate who supports Brett Kavanaugh listen I don't\nThink it amounts to hold hill of beans but there are some interesting things happening very interesting things that are starting to happen as a result of the Kavanaugh nomination\nThere's little doubt that that it has awakened conservatives and Republicans and editors persuaded a great number of people who who sit in the middle in this country people who are um the moderates you know ... elections are often decided by the moderates which way with the mushy middle go\nWell apparently a lot of people in the middle\nHave really been irritated but what they've seen happening with this cabin all nomination and there are trends now that suggest that Republicans are awake\nAnd engaged and fired up in a way that they weren't\nThere was one say ten point enthusiasm gap between Republicans\nAnd Democrats Democrats were much more enthused about voting in this midterm election and that has all but evaporated and as we look at new polls\nWe see a certain certain trends starting to happen conservatives who had concerns you know how coming home I mean I've been I've been begging you to do this\nAnd and and maybe you're listening to me maybe it's the capital thing maybe there's something else maybe you're just looking at the economy on fire and say well you know this is pretty good whatever it is at the last minute here as we get closer and closer to election day Republicans are coming home\nIn a way that we thought they might not in this midterm election\nAnd that has has had a tremendous impact on the campaign or for the Senate seat in the state of Tennessee which is being watched very closely

him back you know it's not so much the conviction network you know not worried about is getting older and a place hopefully so again it's been six months and it's gone on long enough\nLet's see er fifty five percent of respondents say the Kavanaugh a is making them more motivating ... more motivated to to vote so let's get let's get that let's get the fifty five percent of those surveyed in the CBS poll say that the whole situation with Kavanaugh\nMakes them more motivated to vote now I mean I'm sure there are some Democrats who are also motivated to vote because they didn't like the way it went but vast majority we already know I'm a believed that the Kavanaugh or should have been confirmed forty seven percent so\nYou know there is something about the cabinet thing that has energized people there was no doubt about it Trump past sixty percent approval ratings and the state of Tennessee sixty percent approval ratings he goes out he supports a Marshall bread is a Marsha Blackburn\nA the tabloid thing motivates a few people all all things ...\nThat are um ... and now appears that Marsha Blackburn is poised to become the next senator I mean look it's early anything can happen but what happens in races is that toward the end as we get down to the last days of a campaign I'm\nGenerally the undecided voters start to break one way or the other\nAnd in this situation I think that's what's happening some of the undecided voters I've decided to break in and cabinet or may have been a motivating factor in that\nI think the rest of it is that Republicans have who ah were maybe a little concern and wanted to vote for rather than because they had some kind of warm feeling for him because when he was governor I don't I don't understand that but they may be they came around to the conclusion that you know what we really just can't afford\nFor this to be a democratic seat we can't run the risk of giving Democrats control the Senate I think the Republicans are coming home\nAnd I think undecided or breaking a more decidedly for black born over reticence repeat\nOne more time we have two polls now at Fox poll and a CBS poll which show that Marsha Blackburn is pulling away\nAnd the senatorial race now I think the numbers need to keep going because I think they need to get up around fifty three fifty four percent but this is really really good news is

a knock on the door this he's minding your own business in your house knock on your door on Montgomery avenue in east Nashville she answered three men are they're one of the men held at gunpoint the other two went to her house\nBut he said the men did not find anything and they stole her car and per se and then took off\nTo see this this bothers me a great deal\nWe we should not live in a town where grandmothers are robbed at gunpoint in their own homes\nAnd\nWhen you have that going on something is is really really alone in the one that one is going on what's causing this um well the victim\nSon says he's so motivated by this event that he wants to pursue a city council seat where you could promote anti violence practices and here's this quote these kids are for lack of a better

tragic accident in upstate New York um you know the let me just tell you the national Transportation Safety board\nThey are among the most professional organizations that I've ever come in contact with in Washington and all the years that I work there I I walked away so incredibly impressed with these people and what they do\nAnd and they don't really have any authority to write laws or to to promulgate policy they just simply go out and their investigators and they're very good at what they do whether it's a train accident whether it's a car accident whether it's a plane crash\nOr whatever it might be they're the ones who are called to the scene to try to figure out what went wrong and their record of trying to figure these things out is pretty good overtime\nThere they they have no no a political ... a protest angle that they come at this thing from all they do is make recommendations\nAnd give you the results of what happened what will happen in this particular case well there have been some calls in the recent past to make sure that there are safety standards set for limo companies\nAnd that seems to be something that should be handled on the state level but there have been calls for federal laws about these kinds of things and that might be something that Congress would take up again the national Transportation Safety board can only make a recommendation they can't force a rule on people they don't have that ability\nThey ... they are good at what they do and they will get to the bottom of this but twenty people killed in a limo crash\nAnd and

program it means so much to me I've been welcomed I'm blessed and thank you\nUm I Want to start or this or this half hour by talking about this Marsha Blackburn poll\nCut something is going on something is happening I Would love to be able to take full credit for this because I've been pounding the table I mean [noise] pounding the table repeatedly telling you folks what are you thinking about some of you out there ten percent of Republicans in previous polls\nSaid that they were going to support Phil Bredesen I kept saying what are you thinking about you cannot do this\nYou can't do it for a lot of reasons number one this guy's taking money from Chuck Schumer number two this guy's taking money from from a Michael Bloomberg a man who wants to take away your Second Amendment rights\nOnly twenty six percent said it would be a the reverse uh about thirty percent said it didn't really they didn't figure Trump into this at all\nI'm forty seven percent of those that were surveyed by CBS said they supported the Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd thirty percent said they opposed the nomination so that's a Seventeen point gap they sort of explains while Phil Bredesen\nCame out of the last minute\nAfter being dogged and asked the question dozens and dozens of times he finally came out and said well if you if I had been there I Would have voted for him you know when they when it was done when it was all said and done he has the that man that's an active political courage isn't it\nPhil Bredesen\nYeah oh yeah well now that we know how it's going to come out I Would have been in favor of that I have no patience for politicians who licked their fingers and put them into the wind just say which way the political winds are blowing come on and make a decision what do you stand for well apparently he stands for nothing until it's safe\nBut anyway forty seven\nForty seven percent of those surveyed said they supported the Kavanaugh nomination thirty percent said that they they did not\nUm there's a fifty five percent of the respondents said that ah the cabin all matter was something that was motivating them to vote and I think about that from it fifty five percent of respondents say they're being motivated to vote\nBy the Kavanaugh nomination that now that could cut both ways it can be those who were angry about the way Kevin always treated it could be those who oppose the nomination but remember we have another poll out here that says another item in the fall but says that forty four percent of those would be supporting Trump\nSo that means that about twenty two percent maybe cutting the other way so there's roughly what you got going OK\nMarsha Blackburn gets high marks on the following according to the polling data immigration crime and gun policy and I want to talk about gun policy just a little bit\nBecause remember Phil Bredesen is taking money from of all people Michael Bloomberg who wants to take away your Second Amendment rights\nHe's so desperate for money right now they don't take it from anybody including Michael Bloomberg who's got one issue and only one issue but he cares about taking away your Second Amendment rights\nAnd if you were among those people out there in Montgomery County were walking around loaded for bear while there was a madman running around a murderer running around and you felt like I'm safer because I have this weapon and I'm protecting myself I'm embracing my Second Amendment rights just remember\nThat Phil Bredesen is taking money from a guy who wants to take away your rights to do just that\nSeven

worked out and we have we gone in there with him in Moline hammer and technology into submission that's what we've done now we're talking we're talking about uh that you consume community oversight board is this a good thing or a bad thing for Nashville a councilman\nSee bummer is on the line now and he has a decidedly strong opinion he thinks it's a bad idea good morning to your councilman\nGood morning sir how are you\nWell I like it when a when a plan comes together eventually so why are you in now why are you against this idea I give me your sense of it\nWell we already have enough oversight quite frankly I police officers you know are there in microscope more than ever before in our history I Believe uh the mayor's office you have to count you have the courtship the main you've got about eight layers of oversight that already exist\nUp or a police officers or they they have a job that frankly I could not do a you know thank God they're willing to do it because they're the ones when when we're running away from from issues they're running towards the issues to protect us and\nI what what scares me the most about this is we're going to have more and more officers leave us here in Nashville and at that 'cause we're not we don't pay them enough number one but then we can she needs more scrutiny on them\nThat it's purely on that Syria and I know that my anger ... what I said that it truly is a necessary because we already have enough layers of oversight during place\nI I agree with you on that uh the way this particular concern community oversight board is configured\n... eleven members as I understand it can come from any part of Nashville but the but the ... but the referendum specifically calls for foreign members coming from the economically distress communities in Nashville do you have some concerns about the way that his couldn't figured\nWell I have concerns about the entire board but let me let me tell you about one thing that really ought to catch people off guard here uh because I asked for a legal opinion late last week and got it and the illegal alien in the city you don't even have to be a US citizen can sit on this board\nThat concerns me greatly because frankly I you know if you if you're here legally great we're glad to have you I mean we were in nation of immigrants but\nYou know illegal aliens being able to sit on the board judging our police officers\nTo me that it absolutely ludicrous so there's ... there's not one aspect of this thing that bothers me it's the entire process the entire\nMakeup of this that bothers me but that one particular area where you could have somebody who's not even a U.S citizen sitting on a bulletin board judging our police that have to go through a rigorous testing process\nTrying they continue to train I mean they go out every day and work on extremely hard for every one of the year in in Nashville and for that matter every police officer throughout middle Tennessee and throughout this nation\nYou know it's a tough job being a police officer I have a lot of respect for police officers in the job they do their the thin blue line there the number of people as you say who run toward the danger when everybody else who's running away\nAnd it right now uh they're not as you say not making a great deal of money and the money that they were promised was denied them because apparently that are going to the city can't balance its books and can't come up with the money to pay people what they promised at a time when the mayor is giving his people six percent raises\nYeah well I mean ... we've had numerous conversations on this Bryant and you know how I felt about that I\nMean it's disgusting that that occurred in the mayor's office and we couldn't we couldn't give our employees a promised three percent cost of living adjustment uh I mean that is absolutely\n[laughter] that that almost unforgivable a but it's just it's sickening to see those kind of things happening in our city\nYeah I Want to be you're talking about but it's sort of the one two punch number one it's a tough job and by the way I get a sense I don't know if anybody else can it feels this way but I knew then it's getting rougher out there on the street so that what they're basing on the street on a daily basis is a lot more than it has been in the past\nThere not being paid very well uh and they and they they got promise to raise and then that was ripped out of their hands and they didn't get that and then ... then the last thing is now you've got this this referendum or in in Davidson county that will have this really really\nScrutinizing look at every single thing that they do is now going to be questioned I if I were a police officer I got to tell you I'm not sure I Would be up for that\nRight well and and the the the the group that organized the community over ... oversight board says well they will they don't really have any authority they they can't really they can only make recommendations well what the purpose you know if it's just create more had to go to police officers that's not a good into the ... year\nOr so from my standpoint I'll be talking to folks and let me let me say this but I'm a very quickly Brian\nI Do believe you're one of the great reasons why\nA black man is now moving in the polls correctly well we as conservatives have to get out we got to go vote this November this one may be one of the most important things we do still be will be on that so it's a vote no on amendment one so I I'm I'm praying that we get out we vote\nAnd that we you know we kind of take the city back\nBecause we can't afford to keep doing what we've been doing it it just does not work\nYeah I I'm with you on that do do you get the sense is I Do that something has shifted in recent days\nOh absolutely and you know I I ... and thank God uh that it has because you know we we have to have more\nOf a balance you know neither side can pull so far to the left or to the right and think it's going to be okay we got to find a way to come back into the middle but the only way could do that is if you have balance\nYou you can't ship all the power to one side or the other and I'm not talking about Republican or Democrat necessarily I'm Talking about the moderate and an independent who really are going to be you know kind of the saving grace in my opinion because\nIf you're a Republican you got to vote Republican there are people who say well I'm a Republican but I'm voting this other way well then an independent in mind but\nUh I mean I I'm a Republican I'm very happy and I'm very proud to say that uh and that's the way I vote because that's what I Believe if you're an independent it's okay but I Do believe the independence of the moderates are the ones who are starting to wake up and say well you know maybe it shifted a little bit too far to the left and we need to bring it back\nAnd I I think you're onto something I think you're right and and for people in in Davidson county which is you know is predominantly democratic ... the Democrat Party controls the politics we when's the last time there was a Republican mayor I mean it's been ... there was a yeah it's been there and so here's a here's the thing if you're not happy\nWith the way things are going if you think that changes need to be made then why do you continue to do the same thing you've done time and time and time again you know what the definition of insanity is the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over over and expect a different result if you're not satisfied\nThen why wouldn't you want to make a change my why wouldn't you want to say to the party that's been in power forever and that got you into the message you're unhappy with\nOldest do more of that I I've never understood that\nWell nor buying my closing statement which would kinda be this you know it was amazing after the soccer both so many people walked out of the council chambers patting themselves on the back about a great job we've done I don't remember anybody patting themselves on the back\nThirty on ... and we are with\nYour Tom store he's got
