be aware of what's going on with the weather around you [noise] but apparently now there are some uh some new reports out\nLet's suggested we need to be really weather aware when it comes to tornadoes in Tennessee\nAnd Kim Weaver I Know you're in the newsroom you you have spent a lot of time and what we used to call tornado alley yes and and I say Houston all explained that at the moment you know in in Oklahoma and the taxes or that was considered\nYou know where the big tornadoes would show up and I mean how many times has more City Oklahoma benefit by tornado alley I mean that's like new tornadoes central ...\nWell according to a new study that came out\nOr do you have the day of the country's tornado alley a twister heavy area typically associated with the great plains is now moving eastward\nLet me let me just read you this one line out of the story which caught me by surprise I did not know this the national oceanic and atmospheric association said boy I'm having trouble one sorry I said the Ford deadly states for tornadoes are\nAlabama Missouri Tennessee and Arkansas\nAnd they say the tornado alley which has always been you know largely sort of a Texas Oklahoma Arkansas thing ... is now moving east it's coming our way\nSo tornadoes are now chasing me\nThat's all right instead of the other way around the exactly what it means it means that you have brought them with you [noise] ah no ... apparently it's nice you know look I mean take it take it with a grain of salt but they look at this thing's statistically aware of been the most tornadoes yeah and and you know that's pretty definable statistic\nAnd it turns out not as many tornadoes are occurring\nIn Texas not as many are happening in Oklahoma because the climate there they say\nIn recent years has gotten more dry right and so that that that the the line the dry line the tornado alley where it's dry on one side and marched on the other Gulf fair meeting dry air is what causes these tornados along a certain line\nWell they say that that line climatology cold climates logically has moved to the east\nAnd arrest and so we are now you know we can no longer say the Texas and Oklahoma is tornado it's us\nWow this is tornado alley\nAnd I'll tell you there's nothing more uh you know destructive I think than the ... I mean a hurricane covers a bigger area mhm but but I but I mean a tornado man I'm telling you\nIt's uh it it it can just absolutely destroy a community and so we need to be more aware of that and be ready for that and be aware of our weather around us and you know especially during that very you know busy tornado season in the spring right so anyway you've been a you've been chasing tornadoes a long time\nYeah I did a lot in the nineties ... I mean my you know I I was in Tulsa my thoughts on on\nThe days when the you know the alerts were issued he would send\nMe out I I Would drive hundreds of miles to the southwest corner of Oklahoma and I would start writing storms that were born in West Texas and I would ride those storms all the way into Tulsa is that right and by the time they got to tell us that then you had full blown tornado watches and tornado warnings\nDidn't let me I was like I was like a garage door opener it was literally a clicker oh yeah like ... and I would click this button and the fiscal map would rise into the ceiling yes I remember though and then then you would see the green screen\nAnd I would show you the black and white satellite photo which is all we had at the time\nThat's the only thing that was provided by the government was a black and white satellite photo mhm so I mean that was how we did our our weather but occasionally\nThe clicker would jam and and the screen that the for the\nPhysical map would come up about half way why our garage or the ... going halfway up right it would stop and then I thought well how do you do them on let's go to the forecast that's where I live TV baby I'm telling you\nI was so rudimentary back in the day when we were and the nowadays they got all this new stuff this new technology yeah but I mean we really you know we did it with a lot of bailing wire and chewing gum and and or in some scotch tape half the time and you know that that's what was holding the stuff together behind the scenes but my best\nWeather cash to ever was on the Thanksgiving when I brought into the studio alive [noise]\nA big\nTurkey and I and so I sat down and said oh and I start to do the weather forecast\nAnd I've got the turkey under my arm\nAnd and I'm sitting on the set and I turned my anchorman so Eli our our forecast looks pretty nice for a for Thanksgiving Day and and friday when people go shopping I never mention\nThe fact that I have a turkey [laughter] and then I go I go to the map and I do the entire weather forecasts and I still got the turkey under my hand and I and I and I come back to the set\nAnd I still got the turkey no mention is made throughout the weather and then I'm walking with like a thirty pounds turkey under my arm I was getting ready to say it's just one of those big fat white turkey I write it was a while to start is I mean I think it was sort of a black turkey and have it in ... her neck you know and so I I I ... and\nAnd so people were talking about this did you see Wilson you see is whether forgives you had a turkey under his arm but he never talked about it it was like the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room so come back ten o'clock right I'm ready to do the ten o'clock yeah and I decided well I Can't do the same thing\nSo I show up and I got the turkey under my arm and I'm sitting on the seven I'm Talking to the anchorman who was by the way\nTerrified of this turkey he was absolutely frightened to death of it and you're in you know and again we started out by not acknowledging the turkey ride and I say I'm Talking about well you know can do the weather does look like pretty nice I I was sort of the map right now in by the way would you hold is for me and I hated him to turkey\n[laughter] and I walked over to the weather map without the turkey and all in the background here [laughter]
