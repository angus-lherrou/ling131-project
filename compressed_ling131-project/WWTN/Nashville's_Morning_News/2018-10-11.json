dot com you can hear the whole thing okay\nThe undercover journalist is like he wouldn't really vote for Kavanaugh witty and a woman by the name of Maria Amal answer's no it's a political move\nHe thinks like we're down like half a point now it's like really close and we're losing by a point or two so he thinks if by by saying that he's appealing to more moderate Republicans he'll get more of them to vote for us and they weren't let me paraphrase that if we lie to the people of Tennessee we might actually win this thing\nThe journalist is I'm so confused because I just can't believe he would actually vote for Kavanaugh see she's drowned them in Stuart uh this guy will Stewart says well he wouldn't he said he would which I don't know if it makes it worse or better know it makes it better in other words it's better when the candidate is lying\nTo you it continues or this woman Marshall says we would scare all all the people who would vote for Phil Bredesen but not Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nAnd then and then this guy Stuart jumped in and says yeah exactly because there's a lot of Republicans who are going to vote for Brad Olson\nAnd he continues yeah and how they're messaging against us he's going to vote is going to be a toe the line democratic voter that's what that's what the people and the and the Blackburn campaign or saying because there are people who loved him as governor but won't vote for a Democrat and national office in orange he's tried to pull the wool over your eyes\nSo the journalists you know just to put a big bowl on this listen to this listen to this so you're saying he'll lose voters if he says uh he would not confirm Kavanaugh and this woman stewards this oh straight up yeah\nAnd then the journalist asked are the people to Tennessee value ignorant\nAnd this guy Stewart says yeah\nDid you hear that did you hear that the people on the British in campaign have no regard for you the voter they believe you are

Capital Management learn more we can see 'em dot com yeah um [noise]\nHere's what you need to know yeah eight hundred and thirty one point yesterday at dropped the NASDAQ dropped about four percent yesterday as he dropped about three point three percent both uh down in the ... ... s in pay posted the biggest one day drops since early February and it was all behind this rising interest rates fears\nAnd a pivot out of technology stocks have made it a rough last few days according to CNBC the Dow has dropped for the five last session so that's what's going to it's going to be an ugly day to day it'll be a probably an ugly data tomorrow\nAnd there was an ugly day yesterday but it's not a reflection of the economy as a whole which remains very strong the bones of this economy are very high very good\nUm and and speaking of interest rates here's what that means OK mortgage rates on a thirty year home had five percent a nearly five year high\nThat's right a five year high um and uh\nSo here what are we really talking about in practical terms what does that mean to you\nWell that's not the end of the earth is not the end of the world yeah interest rates are going up but how long have we have low interest rates I mean the longer than anybody ever imagined we've had practically free money out there\nAre so in the first week of Jim this is let's take a typical house let's say you're trying to buy a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home thirty year mortgage and you're put in\nTwenty percent that that's that's sort of the the industry standard scenario right um so here here's in June your monthly payment would have been about a thousand and forty three dollars\nAs of today it'd be about forty bucks a month more as not make or break for most people what what that means do however is over the total a lot of a life like sorry life of the loan you'd probably pay another\nThirteen thousand dollars\nIn interest that is what it means what month to month you're talking about forty bucks\nThat's what it means so yes interest rates are going up a thirty year mortgage right now is is a at five percent little over five percent and your monthly payment under two hundred and fifty\nThousand dollar home if you put twenty percent down Thirty years straight mortgage would be about a thousand and eighty bucks course taxes and everything else can add to that\nSo you know it is not horrible don't don't lose sight of the fact that it's still pretty good I remember a time when I was playing twelve percent interest on the house\nAnd I'm telling you just about killed me but that's what it was that's that's you have to look at these things historically and historically we've had a very low interest rate run for a lot of years and is this justified the interest rates going up\nWell the economy is really burgeoning and it's it's kind of heating up a little bit full employment so again this is not unexpected it's not unexpected so yeah okay the Dallas taken a hit and yes interest rates are and she got a little bit keep it in perspective keep it on a perspective\nHere is the good news for you Nashville you're ready we are still one of the hottest real estate markets in the country\nUh we got I got this thing and the Tennessee and it talks about the top ten real estate markets were number five\nDallas is number one Brooklyn New York of all places this number to Raleigh Durham is number three Orlando was for Nashville is five we are ahead of Austin Boston Denver Charlotte Tampa saint Pete that's right\nUm housing costs are a little more expensive right now because the economy here is so strong that you know with a strong economy comes things like this people are moving here they still true\nWe wait for a while we thought it wasn't true but it is still true that about a hundred people a day move into the Nashville area\nA hundred people a day like I live somewhere\nAnd so they're coming in here and and such driving up interest rates is all supply and demand there's demand and the supplies a little low and that means the prices go up [noise] but that's that's also means that if you have a house\nIf you haven't heard the story and you do not want to miss the seven o'clock open to this uh this show because it has to do with the Bredesen and a Blackburn campaign for Tennessee's Senate\nThere was a debate last night but I'll tell you what I
