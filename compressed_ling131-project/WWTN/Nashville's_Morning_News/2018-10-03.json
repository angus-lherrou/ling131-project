N. dot com\nSix thirty seminar Nashville's morning News I'm Brian Wilson and I'm\nI'm telling you this story in the Tennessee and caught my eye\nSome guy in good reporting by joined garrison over there\n[noise] the covers a metro Nashville listen now here's the thing [noise]\nNot against the idea of giving tax breaks to developers in some situations I think it can be very helpful\nEspecially in a time in a place where the economy is suffering or a town is not growing you know giving some incentive to bring in people who will build new buildings and which create jobs or it could be a really good and positive thing\nBut that presumes that you don't let it get out of control and that you don't make so many promises to so many people and give so many tax breaks to so many people at the same time that you end up not able to make your obligations in other words you can't make ends meet\nThe mayor is fond of saying our current dynamic mayor David Bryant like he's very fond of say oh the city's not broke the city can't pay its bills or its obligations it can't do for the workers wanted promise to do\nMay not be broke but they certainly haven't lived up to the promises that they have made and I think he's a he's playing with words on that so they're they're gonna put a moratorium on this thing called a tiff what is a tiff TI F\nStands for tax increment financing now according to the uh Tennessee and here's the way that all works\nI'm a tiff used on several high profile Nashville development projects works this way\nThe council first designate scenario for redevelopment them the metro development in housing agency awards funds to a developer to help with land acquisition parking infrastructure and some other limited uses\nFuture property tax revenue generated at that side is then diverted to pay down the balance of the loan All right so how does that work out well here ears and twenty Eighteen\nMetro diverted thirty one point five million dollars of property tax revenue to pay off the loans\nUh and nine point eight percent of that was a had been earmarked normally for school districts and you know the districts uh educational program as lacking that's a that's a kind way to put it could have used that nine point eight million dollars\nSo and it seems as if they got a little carried away and giving these tax incentives to developers and gave too many of them away and now have had to pay too much money to pay back those loans\n[laughter] I'm Sorry I just got an idea I just can't I Can't put you through that\nI Do think this is an important race\nAnd I want to mention again that I Am I'm I'm baffled by one part of of what I see on a statewide level\nI see bill Lee owning Karl Dean I mean the numbers are not even close are able to take a miracle for for Karl Dean to pull something out of that at this point it seems that the uh\nThe the the outcome is I wouldn't say pre determined but it's looking pretty good but why is the Senate race so different\nWhy is it a nip and talk race between Phil Bredesen and Marsha Blackburn\nThis is a Republican state and I'm I'm baffled by the fact that so many people\nWho profess to be conservatives\nAre being taken in by Phil Bredesen who won't say anything\nAbout a ... the cabin all matter one of the most important things we can know about Bill Bryson right now is if you were a senator how would you vote in the cabinet batter and he won't say because it's controversial and he doesn't want to be controversial\nRight now if you look at all the polls it's deadlocked it's dead even and I don't understand why that should be the case\nI don't get it I don't understand why and Republican red Tennessee Phil Bredesen is neck and neck with Marsha Blackburn\nAnd I think you need to understand and then I'm really get this outlawing now 'cause Marsha Blackburn is going to join us in the eight o'clock hour but I Want to get this out all the way now so they don't have to talk about up there\nI don't understand why in the world or a Republican or a conservative would think it'd be a good idea to have Phil Bredesen go to the Senate when in in entirely possible that as Tennessee goes so goes the control of the Senate\nI mean Ted Cruz has got to fight on his hands in Texas He may lose [noise]\nA and Phil Bredesen may win here\nAnd if that if if if the if if it doesn't straightened up it's possible I mean these numbers are nip and talk\nAnd if ... percent of the Senate there is a very good chance to the Senate is going to be in the control of one Chuck Schumer have you saw have you thought this through do you really want that to be the outcome\nThat Tennessee puts Chuck Schumer over the line it makes them the majority leader of the Senate folks I'm telling you right now\nIn the house of representatives is looking grim it's looking pretty grim um I don't\nI don't think it's beyond the realm of possible I mean I think I think it's entirely likely that Democrats will take the house I hate to tell you that I Know you don't want to hear it\nBut I I got to be straight with you I look at the numbers I've been doing this long time it doesn't look good maybe something will happen maybe this cabin all thing as you were taking enough people but it changes but for the moment as a snapshot looks right now it's not good\nIn the house of representatives it's too close to call as for who will control the Senate\nAfter these mid term elections but you don't want the Democrats to be in charge of both houses you certainly do not want that and uh you don't want Chuck Schumer and Dick Durban Dianne Feinstein and Bernie Sanders\nAnd a whole host of loony Democrats in charge of the key committees of your United States Senate\nSo wake up

key thing here it doesn't look good\nFor Republicans right now it doesn't look Graham I'm going to be honest with you I Know that's not news that you want to hear but I got to tell you folks painful [noise]\nAll right so what you need two hundred and Eighteen votes in the house to control the majority\nWhoever gets a two hundred and Eighteen votes gets to pick the speaker of house and you will be in charge and as I said in the past the difference between being in the majority and being in the minority is like the difference between chicken salad and chicken poop\nYou like the chicken salad you don't want the chicken poop\nAll right so you need two hundred and Eighteen votes to control the house of representatives as it stands today looking at the real clear politics map and I think they've got a pretty good read on this stuff 'cause they average out all the polling data and usually have a pretty good track record of getting close to write\nUm if the election were held today a it looks like a two hundred and six Democrats a hundred and eighty nine Republicans there are forty seats right now that are too close to call\nForty seats so you need you need a two hundred and Eighteen they pretty much got two hundred and six sewed up so they got to pick up ... seats that's really what it boils down to read that but at the moment at this particular snap shots\nBut but you can't win\nWithout the people in the middle\nI mean it's just the way things are are are right now you have to persuade the mushy middle that you have the better viewpoint\nAnd that means sometimes you have to offer a moderate position and people of the hard core Republicans and I count myself as one of them don't like many times to see these moderate positions being espoused by conservative candidates\nBut that's the only way you win a sadly and are in this environment that we're in right now uh you can you can make the case you have the better ideas\nBut you always have to think about how do I get those voters in the middle to come my direction and not let them go to the other guy really\nI'm Sorry folks if if if you don't understand that about politics you have only a rudimentary understanding of what politics are the power in politics is always in the middle\nAnd and you can have your beliefs and you're going to have the things that you stand by but sometimes you have to go

line well matters who turns out yeah that's always the case in every election but I think more accurate to say\nIt all matters one of the middle does it's a middle goes to the right than the
