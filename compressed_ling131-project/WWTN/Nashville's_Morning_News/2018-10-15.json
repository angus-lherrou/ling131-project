Weaver with your top stories and this heavy rain is going to preceded a cool down and in fact we're going to drop at least eight ... degree every hour from here on out will be in the upper fifties\nBy this afternoon right now we've got an accident north of town this is an sixty by north bound that long hallowed pike in good let's fill\nThis involves a tractor trailer and a possible fuel spills keep that in mind got the forecast traffic updates in five minutes\nAnd that was up but about four hundred thousand Republicans cast their vote in the primary so it's a hard it was hard number hard math to come over any way but then there's this for the most part is avoid talking about Trump\nThis is ... although he has been critical of his trade policies and called the separation of migrant children from parents with us border morally bankrupt he's not promoting the idea of a Democratic Senate takeover\nQuote if this gets to be a race about a Democratic majority in the Senate I'm In trouble [laughter]\nTo like man I started that a long time ago that's what it's all about a so anyway I just it it takes the window the sales of those have been trying to organize people oh yeah this is there's a there's a because he uh supporting Kavanaugh's confirmation but lately last minute\nYou know ... and then finally after it was all but clear that Kavanaugh was going to be confirmed\nAnd I said well I Would have been for it well it takes the wind out of the sales of those have been trying to organize people on the ground under the guys that bred as soon as a progressive cat is he's losing on both sides the Republicans who thought he might be okay for a while or they they they were frustrated that he waffles\nAnd ... and we use old and and didn't come out and say what he's going to do about Kavanaugh and they they got irritated with him then once when he finally did come out and said that he would have been for the nomination well the moderates and the progressives in the Democratic party they all they all said\nAnd done with you that that was a that was a game changer for them so he's losing both sides\nAnd and it's increasingly difficult to see a ... a pathway to victory for him so good news every body as predicted this is no longer a toss up race\nUh and as long as things stay the way they look right now ah this this races in pretty good order just like the governor's races\nYou know it's the governor's races seems to be in pretty good order as well\nGood job every body um [noise] let me talk briefly though about some other things that are going on in the Senate and who's going to control the Senate\nOr there have been changes of light and the real clear politics which is I mean it's a great way to look at these things they average out the polls is not always the best way to do it but it says good away as any\nAnd they have now seen changes in Nevada and Arizona uh they are noting that Texas has now safely\nUh in Republican a column and so there's this little thing on their map where you can take away all the toss ups and just say okay wherever we are in the polls right now the average of polls\nIf we just uh if we decide we're just going to go ahead and assigned them to the left or to the rights of the blue or to the red where would we be and it's called Senate know toss ups right now Senate know toss ups\nThe Republicans are positioned to pick up two seats that's right it would be fifty three Republicans and forty seven Democrats if that were election were held today and the polls were you know within reason to being accurate so you know things are looking pretty good in the Senate\nAnd the house of representatives is still a real a knife fight but I keep looking at the changes that are taking place and I mean ... that's the civil date seems to be around October fourth\nSomething happened\nAnd when I go back and look at the time out of what was going October forth that was just before that's about the time it became clear that Kavanaugh was going to be confirmed and he was confirmed a couple of days later but it looked you know about the fourth fifth and sixth that's when all that was going on\nAnd ah and then something started to happen dramatically a number of seats\nThat were toss up seat now start to be trending toward the GOP a ... right now the way it looks in the house of representatives is still a heavy lift but the thing you got to know is there if if the election were held today\nUh there there's twenty nine tossup seats that could go either way most of those are currently held by Republicans but I mean right now it's two hundred and five Democrats two hundred and one Republicans if the election were held today with twenty nine toss ups you need to Eighteen to Eighteen to control the house\nSo I what I'm saying here is the trend is good and there's still time but it's still a knife fight I mean it's close you could go either way in the house of representatives a betting man would put money on the blue here\nBut I don't think we're done yet I don't think the trend is finished\nBut it is undeniable since the about the time of the Kavanaugh confirmation something has changed in America and more people are moving from the left side of the ledger\nTo the right side of the ledger from the blue side of the ledger to the reds side of the ledger and it is absolutely verifiable it's absolutely traceable you can see evidence of it there's no doubt it's happening the question of how close can you get by election day\nYou had a lot of ground to make up a if you're going to hold onto the house of representatives and right now\nIt's getting closer but it's not there yet\nAll right so all of that uh is is that or not they don't where we are chock talk a good news everybody the the the brightest in a Blackburn racist seems to be\nHave made a tremendous change no longer considered a top toss up by a real clear politics and the Senate and good order

I actually held\nA new one thing that you can do\nAnd and I I don't um I I I very rarely liked to do this kind of thing but I'll tell you in all the years I was a reporter when I parachuted into a disaster seen\nAs we often dead we we were really good and the news business at getting a place very quick we logistics or something we did quite well we knew how to get to a place we knew how to be in the right place at the right time and that's very ...\nBut we do in the news business but even as quickly as we got to the to the scene and would start to cover the event ah the one thing that I always saw was the red cross was already there\nThe salvation army was already there and then behind them came to church groups and the it cetera listen I there is a real need and if I'm if the volunteer state\nCan do with it always does which is volunteer or its resources and its people I think it would be well received\nA if you can ... if you can't do that one of the the simple things you can do is make a donation or to a good charitable organization is doing good down there I Am a big fan of the red cross I'm a big fan especially of the salvation army because I'm telling ya\nEvery time I've gone to a place I've seen them doing good work\nAnd you know I Know people from time to time get irritated with these charities but I'm telling ya in times of need the salvation army and the red cross have always been pretty good\nSo I Want you to think about what you might be able to do a because you know one thing I Know about the people in this part of the world\nUm we have big hearts\nAnd we care deeply about our fellow southerners and our and our friends who are going to a tough time\nAnd if you can find that within your means if you can find it within your capability to do something that would be helpful to the situation than I Would say do it I Would say one thing I don't think it does a lot of good just send out a bunch of use clubs a lot of people always want to do that\nBecause it's something that they can do very quick on us gather up the clothes that we no longer where that is that at least that would be helpful you know actually it's not all that helpful\nUm and because what part of the rebuilding process is people need to be able to rebuild\nThe stuff that they want not just where somebody's hand me downs [noise] so uh I Would say if you can send a little casualties in send some resources do what you can the needs are many and and the tragedy is completely widespread I mean it may be\nKnocked days not weeks it may be months\nBefore electricity is restored to all areas\nI'm not making this up uh it ... it may be a long time before the cell systems start to work there it may be a long time before of the situation returns to ah any ... anything that even approaches normal in some parts of that disaster area it may never\nBe like it was not for many many many years\nSo I I all I can tell you is that the need is right and the the disaster wild huge and and and by the response while huge the disastrous future if you'll allow me to say that uh it is really something that ah they could use your help\nAnd uh and I'm hoping that I

was still on unfolding\nI never beat the red cross\nTo the scene of a disaster I never beat\nThe salvation army to the disaster those are the two organizations that I always saw on the ground as I was a riot and I was getting there quickly\nSo I Would say to you and and my experience I don't know I Can't speak a lot about the the organizations ah I Know some people have some criticism about them from time to time I will tell you this what I saw it with my own eyes\nWas that this the salvation army and the red cross was doing a lot of good on the ground at times when people really needed help\nAnd that may be one way that you can help\nMaybe you've got a church group is putting together a a load of stuff to go down there they need everything they need diapers or they need they need a
