don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great

authority unnatural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that\nYou need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nYou know so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and the cats sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes you write any do actually fill the relaxation after your drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who aren't paid\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking the count max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included\nIt's written type pain fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spin the nickel magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones just start cutting bone loss you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest at\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because he had a powder form you take hot water

Pincus on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of this because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the sciences or drift a little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you know to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late [laughter]\nNot your bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain calcium\nAnd neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this ... formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back in ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period and it it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this complex formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThey arthritic joints really respond\nTo this and I recently gave a a can of this to a lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every join her body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I start she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula and um\nShe said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer make it out to her friends that's amazing\nAnd when I use is with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes you than us before they're event so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication so many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium may need them in the system\nSo that very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fish and in many of them\nIt's also blocking further absorption\n... it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you

river side of that I've seen of lack of vitamin D effect fears flipped\nOkay another big sign is that your bones ache now there's a lot of people listening who have been diagnosed with al ... which is a thinning of the bowl but again a vitamin D deficiency\nA big one is muscle weakness so you try to get from a couch you get in and out of a car and you're finding it more and more difficult and that will lead into the high high prevalence of people falling and injuring themselves\nOh okay All right which is a huge problem right exactly\nI Know they wanted it tend to get more calls especially upper respiratory problems okay problems with\nBlood pressure cardiovascular problems digestive problems caused the patient bloating yeah mhm it's very very common and if you're a diabetic there's all kinds of data about being the fishing and vitamin D and the list goes on and on it's a huge problem\nWhat does vitamin D actually do in the body what is it used for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay and that regulates thousands of genes in the body everything from pain blood sugar immune system blood pressure phone string\nPlus ... has been linked to maintaining hall and health\nBrass ... an ovarian health\nBut I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it all messed up\nWell why do you say

the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin\nD the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone\nThat should be there and it's not there and the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from the shot what\nMakes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all I foot five thousand units of

I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWhile there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamins the three ... three is\nThe activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's\nThe best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the dean is going to end up going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for\nPregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning mhm\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on to the formula\nImagine living in your senior years where he can have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done ... clarity you know this is the more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pick is such that your ...

problem is you have instability of the ligaments of your lumbar spine so what do we do here first and foremost\nIs we have to re approximate the bone so generally speaking when you stretch and tear

themselves back together well how do you do that well she'll simple a chiropractic adjustments\nThe contractor so dumb or don't believe in our project this some sort of a witchcraft well actually it's the opposite of witchcraft\nIt's actually a matter of fact the most common sense that you could possibly do if you move a vertebrate out a position in your back yard to move back in the right position and not only that but don't you need to be able to have an X ray or something to tell you is the boat in the wrong position and if I moved it is it in the right position\nAnd would it be great if you could just shoot an X ray you're back to see if there's a stability issue in the ligaments in your back\nBefore you started so that is what I Do that is why I'm actually a part of a group of holistic

basically made up of the lower four or five nerves in your lumbar spider these nerves come together and they created a big bundle of nerves comes down your way and it's called the ...\nNerve right in that big fat nerve goes down there well you've also got a muscle called your pure form of muscle your performance mussels a bagel muscle\nIt's about the size of a sausage\nUm edits big around Ron ... cheek and um that sad if nerve goes deep to pure form of muscle and goes down your leg well problem is when you're ... you're pure form of muscle gets ... gets gets tight winds up smashing on that site addict nerve\nAnd that a pure form of muscle wind up getting basically tight and staff stick from sitting all day long believe it or not so when you sit you are extremely rotate your leg basically that means you're you're like how flops over what that does that shortens your ... your pure form of ... a muscle\nAnd then when you go to stand up and walk\nNow that pure form of muscle is tight and it's mad and it pushes on that side of nerve and it shoots pain all the way down your leg we know that a lot of people have this problem they get out of a chair or maybe you're driving for a long time and you get out of your um your seat you're you're ... your truck seat\nAnd you stand up and it's like oh my gosh it's like there's like a it's really big pain in your butt cheek\nAnd you go to walk and you've got to like walk free to like five ten Fifteen steps before the loose ends up enough did you can even walk and move and it's real simple why that happens because that that pure form of muscle is it's tight and it's faster can smash into that performance nerve\nSo what do we do to fix that well it's real simple get the ... so how are you going to do is going to have your whichever leg you're dealing with social we're going to pick on the left leg right now I'm ...\nI'm issues yet ...\nMuscle and that left lake ... how do we stretches so your city so it from a city position if you're doing this right now much each other's from a sitting position to your left leg\nA brand new bring it up put your left ankle on top of your right knee and when you're going to that's kinda like a figure for stretch here or the left ankle up on top of the right knee and what'd you leaned forward leaning that you have your back straight but you gonna lead on forward into that left leg

now we would do exam competition full set of X rays and a first adjustment all for forty dollars guys have you been thinking about this um if this makes sense to you and you're curious now is the time

give you the number again here before we're done um but you definitely need to do that now so as we talked about the mechanics of the lumbar spy the number one reason the people that have low back pain is because we've had these old injuries where we wind up stretching and tearing the ligaments in her lumbar spine\nAnd by the way this famous drew for your neck was neck painted headaches and\nAnd I'm a paint down to in your arm shoulders and hands but we wanted stretching and tearing these ligaments and what that causes instability when you're ... in stable that's going to or unstable it's going to cause your desks to ... basically the the nucleus to ... to strip through that disk and that causes ... all kinds of bad stuff\nBut what it also causes your muscles to have to fire I'm inspired him to stabilize those further because the the Lakers can't do it so that the muscles have to do it and that causes your back to shore an ATF particularly the end of the day it just feels really tired well if you don't do anything about this for long enough\nThat leads to arthritis in these vertebrae are unstable or grinding around your body doesn't want unstable ... what is it do\nIt lays down more bone and we call that arthritis arthritis has to do with how old you are it only has to do with how old your injuries are just have to do with your genetics and what your dad look like your grandpa look like it only has to do with your specific injuries now and that's what causes arthritis right are you seeing how this all works\nAnd then of course that Sadek nervous that one we should we showed that stretch early am I going to go through the stretch again\nBut that can cause instability can cause the picture that nerve and it causes that that your pelvis to not work correctly which shoots pain all the way down you're citing her down your leg just listened\nAnd is that that's the nitty gritty of the low back is not much more complicated than that\nIt's not more

Marty gets excited about and you can hear his passion is a helping you keep more of your hard earned money strategy so that you can pay less in taxes overall and sometimes what that means is\nPaying a little bit more now so you can pay less later you know Marty I had a ... or early in my career and he said Pete in life you have two choices it wasn't just about money it was really about anything in general\nYou can either pay now and you get to play later or you play now but you're going to pay later so here's what I Know about our culture we live in a culture that for the most part\nImmediate gratification wouldn't you agree with that afterwards immediate gratification\nJust telling me that I can save a hundred dollars less in taxes today I worry about the thousand I might have to pay later down the road I'm going to kick the can down the road because I don't want pain now I'll take pain later and so\nUm we don't think later will ever come when it comes when in this subject is in return\nThere for many people are living on a fixed income and now there's kicking themselves and they're saying\nWow why didn't I pay a little greater price earlier on so that now I could play more so it seems like the kinds of strategies that are in your books\nReally help people in the retirement years if they take action and if they apply the principals so that they can play in the season of life they deserve to play and wouldn't you say\nAbsolutely and you know it's not just taxes there's other issues going on I talk about my book for example okay as people get older they cannot take as much risk you can't make up for losses the older you get you don't have that much time threat so you have to start shifting your money from riskier assets they have more potential for growth stocks\nInto safer assets like fixed income investments and CDs things like that\nThe problem is in today's interest rate environment there's virtually no yield on those so another kind of tension I talk about in my book is\nHow do you kind of balance between oh I'd like to have growth but I don't want to take risks and oh I'd like to have safety but I don't get any return is what I call the savers dilemma that's another thing I Would dress in the book is how to overcome that dilemma\nWell the book the name is no compromise retirement plan our\nGuest is Marty ruby and he's an expert in

we'd love to be able to put your name on the list get you some of the information even before that happens a Marty's written a couple of books one is the new rules of retirement savings\nAnd I've read that book it's made a change in in my life and shoot you know I'm the financial advisor on the guru I'm Still learning Marty I bet you are to\nA and Marty's written another book that we want to get in your hands the no compromise retirement plan and uh he has some great information in there for all the folks today that are listening that set up a meeting with one of the beacon advisors you are going to get a signed an autograph book\nFrom Marty no charge to you so you can just on your own educate yourself no one of the things that I Will say Marty is you don't want to hear the word actuary unlike man dude in the financial\nBusiness you're one of the really smart guys who am I going to understand this book I read your first book\nAnd Israeli written for the everyday common person even though you may be very very smart I think a smart person takes those difficult things and makes them simple for the listeners in and that in itself\nIs an R. N. so congratulations on making these what seemingly can be difficult the topics\nVery interesting and very well written and easy to understand and hopefully even implement a very quickly but\nYou know let's talk about the fact that you you say okay this new book is directed towards many of us baby boomers\nUm I Know many of our listeners are somewhere between you know fifty in Seventy years old\nAnd they're kind of right there and so you you know you're saying that and and what I run into is we at that age have all saved a particular way tax deferred worry about taxes later when you're going to be in a you know hopefully a lower tax bracket\nWhat do we do about that now that we've saved that way\nAll right and I thank you for your comments on the book because I wrote her not to just point out their problems but also to point out the solution that's good now here's the problem\nFor most people they've saved under four one K. IRAs and I asked people you know where the term four one K. come from and most of them don't actually four one K. is a section of the Internal Revenue code\nIt's simply says if you're saving their four one K. here the patch rules under four one K. the Internal Revenue code you're saving or under\nSimilarly for hire a section for awake and so when you're standing in RA it says here ...\nNow I point out my book that there's other ways to save for retirement other than the four hundred section\nAnd the one that I like the best is a section called Seventy seven oh two so people say what is Seventy seven oh two actually Seventy seven oh two of the Internal Revenue code\nHere's how life insurance is tax now when I say life insurance I point this out in the book I said of people don't jump off off a roof you're that you're thinking about the old meaning of life insurance which is a pay a premium my kids get the death benefit I never see anything that's not what we're talking about here\nThere's a modern insurance fry called index universal life\nThat qualifies under section Seventy seven oh two as a tax free way to accumulate money\nBut index universal life was designed by the insurance industry as retirement savings tool it doesn't emphasize a big duck benefit rather emphasizes ways to accumulate cash that you use during your retirement years to generate tax free income\nAnd that's the big difference between saving are kind of attack smart way versus attacks of away\nSo we're not talking here about trying to create the largest death benefit we're talking about trying to create tax free income is that what I understand\n... absolutely and and here Peter's what our models do again you can have access to these to these models what we do is we analyze a person's tax the first savings\nAnd we say if you continue in that tax deferred plan here are the implications in terms of taxes you're going to pay and the amount of income you could reasonably generate between now and some assume a age such as Ninety five\nWe then compare that kind of under auction be too what if you took that money out of your ... today and we typically suggests over five year period\nPay the taxes on it and read a policy that money in a tax free index universal I policy and we project that forward and we look at what kind of income it'll produce and what kind of depth on the producers and the bottom line is when you tell people just light up these two reports together\nAnd left the numbers do the talking you decide if you like the results are under staying where you are today in tax deferred or the idea of moving some of your assets over in the tax free and just look at the numbers and you decide which ones are better for you\nSo if you love to get a copy of Marty's book the no compromise retirement plan we want to give you that book you don't have to wait till it comes on Amazon will give it to you what handed to you um and we will have it signed by Marty and we will do that tax\nAnalysis based on his software that will show a exactly what you're going\nTo need to pay in taxes and does it make sense to just kick the can\nFurther down the road or

lick and birds and don't know related to\nEvery once in a while I'll be gone and were were for a new portrait or a lot of time for them or\nFor them to play for a case here of like bao rattling and shaking their the five of the get a little little it'll go away and neutral\nBut that happens and everyone said like whether it's hot\nUm let me get this right at all oh notice it'll it'll go hot all of a sudden in the end and kind of share me pull over\nTurn it off or even free minutes turned back on it's fun it's don't know what may be causing this\nAnd you say goes hot like the temperature gauge\nThe temperature gauge shows oh it it'll say\nA losing power or the exact words engine losing power you know the trip to good goes completely all the way over the age you know freak out and pull over I think it's going to blow up\nDoes it ... it'll quickly or is it just do it like slowly\nA quick pretty quickly yeah 'cause it'll be totally normal on what I noticed this\nShake you know with an object will be totally on\nA you know get the deep end up losing an engine powered signal I'll say before I thought it was related to either or but I just feel like I'm Still doing it just every once in awhile\n... like once a week or\nSomething like you may have a thermostat maybe just sticking periodically on upon somebody in that will on me into the heart and it will show a loss of power like come on the beep or whatever [noise] any time of year olds running hard it's going to ... you will lose you will have an awesome power\nBeer and describe this rabble what was happening in\nA cage oh like they'll pull up to stop and a tobacco up a little while to pop it in reverse sometimes it's not even reverse oh\nI hear like about ... miles rattling shaking liquor shimmering should you know the the engine and if I put it in the true impact the gas a little rather go way\nAlmost sounds like a rusted out heat shield them the exhaust or something could be it could be ... when they put a commercial and maybe one of the shields may have gotten that slows possibly was doing it before the cover\nA it did before before\nThe doing burger maybe the muscle or something I don't know\nHuh [laughter] well I'm sure there was the issue in the right was appreciated guy\nAnd I'm In sorry we're best ... thank you buddy appreciate it thank you my last trip over here to another Steve over and castle pike see what's going on\nWe are calling their here this morning with a general question oh so are on the newer vehicle\nChecking awesome what would you stay with ... or ... or something [noise] they they said\nOh my gosh this is a heated\nA heated debate going right now\nYou know all of us shop owners um are frustrated because all the manufacturers I mean Rick was still on the longest I've seen Fifteen thousand miles on some on some of these was the longest you think you've seen and he was twelve so uh the problem with anything beyond like\nFive or six or seven is that a lot of these cars I mean now you got catalytic converters under the oil pan ... are up under just in the engineering and you just raising the temp you know down there\nBut um what's happening is this oil is if it's under the if the cat's under the oil being the oil gets boils um if you end up with a customer that maybe just drives I don't know let's just say eight thousand nine thousand miles\nIn the pan itself just gets really hot because it's close to the catalytic converter and it just creates a little\nLike you know you go to Dairy Queen get the ice cream cone you go and you dip it in the chocolate [laughter]\nFed and it was that film a chocolate on there that's about what we see when we pull these all pans off\nAnd are are you going to ask Rick we've we've had you can pull of outcome are often looked like somebody took a different tone it to the entire top of the engine and it's in sometimes worse like it's been ... twenty times you can't even see a bone [noise] um so the the issue right now is that\nLet's say a also if the Indian burns oil leaks oil ... if you go twelve Fifteen thousand miles there if it could slowly over time be sucking up what half a quarter to court every few thousand ...\nIt can in in a lot of manufacturers now say its engine consumes a quarter oil in dollars from miles that's acceptable according to their standards as well and she was doing a Seventy five hundred miles will change the whole court some oil\nThe Math Doesn't work out now and then the other issue is\nAs the oil at let's say it goes from seven course down to five course than five or seven uh four chords that for courts now is being you know in an old car Steve you're ... that oil would get sucked up into the motor and then dumped into the pan and recycled I don't know who knows how often but it just getting\nIf it goes from five six seven cords all the way down the half of what it originally habit it hasn't set off an oil pressure light yet that was being circulated twice as much right so now it's being used twice as much as it was before\nSo long story short if you're going to run synthetic do not listen to the age manufacture the reason for that as we replace a ton of these engines because people do yeah so um we ... we typically we keep it real simple three thousand miles for conventional\nAnd six thousand miles for synthetic and there's not really even conventional anymore it's all semi synthetic right which I ... everybody knows the semi synthetic as\nA conventional barrel of oil and they went to our old rep told us this\nHuman and tells you can take a teaspoon literally a teaspoon of synthetic and drop it in the barrel it's now considered semi synthetic there is no regulation stay in for how much the mixture needs to be right so they're all ... a semi synthetic now we can't even buy conventional\nOr that but that's what we still sell it asked yeah and it's a I don't know that we really recommend down just about anything except older stuff\nAnd it's not in one lump sum of the newer stuff now we're just\nThey don't call for synthetic not all vehicles do anymore yeah and\nSee all the turbo charged cars to do right now I Would say Ninety nine percent of all the ... or anything that controls valves\n... every Toyota since two thousand ten calls for for some time yeah\nSo I'm hoping answers your question maybe we gave you more than you want but at the end of the day or three and six and I would ... I Would not break away from that\nRoger Dodger okay thank you\nI buddy thank you so much or I guess we are at a break we got to come back ... neither side this is the fixing cars showdown ... every single Saturday tonight gives us a call six won five seven three seven nine nine eighty sixes a super talk nine seven\nEx delivery game day here at my return letter by delivering\nWith your Mayo Clinic radio half minutes I'm given a million times more\nIs actually less and that's exactly what the study found that even though it costs more addict half the cost I Can't take a tactic when ... when we added ... manner and\nDr Cary rest got let a recent study which found that for women with dance breast tissue adding and me I are molecular breast imaging to standard mammography which cost effective because it found nearly four times more cancers then demography alone\nSo why is all of this important well nearly half of all women over the age of forty have mammograms classified as dance so\nWhat is happening more and more now that women are becoming more aware as dense back and the implication that had him on there I think you know additional training\nWell MRI an ultrasound have also been looked at as supplemental screening options data from this study shows Andy I detect smart cancers with fewer false positives for Mayo Clinic radio I'm Vivian Williams\nThe possibility of lung cancer can be pretty scary especially for women to prompt some ... million smokers risk that's my seat\nAnd ask for a man named Keith to diagnose it right that now Keith\nOkay he's a euro specialist but he can do he can diagnose anything you put in front of him\nAnd a long hair ponytail guy got over there that um is uh like the mad scientist he will figure it out\nSo I'm a that's especially so try what Rick said what's your mechanic if you don't get anywhere\nPlease go there and I go a red tops and brought him or her own ... uh you know till the guys the front counter I called her on the show he said this is a really difficult issue the keys needs to be the woman inspects his car\nFor you put a harness on it because that's crazy yeah [laughter] it's big money\nThey actually so hard is it the courts out\nI'm not surprised but before you just keep throwing parts at it by now you've got to have some serious money in this thing and if you find that it's a five dollar
