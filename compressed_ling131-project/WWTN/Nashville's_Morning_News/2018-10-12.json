K. R. N. website which caught my attention and of course it's a story that we've been paying a great deal of attention to are right now it has to do\nWith this police involved and shooting with Daniel hammering they came up with a an autopsy and um\nIt was officer Andrew ... has been charged and decommissioned as an officer with this because they have ruled this to be a homicide that is the official ruling now of the medical examiner\nOr and so the report came out there and the the fraternal order of police who is the organization that can\nHave you see rank and file people can't really go to the microphones right so they do that through the fraternal order of police which often speaks on their behalf and here's what the fraternal order of police as that about that\nPursuing officers are often forced to use deadly force when an armed suspect turns around to target the officer or fire a weapon at the officer generally speaking of wound far to the right side of the head would be consistent with that scenario\nOfficer del key was pursuing a convicted violent felons was armed with a loaded military grade nine millimeter pistol officer dokey used deadly force to defend themselves the public in responding officers after the felony suspect refused multiple commands to drop his weapon\nWe are confident that officer del ... will be cleared from these politically motivated charges I Want to repeat again\nThey believe that the charges against the police officer object ... are politically motivated and by the way this decision to go forward with charges against a officer dokey a came at the hands of of uh Glenn funk the da\nSilva is against that backdrop that I bring you this next story because we have right now a referendum to create a community oversight board for the police department on the November sixth ballot\nThat is going to that's going to be there you're going to get a chance to vote on it in Davidson county and and the\nQuestion is whether or not should there be an eleven person born down the referendum seeks to create according to the Tennessee and an eleven member panel was investigative a compulsory powers to review and rest and other incidents involving police seven members would be appointed by community organizations\nTo buy council members and to buy the mayor but a majority of the council would have to approve each nomination\nThat's how it would work where is the mayor on this where is dynamic mayor\nDavid Riley well according to the Tennessee in and I haven't seen much on this the mayor's office has confirmed now\nUm [laughter] so I wanted that and the other thing that I wanted was a robot I mean I thought for sure by now I Would have my robot and and I and I used to watch jets and shit and Rosie the robot\nWho took care of the family and I thought how grand would it be to have a robot I never have to make my bed and you know nothing I we'd have a robot that would do that\nAnd I and I still feel like I Want a robot\nUntil I saw the state yesterday on the world Wide Web\nOh my gosh I you know this is a videos will video thing and it's hard to describe these things on the radio but there is a robot being developed right now by Boston Dynamics they they have their way ahead of everybody in the world and development of these robots\nNow just a year or two ago if you looked at pictures of their robot\nIt was a stumbling bumbling mess it could barely stay upright it could barely walk they had one that sort of like a little dog if anyone would constantly move and that one was doing OK but the one that looked like a human was upright on two feet\nIt was a mess it was falling over he was breaking all the time and that was just like a couple of years ago that they this thing was barely mobile now it is completely self sufficient\nAnd it can do back flips\nAnd it can do park core park or is that that that uh you know where the people jump up and down off buildings and stuff like that this thing\nAnd if you've seen this video and if you don't just go to that just go to the Web and look up Boston Dynamics you'll see what I'm Talking about this thing is super human and its strength\nAnd now all of a sudden I'm rethinking the whole thing about do I really want a robot\nI mean this thing looks intimidating list thing looks scary this thing looks like it you know it could crush me like a bunker\nAnd so I mean I'm telling ya there aren't any wires there aren't any cables like it used to be in the old days\nThese things are walking around completely self sufficient jumping over boxes of stepping over logs or doing park ... up and down a big old series of steps these steps by the way are about ... about two and a half feet tall each one I'm Scott bam bam bam right up I'm just like nothing [noise]\nSo I'm not sure ladies and gentlemen as I'm rethinking whether or not I want my robot now I mean I think they're impressive to see but what you really want one of those things jumping around your house\nTaking care of you [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nComes the robot I'm telling you just go back and look at this thing dear lord what just happened did you see
