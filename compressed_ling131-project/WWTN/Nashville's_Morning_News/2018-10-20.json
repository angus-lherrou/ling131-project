food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting all lost you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah

should really be aware of this because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing to do their little drip little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you know to the point where they don't

I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes you than us before they're fed so they could sleep well and they wake up in their mothers' we're in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication so many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium and the system so that very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body and experience and because of the fish and in many of

you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point seven eight percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there\nAnd the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside

could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWell he has diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin in the body but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D three does is it takes that problem\nAnd it seems to fix it now they've studied vitamin D three and it didn't prove this

why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of\nVitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the the three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith my self and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids short development and the humidity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn it on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones him to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning ...\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on to the formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done ... clarity you know this is the more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pink is such that your fast melt do three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath of the mirror in the morning and then you know that you're

can get on my formula better eyes you're going to have of having a really healthy high energy high mobility life from here on out\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting just working

it\nUm I think it took about five ibuprofen total for for reconstructive ACL knee surgery is rough\nBut anyway so I Am ACL done and um the problem was is obviously there's a lot of information that happens with any type of surgery and when they did that a ... wind up tightening that joined back almost like tighter than what it was originally I'm so just you know even some walking causes a little bit of inflation in my knee\nAnd it was really interesting for about a full year I got to understand the power of information and that was like if I ate a cookie him because again grain sugars those

corn syrup it's in our sodas and it will kill you met is so deadly for a cause inflation your arterial wall um it causes cancer cells as a matter of fact there's eight times as many receptor sites for\nUm sugar on a cancer cell is a regular cell that's why when you go to get a cancer stand on a PET scan what they do is actually inject you with radioactive sugar\nAnd that radioactive sugar find his way to guess what your cancer cells\nAnd then gives off that radiation so they can tell you where the cancer is because cancer loves sugar so obviously not only does it cause inflammation it spurs

seen some incredible successful the predators retirement planning is really no different and there there are seven steps that we feel like as a firm\nThat you need to consider as you approach this whole issue of retirement\nAnd potentially being able to\nRetire sooner than what you thought possible in the first step fever going to get into these in in the additional segments today\nBut the first that we just kind of want to summarize them\nNothing's going to happen without a plan yeah I mean having a plan and you talk about back to college football or any type of\nA a sporting event you have to have a plan to know that you're going to win and if anything you want to win and its retirement\nUh I actually came across this subject as we build out this uh topic for today\nA in a Forbes article that had come out entitled seven steps to retirement reading is so obviously it caught my eye and these are the kinds of things that we've been preaching in teaching to our people and we continue to will do it again next year the year after five years from now ten years from now\nThese things don't get all their so so important nothing happens without a plan every family needs to have a plan and it needs to be well\nI doubt it doesn't need to be a hope so and that may be and I think so and then they don't need to be winning it they need to have a written playing like John if you're going on a vacation and you map out and planned out a trip\nExactly where you're going to ... you said you're going to Dali would I mean there's preparation beforehand about where are we going to stay and this is this place going to have enough room for the kids to run crazy and wild\nAnd or maybe not get hurt too badly and things are going to be any room where you can kind of pull off and be silent for a moment or walk in the woods\nYou have to have a plan of how you're going to get somewhere what you're going to do where are you going to say all these kinds of things that just a vacation that could last a few days to a week or two\nWell it's a couple of things that you know number one my wife is a teacher so she has a plan for everything\nNumber two um I had planned on walking in the woods ... for a couple of days that I heard about some people that ran into a couple of bears just the other day so I'm not the fastest growing world I figure that won't that's not going to work out to us we're probably going to stay out of the woods but we do have a plant\nAnd you're right and the second step is in retirement is developing a pre determined income strategy you know I was singing with a couple just this last week and um we had met several times in we'd began to implement the plan and in the meantime the wife had retired five or six years ago and the husband has just recently retired\nAnd and I could I could feel that there was this tension in the room and and I finally just looked at him and I said okay a bottom and that's not their names its will come what what are you sensing what are you feeling he said\nHe looked at me and he said I just realize we're not getting a paycheck anymore and he says the first time I haven't got a paycheck and thirty eight years and he said John I'm scared to death and I said well the ... the good news is you've been responsible and you said and I said we've we've got an income plan and I was able to go through and show them exactly where\nThey were going to get their income from if they live ten years Twenty years Thirty years and then of course that brought a lot of peace of mind but Pete how many people do you know\nThey're retired that don't have an income plant just about everybody I mean when they come in they don't have one that's right and and they just essentially transfer their money into some funds with no formal life plan in terms of how they're going to get into them so you want to have a plan you want to have a pre determined in complain the third step is creating a strategy for minimal\nTaxes in retirement

track\nThree zero zero zero [noise]\nLooking back on John max in here with the fence and you're listening to beacon retirement strategies radio show and we've been\nTalking about today seven steps to retirement readiness this comes out of a Forbes article that Pete and I had read\nNot long ago and these are seven critical steps and so we're unpacking these things because the truth is a lot of people out there in fact you were talking about earlier that a third of people in America don't think they'll ever be able to retire and that's a travesty that really is if you want to keep working\nBecause you enjoy what you do that's one thing but to not think that you can retire literally a third of our population that's the tragedy so\nHow can you make sure you're in the two thirds of the retires the way that you want to retire and support your life so you need to have a plan and that's the first step in these seven steps\nIn a plan begins with understanding what you have right now and is it suitable inappropriate for the stage of life you're in you have the appropriate risk and that type of thing or your investments going to do for you what you think they're going to do for you and the only way you find that out is to have some research done for you and for that to be able to be proven out\nA through D good advice or um the second step\nThat we talked about was making sure that you have an income strategy it does matter\nWhether or not you have a source of income during market fluctuations reality is that the market will go up the market will go down which you don't want to be in ... in retirement is is a retiree that has to sell a bunch of security during the downturn because markets eventually come back\nNo question about that and if you have solid income those market volatility seasons that we see their their weathered a whole lot better on your behalf of\nYou have a solid income plan and so few people have that so now we get into this next segment here ... we're going to start with the third step\nAnd I'll tell you this is a big one that this is a huge step there's never been a better time to address this and this is creating a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement now most people think that in retirement you're doctrines have gone away you can't do a lot about taxes but\nWe believe in and believe we can prove this to people in retirement unfortunately people do less planning but they have more control over how much they pay in taxes in retirement than probably any other point of their life absolutely so you need to create a strategy for minimal\nTaxes in retirement that's the best time to pay the least amount of taxes and you can but only if you have a strategy that looks ahead three years ten years Fifteen and Twenty years the earlier you begin this strategy the better\nBecause through the tax reform act um these individual tax rates that we have now we're taxes or\nLiterally on sale and your your bandwidth is wider that you can make a higher income still stay in the same bracket there's opportunities for Ross conversions and other types of tax strategies that you need to take advantage of and each year that goes by and you don't you've missed out on that because these things are going to end in six to seven\nYears so the earlier began the better you need a forward looking tax strategy not one that looks back and re acts but one that's proactive and you need to think about required minimum distributions\nUh they're all taxable and it could double your tax burden and it's like a domino effect how day which you have to take\nHave effect on taxes on Social Security and all those kinds of things so you need to have a plan for this and what is your plan right now whoever you're working with are they talking to you about this and developing a plan\nThat might be possible for you to pay less in taxes are you getting all the pieces of their retirement puzzle that's very very important the beacon retirement blueprint that we utilize\nOne of the five pillars is having a tax strategy so what's holding you back from retiring right now well probably the fact that you don't have yet attack strategy\nWell and let me tell you why this is so big I was talking to a couple and we'll call them a bill in in Tammy not build him enough to ... we were talking just said that they had about one point three million an IRA and some other assets said worked really hard and we started talking about taxes and\nAnd I said you know a year and a great position you put money away and you saved and sacrifice than wise has said but that comes with some unfortunate news and that kind of looked at me confused and I said you know you've got this IRA that you've got about one point three million is a that's the good news the bad news is it's not all yours\nAnd they looked at me somewhat confused and he said what do you mean that's not all money goes we we worked for that we say for that said yes but\nYou didn't save taxes you deferred them\nAnd ... as you start to take money out of account what do you have to do and he kind of looked at me and shrugged and said well I I have to pay taxes I sit right\nIn taxes are like a debt and so what we did and we have some actuary software so the suffer was written by a friend of ours ... who's a renowned actuary so its factual and we can take that IRA or that defer to counter the total here tougher to counts and we can\nTake your current tax bracket and we can show you what your tax burden is going to be\nOn that money over your lifetime through required minimum distributions and re invested record minimum distributions and then at that\nAnd I will tell you that for most people it is an eye opening experience you know what the number was for him was over seven hundred thousand dollars wow what a one point three million dollar IRA which may seem unbelievable\nPlease show your support and text V.

about\nRetirement renting is how in the world can you truly be ready for retirement and um will you be working forever or maybe just think you will what's holding you back right now\nHere the seven steps here the seven things that you need to take care of nothing will happen without a plan so you have to have a solid plan then you need to have a pre determined and developed income strategy\nThen you need to create a strategy for minimal taxes in retirement gay and create a strategy for for withdrawing funds from your Iranian four one K. and what order how do you do that sequence of withdrawals\nAnd then create a strategy for optimizing your Social Security I Want to squeeze out every possible dollar that I can and now we're on to number six and seven number six John is\nPlanned for a long retirement yeah well you know it's pretty common nowadays Pete to sit down with people\nThat are had been retired longer than they were working ... my my grandmother is one of those people should be Ninety five and a few months or her husband was Ninety four last about five or six years ago my other grandmother passed away the same years my grandfather he was he was Ninety seven\nSo people are living a lot longer today you know and so you want to plan for longevity and there's a lady Emma Emma ... she was a hundred and Seventeen years young so voters Seventeen from Italy she died in April of two thousand and Seventeen you know what her\nDiet was a no but uh you\nTold me to eggs the arcade allergic to eggs one raw and ... every day in and cookie and a cookie and now I didn't go through the mail raw egg\nAnd in a few veggies thrown in so you know if you live to your upper eighties guys and you know men today will sometimes lab there so I'm not going to live that long well\nNone of us are promised tomorrow but even men are living longer today and women definitely if you look at longevity studies are living well into their nineties\nOh I have a couple over in Mount Juliet and family maybe listening on the radio\nStay but the the mom who was Ninety four just died but the husband outlived or he's he's still alive these Ninety three years old now he's he's still here but he's not as old as she was yet another year he will be and so I mean men do live into their into their ... even sometimes into their hundreds\nYeah so the question is how long will your income last will your money last as long as you do\nAnd can you account for inflation on that and so really when you talk about planning for a long retirement you want to plan for a good long retirement\nAnd how do you plan for a good long retirement you want to make sure that someone has done a longevity study where your income is sustainable it goes up with inflation you know talking to a guy recently who said you know\nWe're taking the same amount of money is out today as it were ten years ago but just doesn't seem to go so far well the reason as it goes far as because of inflation and so you want to really plan for hopefully what will be a very healthy and long retirement for you and or your significant other\nBecause people are living longer and it's a it's a huge mistake not to do that and the uh this last point I was you know I Want to park on some today because I think now given where the market is some of the volatility we've seen and just as high as there's there's probably never been a better time to be talking about this next point and that is that your plan\nShould match your risk profile and that is a key an important question here's what you can expect to get from us the first thing we're going to do\nIs we're going to work up a customized retirement income plan that uses proven strategies that uses techniques that that are meant to give you confidence in your retirement income whether that's now are down the road everybody wants confidence in their retirement income the next thing we're going to do as a detailed stress tests\nAnd this is where we're going to look at the current risk in your portfolio that is really vital right now do you have too much risk do you have two little risk that can be both ways but if you have too much risk and you're close to retirement or you're in retirement now's the time that you need to know that\nThen what we're going to do is we're going to run a the report where we're going to show you how much you're paying for the investments you have and this is Ken tend to be an eye opening experience because many times people are paying much more than they should be or need to be and then the tax analysis\nAgain you can never avoid taxes completely but if you could reduce them if you could be a fish and in taxes and keep more money in your pocket and your family's pocket\nOr would that be a good thing fees and taxes in our opinion are the biggest the ease of your hard earned money and you need to have a strategy to pay less that's just absolutely critical in short or trying to do is take the gas work out a financial planning for you and your family so pick up the phone\nRight now give us a call six one five three nine five three thousand again that number is six one five\nThree nine

got a real simple question I got a check in July on oh six\nChevrolet Colorado in mind five edit tested at a local uh parts store it showed up they owed to singer ... as a the ... center on it I can see the sensor I can see the wiring a ball to censor\nWhat what I looked at changing it I wasn't sure how if I could actually do that or the videos that I was watching city very difficult 'cause it would tend to be frozen\nI don't know whether to approach it from the top the engine or it has to be done from under they give me some insight on changing an oath to censor\nSnow much inside that one too [laughter] either actually very simple yeah some of them are really simple and then sometimes you do get stuck but you know it just depends on the vehicles been up north along I mean miles to the hands on it and not to correct you but do you have more\nOne center yeah yeah it is a\nWatering when you've got an upstream downstream ... was your code do you remember\nI don't remember but I can see the sensor that code indicated somebody actually it's visible\nYet Dakota who the definitions like bank one central won ... circuit problem or something I'm Sorry is it like a heater circuit problem with the center\nI don't know I'm just getting a check engine light\nThat Novak what showed up yeah yeah oh you can do is try yeah they do\nThat yet here's the problem with the whenever you get a code that tells you this is the issue\nIt's not saying this is the issue it's actually saying there's an issue in this area\nRight so it could be a ground problem it could be able to censor it could be a false code that the computer's given off because there's something going on with a different part of the car so a lot of people do think that oh the ... you know the computer tells us exactly what's wrong\nUm it actually does not it just points out there is a symptom and then we still have to diagnose from there but I Will tell you that\nThose are two sensors are most of the time aren't as bad as I think a lot of people make them sound I think the reason they're made to be like that is you know al ... out in the Internet is they don't have lives like auto repair shops do right and so it's hard to get in there I mean I Can't imagine lane and my driveway by car on ramps\nAnd trying to know those things lose because they do get stuck as long as you're on the ground\nAnd then you can you know put a a a lot of leverage to it you're going to be fine\nAnd then if you can choose you up with a ... real quick and then you ... it's not a major thing but if I was in my driveway it would be empty chairs [laughter] but it wasn't the\nBest approaches from other night that's what you're saying\nThat yeah I mean well we have a cabinet under the hood it's totally different and if the cat's underneath the cars and yeah but it just depends on what I don't know what kind of car you've you've got as far as where the catalytic converters located I mean so remember\n... ... it's on the passenger side right\nRight and it's under the hood yeah can actually see it on an upward you can get on the wiring and everything you can see where that study\nIs it down like ... ... where the exhaust pipes down low at the bottom line engine\nWhy if it's an insult actually I'm a mouthful actually\nRight now yeah you should should be able to get to hear from Tom\nIn jail too okay well uh we're\n... we're so sorry worst case scenario if you get a singer or the to sock it on you know they do make a special socket port yes I Know that there is at a high enough it sounds like that doesn't want to do it because at soccer is burning\nWere higher was just took the wires to censor why put any um national ... regular sock it on in ...\nAnd if it won't come lose when it's cold starts the
