putting in a Hilton garden in a gal turns very excited to have their conference center and he'll most likely adds some condominiums and for sure restaurants as well yeah uh and then a final one that we're working on at the moment is called ... farms it's an existing development as well\nBut we're going to continue to build that out in the back and again the city was very helpful in guiding us in getting to where we are now and that projects to start in the next two or three months\nI think once again it's it's a trend I mean obviously for for larger cities is is something that's definitely not new but kind of the idea of you've got retail restaurants living space whether it's condos town homes even a residential homes a commercial office space all within walking distance of each other so you create these\nCommunities where you live work and play literally in a in a small area and I think obviously it's using the land strategically to the best use to to be able to build density\nBut I think that's something that you're starting to see obviously heavily here in Nashville and middle Tennessee what's your take on those sort of things in terms of keeping your eye on\nIt does sort of trends and tying those into these opportunities as well\nThe cities have been very helpful and re zoning when they see that that's going to benefit their their citizens in a case in point is the gal and project\nAnd the gal to project was known for commercial initially uh there's a lot of light industrial behind us but they saw the importance of bringing a residential component to that area\nSo when we went down and sat with the planning board they agreed that we know from a let's put it in these town homes is putting these condos\nWill have the hotel right next door we have a super Walmart across the street for which ah we have a crosswalk coming in to cross Belvedere\nAh so you will be able to walk to the super Walmart which can sell your grocery so you won't have to get in the car and drive or so in in ... in particular and ... and they've they've been very helpful and and and uh willing to get us in there to change is only ... only as is difficult you know people\nAre when you and I buy a house we say okay you know we don't expect a an oil plant to come in next door or something that's not his own that's not known for that but in this case everyone kind of agreed that this was a a good thing for the property\nSo let's talk about ... would be I think there's another thing that's a really neat is heavily involved in a lot of a film property initiatives\nUm civic wise rotary got the barbecue rodeo empty su land development residential building construction management board goodwill construction program and you've got a lot going on that plate so\nTalked about why it's so important I think it goes off a that you know for what you do your community builders um but but talk about um the philanthropic side of the heart of service and being in ... in the fabric of the community\nSo I ... coming from the university I was very involved in a in philanthropy and I will readily admit that as I came out and started working it dwindled and so as I made my way up to Nashville one of the promises that I made myself are demands that I made myself was to re insert\nA my time into ... and civic activities right away ah got into the rotary\nOr they have been a wonderful and it's the Franklin noon rotary and as you mentioned they have the Franklin rodeo but it's not going into a Seventy year\nOr last year we made a hundred and five hundred and sixty thousand for the community and it's the organizations we donate to we also donate to some international organizations\nAnd then the other big event is the barbecue festival a which made approximately forty\nTo forty five thousand this year and it's only it's thirty or so that it has exploded in terms of its growth so we hope to get it up as high as a as as the rodeo\nA as someone who is not from here that's one of the ways that you can show that you you love your new community that you want to be welcomed with open arms uh so you know being in the rotary has offered that and at the same time as allowed me to fulfill that dream of getting involved in community again\nI'm the residential land development board perfect fed like you said it's it's a business I'm In it's wonderful we get to be involved with the students there there's nothing more uh exciting them being with the students and see what they're seeing on the leading edge\nOf our own business because in construction many times we don't we're not up to date on the new technology and what's going on but when you get involved with these students you start seeing these things so it's definitely a two way street had regard\nNow and then finally in the goodwill program or they have that the construction program which takes people and actually pays them while they old while they are learning\nOr to get certified in in basic construction safety and procedures\nAnd then from there they help us get them jobs so it's a soup to nuts project that they're actually paid for it to be trained so it's a wonderful project and the way we've helped them the most is to connect them with other\nStakeholders in Nashville or especially suppliers of construction material that's their biggest single line item is the would the nails and things of that nature so trying to reduce that cost and make the program as successful as possible is where we've plugged in\nWell I think you know some of the things that we talk about an ongoing basis with uh the show and just the media and everything we do with the current general is\nUsing your skill sets strategically so it's one thing to go out and I'm ... and do the litter pick out and then be plugged in from a physical standpoint but when you started like you said aligning especially with the college students are aligning with your expertise and your industry to be able to strategically help and move the needle\nOr whether that's through mentor ship guided or your jobs and opportunities and creative element of all of those those become huge synergy where you get to see your expertise align but then nine to five opportunities for others in a very very large way so I think it's really cool to look out okay what am I good at\nHow do I align that with a higher purpose and ultimately benefit the lives of others\nI mean ... you know we all get involved in France and our jobs we put our heads down would try to do the best we can\nBut like you said to lift your head up and share a is should be it should be a goal that we all have and it's very fulfilling you know when we go out and we share and people learn from us that you you feel good about what you're doing so again a little self serving but it goes a long way to help everybody out\nA little bit kudos for you to for recognizing coming in and they wait a second this is the missing component of my life I Want to make it a priority not just for me personally professionally as well and I think many times people might\nHave an inkling that wait a second something's missing I I'd I don't feel is filled a missing that purpose of being able to tie in and help somebody else\nFor the right reasons and by identifying that button making it a priority is what they did if I Would tend to make it a priority and say no I Am going to carve out the time I Am going to make this\nA priority to do this that's where I think the the real magic is taking the steps that making it ultimately a priority to do it versus just saying\nTalking about a year and um you know for for what you do and obviously for those who just want to get in this business kinda carrying it that thread for what advice would you give them that is going through the program it for those who say I want to get in this construction does I Want to get in kind of the land survey I Want to get into the this sort of industry in general\nWhat would you recommend for them in terms of a mentor ships programs where to start\nEducation being the foundation for this I in high school there are opportunities to take courses that have to do with the trades whether you're going to continue on with that trade or whether you plan on being in a management position that is definitely an excellent gateway for someone to get involved\nWhen you are a looking at someone's resume to see that they have that foundation of okay I was on the line and I was working and I was framing or doing things of that nature you know than what\nThe guy that's hammering the nail is doing as opposed to have just come in and been told managerial a you know this is what we need to do make sure you check these boxes going from there in college there are programs in the U.S including specially empty us use which is wonderful\nThat are geared towards construction management so if you would like to be involved in the industry find a program that does have that particular degree\nThe transition into I'm getting that internship that you talk about you'll open a lot more doors if you've got that\nBase and then say okay I'm I'm going to go here and do this construction and you get in there and you cannot replace the experience that you have when you're when you have the internship everyone gets their foundation at school but the internships are are absolutely mandatory\nYeah the real world application you can't put a price tag on cyclists Armando ... managing partner for ... Asset Management and as we wrap up tell us where they can go to learn more Maine where where would you direct is whether it's phone number online social media where where should we go to learn more\nTo learn more about our company and go to try star am dot com and then we also a use are linked in page to receive information\nIn terms of a connecting with people in the industry were always ready and able to do that so even if you don't think that you're looking to work with us or for us if there's a question you have would be glad to answers\nWebsite again is try star am dot com so a mixture and check them out Armando thanks for all you're doing really appreciate them\nI don't want you to tell my\nFedEx delivery patch what we term that her bike and laughing\nOr life with Dr Sanjay

statement think children should ride and we're facing seat until they reach the height and weight when it more than ...\nPain and she's not alone I recently spoke to a group and I remember asking the ladies in her room you know just out of curiosity how many of you in this room or a girl scout\nI'm about two thirds of the room set up my oh wow how many in this room participated in the cookie program well about two thirds of them are still standing up\nAnd that's it and how many of you weren't influenced by that cookie program to bring you to the professional place that you are today\nIt was astounding the numbers stories and I don't think that as we do our work every year working with the girls here in middle Tennessee that we ... we just don't ever realize the impact\nBecause keep in mind we had these girls for a short window of time in their lives they go on to college and universities they go on to careers and families of most of the time isn't until years later when they come back and they say remember me\nUh I remember when I got from this experience I remember how it impacted my life I remember that if I had not done this I Would not be doing this right and if that is really the greatest joy of this word\nUm is bringing them back or them coming back and telling us what has happened in their lives not only from their girls got experience for how their Girl Scout experience really set them up for the future experiences in their life\nGive us maybe one or two of your ... like pick a child you can't pick your favorite but maybe a couple of uh programs um or experiences that you do each year that you think that the public definitely needs to know about these\nUm [noise] so that we're doing right now um I think I'm most emotionally tied to as a problem we have called Girl Scout troop six thousand um this is the Girl Scout troop that serves girls who are living in homeless shelters\nSo as you can imagine this is a very fragile population of children of girls and we thought you know we have a really good program model here if we can find the right leader who's willing to commit\nAnd I do mean commit to serve girls that are I'm living in a homeless situation\nJust imagine what sparked that might bring 'em to their to their life um and that spark has indeed happened I it was something that we wanted to try not knowing how it would go a fast forward it has gone extremely well the stories that we're getting from the holes\nIn their experiences the pride\nUm it brings such pride for them to say that they are part of a community\nIn this community for them this Girl Scout so that's one program um that I don't think a lot of people know about that we are as an organization support funded underwrite one hundred percent off because we just believe that if every girl has an opportunity to be a girl scout just like the story you just told\nThat maybe she'll come back and tell us how we were able to make that pivot in her life so we're really excited about that one and I do want more and more people know that\nGirl Scouts and middle Tennessee is here to serve all thirty nine counties and all the girls in those thirty nine counties including girls for maybe in a homeless shelter that's awesome so that's one\nI'm another program um that were extremely proud of ... is our equestrian program girls love horses um and has been no secret girls love horses but to have a horse and to have\nA horseback riding experience are and we've all gone horseback riding on trails before it's not an an expensive undertaking\nAt All right but you know again middle Tennessee is a very philanthropic community cookies all show up in several locations throughout the middle tendency district troop leaders and girls come pick up those ... and then they started distributing them and delivering them to the consumers\nBut another way that we do do that program is that we do have girls who do do cells to businesses and corporations that organizations and we loved that especially when a business will call\nAnd say you know would you have a girl scout troop comes set up in our lobby and we'll find the troupe best best match for that business and we'll let them set up in their life and we have several businesses that do that we would love to have more\nBecause it provides a really good environment because when it's in a setting in life that\nThe employees are usually more engaged I eat it asks the girls more questions they're more curious about them and help us better build at home the skills that the girls gain\nSo that is one area we would like to see more companies in business is calling us insane gay you have a girl scout troop come set up in our lobby and sell cookies for a couple of hours a day\nUm but the program has done is duty ah we probably filtered back into our community over a million dollars a year and Girl Scout troop accounts and then they take that money and move forward making their dreams come true\nYeah I mean that's where I wanted to understand that\nYou know the cookies while they taste delicious and they are amazing gift and they serve a higher purpose so um go ahead and and let's wrap up and tell listeners when you talked about getting involved we obviously financial contributions the cookies of volunteerism there's so many ways that the public can help and get involved with Girl Scout for middle Tennessee\nAnd our efforts are every year to bring in girls who haven't had a girl scouts experience or to serve the girls who are loving their Girl Scout experience\nBut we're constantly looking for those girls who want to have a girl scout experienced the things they don't have the resources to do that so the good news about Girl Scouts and middle Tennessee is that regardless of where you are and what your family situation is\nAh we never tell a girl no so we're excited about what we do here never tell a girl now so we're excited about what we do here and uh and hope to do it another hundred years\nIt it's really cool to how you are engaging those women who've gone through Girl Scouts but um I I think that's another piece of this is so many have have gone through the program and I'm might or might not have a touch point\nI Know that's a big piece of this to his re engaging them in bringing people back into the fold and and and making this a really exciting next hundred years for\nHim yeah and this is fascinating to to sort of watch what's happening yes we get a lot of moms who are Girl Scouts who want to give their daughter a girl scout experience but we have a lot of women and our community like you know just want to learn more about you and figure out how I can make a difference in a girl's life\nSo girl scouting truly is a mentoring program a is where we get adults who volunteer as troop leaders um those adults and we recommend one or two or three of them pairing up\nOn decided to take on a group of girls and they use the Girl Scout program as a guide to the ... relationship that they have these girls so we do have a lot who were a girl scout we have a lot who were not Girl Scouts\nBut are curious about what we do want to understand better how we do but truly want to make a difference in a girl flight so they'll sign up and volunteer as well I just just reach out to us a favorite way to do that is of course go

three pronged to treatment surgery chemotherapy and radiation all three have seen major advances in the past few years but the key it's\nIn other words with any sort of problem there's a lot of other pieces that play a role and so you can't just tackle one without being holistic and looking at the others and how they all are intertwined right and that's exactly what you're talking about is absolutely and get involved in one area without being involved in the others\nAbsolutely and that's why a lot of a lot of our agencies now like our police department is actually working\nIn a child it happens to the president went a say a domestic violence incident happens we now have a a program where automatically from that incident a report is is sent to that child school so that the teacher the next day understands why\nAh Tommy maybe one falling asleep in class or acting out in class and and so yes you get to the root of why it's happening so that maybe you can help diverted and and not make it a path that has followed\nWould even that communication sharing information so that the teacher to your point because the teachers are very easily could get mad at him not understand the situation and say why are you for the worse\nDisaster baby the problem went in to your point if she's arm or the teachers armed with the information to understand and have some empathy for what time he's going through all of a sudden now you create um you create water more loving society would too is you you gain a better appreciation for the child is dealing with\nAnd you have that empathy so that you're not making the problem worse you're actually stepping in was carrying his her and say hey you know what I understand is probably difficult last night was let's get through this together imagine if that's the situation that child's going through but that's the reaction the teacher has because the teachers armed with the information right so\nAbsolutely power information is Kate yeah and and not being alone is another thing I mean whenever\nA again somebody goes through any kind of situation where that made the child that we were just talking about or even an adult you feel very powerless and out of control and uh for your home life and and perhaps somebody to say\nHey I'm of what's going on you know and not not having to go through it alone is in very impactful right there\nSo how how can we help because obviously to do what you do [laughter] funding is a piece of this obviously being a non profit of being able to have the donations to underwrite the costs of the services extremely important how else can the public help\nWe have a number of ways that can help obviously donations there's a pretty obvious ones we are always looking for volunteers who want to be trained to do and um do some of these programs or if you have a group that would like us to come out and talk and start the conversation within your group we can do that\nWe also have to fundraising events and the second one is coming up November fifteenth\nAt the cabana here in Nashville they call it powerfully thankful and that's one of my favorite uh events of the year that we do\nIt's of very laid back and very joyous uh we get that some of the uh community artist will come in and and letting their voice and their songs to us we have an online auction and it's basically just it's at the beginning of the holiday season\nAnd it just helps us focus and to be thankful for our own life and what we're able to do\nThat and you got some amazing um auction items you Scott Charlie Daniels autograph of federal I mean that's really cool absolutely a region scream bike you got\nA beach condo for a week and then she got some really cool stuff that obviously um our auction items to serve the purpose in the mission of what you do so you know we've got plenty of ways that people can get plugged in the river so obviously the auction\nYeah we love the auction\nAnd it's going to be on line so if you can't make it to the event that you really want to become a Charlie Daniels' next civil player [laughter] uh ... you can do that because you can bid on line\nAnd that will be ah up and running and you can continue it and say you don't have to be present to win necessarily\nAlso we do have some very cool ... items up for auction as you mentioned but we also have just some very practical things like gift cards the your favorite restaurant um [noise] a lot of people come in and buy those items for Christmas gifts etcetera so you can get a get a jump on your holiday shopping too\nHigh and that have been Thursday November Fifteen five thirty to eight PM um as you mentioned that you do have the auction on line so that people can start enjoying that right now where do they go when it comes to tickets information where would you directly over\nThere on the auction line there is it a button that you can push if you want to purchase tickets or you can go to why H. T. P. dot org and purchase tickets on line\nSo obviously the initials for you have the power so why H. T. P. dot org\nI'm Talking about on your end you know when it comes to you mentioned the training and and those and you don't necessarily have to I mean obviously don't name names but give us a success story that stands out for you obviously shows what you do why do it in the impact your having\nWell again lately get this random phone calls and we didn't have to direct services um we um are sort of the grounds keepers and and the first first responders in in this regard and somebody will call and one of the successes we had as we had a woman call\nAnd she was just remembering a\nSexual felt that it happened to her well she was in college\nAnd now her daughter was getting ready to go to college and then she had she had never told her daughter about it or or whatever and we were able to work with her find hard to services she was able to tell her daughter her daughter is obviously surprised they're also empowered her her daughter has now gone on to help\nTrain other women who are going through college is on on safety aspects\nAnd so I think that's a really good example of we've just moving the circle further\nAbsolutely well and and giving people the the tools and the confidence to have very difficult conversations into your point you know and I think right now you're seeing this movement definitely take place but\nPeople for so long buried that\nAnd we'd go through a very traumatic circumstance and bury it versus now coming out sharing it empowering others and hopefully preventing it from happening to anyone else etc like her daughter\nAbsolutely nobody wants to see someone they love\nAnd pain and ... and sometimes that people will say well don't you hate talking about this all the time and it's not really I I Can't wait for the time when it's not necessary but\nYou know when you were little you wanted to cross the street but it can be dangerous to cross the street or mom taught you the right way to do it and now you cross the street safely and that's how I see what we did\nYeah so what's again let's wrap up until a listeners where to go to learn more I mean you are on social media but the website again why H.

correspondent in some places now for years restaurants have been posting calorie counts on their menu back in may it became a nationwide requirement that chain restaurants with twenty or more locations posting calorie counts now and he said he had a Cornell shows posting calorie counts\nOn menus really does result in customers ordering left\nOut a lot less just three percent laugh about forty five ...\nInterestingly people cut back on calories when it comes to appetizers and entrees but not with drinks and deserts the study's authors says\nEven if you're an educated person who eats out a lot in his aware of nutrition there can still be some surprising thing these calorie counts what's more he says there's no downside for restaurants revenue profit labor costs all remain

attack on one community of faith in Pennsylvania is an attack against every community ... seats in Pennsylvania six people\nSo that might make you wonder if the train of migrants that is now in the news day after day after day is and in fact the first move of the twenty twenty election\nYeah and as you reflect on that and think you wonder what's the endgame what's the play here because if that's the case to the people that are supportive of that think that that's going to get them votes in the short term or is it a long term strategy\nI think there are for the long haul and I don't think this will be the first care of and this is actually not the first game but I think it's going to be one of many many many many caravan\nWell and this is indicative as to why it is very important that we address\nThe problem of\nOr immigration laws which are not being enforced we have plenty of laws on the books to enforce our immigration laws and there's plenty of good will around this table that his desire is for people who want to come here to make space for them\nAnd that's been nothing in our approach says we're against people coming here we need people and and I tell you we love people in America and we want people who want to be free to come to America our vision hasn't changed my\nMy daughter in law's not from this country ... look when she was born and raised in another country and yet she is coming here get this legal Lee and that's the point is it how many ... would there be in this country\nSo that was already ... at least one too many right all my grandparents came over on a boat and I'm very grateful that America\nAnd I have a debt to that to this country because of that permission so\nThere's nothing that anti immigration around this table but what's important is that people recognize if you don't have a border as a country you don't have a country no more nation state and in a country that is rep built upon the consent of the government and proportional representation and all the attending responsibilities that come with being free\nYou've got to you got to know what you're doing here folks but one thing leads to the next it's like a domino effect and you just can't say well forget all those details let's just do it ... it doesn't work that way you got to be grown up here\nYou've got to be growing up and I do not want to get involved in being part of the caricature stereotype game I say everyone who wants to come here and be free should have a shot but we've got to do it fair and that means we've got to do it by law\nAnd that means we've got to pay the laws or else it's going to be mass chaos\nAnd and I'm not interested in mass chaos I think people that believe it open borders and like people who endorsed the open society a type organizations they are interested in gas because they basically want to transform America from a constitutional representative republic to a mass democracy ah that's not what we're about\nWe also need to be concerned about some other matters it's not just about letting people in who want to be free yes I Want people who are honest and hardworking didn't want to contribute to country to come here or however we live in a world of terrorism\nWe live in a world of drug trafficking human trafficking we have to be concerned about that and screen people carefully\nBut let's hit the pause button will come back to this conversation twenty twenty just began what are some more signs that that's true [noise] we'll talk about that next year in the ... where we are on line with this program and many others that you want to listen to include in our daily version two minute version\nFound at the public square dots\n\nOn the public square\nIn letting things there's our time including budget gaps in all the insurance then\nWhere's the line in the budget that helped me to jail for Nixon was wrong in America a log on today and maybe round table that Oregon joined the growing team then giving every month to get America back on track\nMake your monthly contribution to Amy roundtable dot org [noise]\n\nReading the light is it is\n[noise] [noise]\nBack into the conversation around the table here the American policy roundtable still the square program for rebel gay you have to fly ball as\nWe look ahead to the midterms and twenty teen there's a lot of people that are looking past it and we've seen that twenty twenty has already began\nTo begin around the country and I think one of the reasons we know that is because if you look at some of the amusing air quotes here players for both parties let's let's look at where they went over the past month are they going to places that have key house and Senate races where some of them positioned themselves\nTo go to the states that will have the largest say in the twenty twenty primary election\nFor respect says party this is unfair this is our fair because Rob is the project manager if voters he has to live the two thousand at Eighteen election he's worked with over ten thousand candidate races that I've voters dot com he's\nBeen watching the numbers he's already got his decision desk for all the media that will be contacting him on election night including ours right and and and all of our friends and affiliates along the line and he's just wanting\nTo get to jump on twenty twenty he's already there are ... and feel it it's not fair I'm looking at out member all those videos we did for twenty sixteen in the primary I Do remember the day or about to do them again but bring up a very good point Rob the folks that\nWatch this stuff for a living there is an interesting thing going on we talked about a red wave we've talked about a blue label or we are a independent organization and I'm a registered independent\nUm as the c._e._o. of the corporation we fight to be fiercely independent we do not take money from candidates are campaigns we don't endorse candidates will tell you to vote for\nWe believe in the Republican and the principles upon which it stands the principles of the declaration of the constitution and the principles that are underneath those documents that's where we're coming from\nBut it's so blatantly obvious\nThat if there was going to be a race to the finish on this election that the people who are players\nIf you will on the Democrats' side would be furiously engaged in the states where race is still hang in the balance\nThe superstars of the Democrats' bench that are looking to become the first stringers in the presidential election so I went looking for and the other day when I was in Florida working out of our foreign office I couldn't find any of it and then we were in our Tennessee office I was looking for the American another key right\nCouldn't find him I went over to Pennsylvania couldn't find them over there because the dog gunner on South Carolina and suddenly I'm saying to myself\nWait a minute and they have some Iowa New Hampshire trips lined up as well exactly and then I heard that bill and Hillary decided to take a book tour together\nAnd I'm thinking to myself okay for them twenty twenty is already started now to be fair the\nPresident announced his reelection campaign I think three days after he was elected as a matter of fact it's not like they weren't getting started and to be fair the Obama group back in two thousand and ate the day after they were elected started their next campaign with their tech companies so it's not unusual for income but to start the next day\nBut my point is if you're watching and we love the people who listen to this program we'd there and we want you to know what we know so we don't come to you on the public square saying we're smarter than you so listen to us\nOur goal is let me tell you what we've discovered what do you think and what we think what we've discovered is they're moving there is a caravan of candidates and they're already on the move toward twenty twenty\nAnd we talk about not being on are lining ourselves with a team but there's clearly teams that are out there and it's been fun to watch the benches of the Democratic party trying align themselves to see where they fit in because right now that twenty twenty nomination is wide open\nI had a conversation with Michael do journal this morning on WGN in national flagship station in in the mid south and and uh he was saying upstate or is this going to win that she should do watch there's no way it'll be a reprisal Bernie Sanders is going to be the Democratic nominee because it's the ...\nIt's of what happened in the injustice of all I did habitable I thought man I really I don't see it I don't see that\nYeah there's so many that are lining up I mean you you have Kamala Harris Cory Booker I'm Bernie Sanders and not to plug Web sites but drudge had the headline the other day Hillary twenty twenty you know her her folks are talking about what it's going to the book tour you mentioned it it's a book\nTour why wouldn't they were selling Terry Elizabeth Warren why wouldn't\nThe Democrats unify early behind a single candidate why would they want to go through that primary process and beat one another's smithereens I mean that's what they've been doing for years wouldn't it make more sense\nWell that would take someone to step back and say I think you should do it and as we learn from the Republican primary and twenty sixteen\nBallot issues that happen in one state or coming to your state if they're successful whether that comes through the ballot or to the legislature or through the courts but these things matter particularly on drug laws you got because there is a movement afoot to change drug laws using ballot issues now the courts in the legislatures later so you've got to pay attention to this\nBut I'm Rob the good news is I've voters let you do your homework so for all of our wonderful listeners in Florida that are going I'm going out of my mind and got the sample ballot I got twelve questions I got to answer and that's before I get to the judge is\nIf you go on I voters you can get your homework done right\nYou can do all the research and we do this for a living and as I read through all the proposals\nI realized as I was helping some friends in Florida that a text message me\nThere's a lot to comprehend so make sure you go to the voters dot com enter your address than ZIP Code up all pop those ballot issue same for the folks are friends in North Carolina Ohio all states that ballot issues those will be up there for you to digest and take a look at before you go to the voting booth\nI I just went up punched in the ... office address this morning it was working through it with a radio station and it was incredibly helpful to be able to walk out loud you know our work out loud together saying okay here's where we are in these things\nOther question how much information actually appears in the ballot about the issue it seems like there's always just a brief summary there in most cases depends\nWhat state you live and most of the time it summary language\nAnd then it tells you what a yes vote doesn't ... does at every\nA voting location that I'm aware of they have to have the full text of the language posts a so they have to have it there for you to be able to read and to go through\nBut in in a number of states may just be summary language but practically who's going to take the time to do that while the rest of the ... that's why you have your smartphone and you can pull it by voters dot com right there\nWell who gets to write the summary language what if that was all somebody read and it would have it can they can that be colored are skewed at all it's a process in each state I'm Owen who writes it and it is a process\nUnder review so usually it's relatively objective but some states will actually also commission arguments for and against you and you can find that voters as well so the people that are putting up the measure put their best foot forward the people who are opposing it put the opposing argument and those are all very ... those are limited in word count and so you really do get it it it's a lot faster\nIf you can get it in one spot it's a lot quicker\nIf someone's listening for the first time they're hearing about voters they don't know what we mean when we say I voters rub just give us the details are real quick\nWay to enter your address in ZIP Code and up popped the information on your ballot for state rep all the way the United States Senate on the candidates that are on your ... as well as any statewide issues\nWe don't tell you who to vote for or how to vote you can visit campaign website you can visit profiles of people you can see what those people have done if they served in the past you can you take a look at everything for yourself\nAnd as we've said many times that address is important\nWhy do we need to know your exact street number and ZIP Code the reason the person across the street may have a ... different member of the state house or a member of Congress Neal Wayne shepherd\nRoll up early ... street is one district in across the street from us another ... that's ... exactly the situation we live in right yeah and we\nDon't mind the data we don't have advertisement we don't sell any of that it's just done to make an accurate representation of your ... and as a point when we don't ask you for your name we do not even have a space for you to put your name and we do invite you to participate with an email address if you choose to so you can get updates on polling times et cetera other than that\nYou are virtually anonymous there is no data mining and no uh no Evan we're not going to take advantage of of ours is we can't with programs and so we can't do it I think\nOne ... piece of voters is when you get to the home page you can look up endorsements organizations that have endorsed certain candidates it's fun to go in and look at its most liberal and progressive conservative moderate all kinds of organizations so you can see\nWho's paying and who who is the money behind it who are the people who are saying we want this person to represent our views that helps us sort through people I liked\nThe endorsement of as much as anything there's a lot of people have a certain couple of issues they care about the most and they can quickly define where a person stands but again that's not in our words that's in the organizations words and then the candidates records\nA number of folks have also come in and how they love the link to the federal election commission website and they can see where money is coming from who is actually writing checks to these candidates and supporting them because that makes you scratch your head when you look at some of the ...\nThere's also a key secret to our design that's the stick men on the blackboard and I am personally responsible for that and criticize merrily about it because I Want voting to feel like fourth grade [noise]\nI don't want it to be something that anyone says this is too hard for me because look coming out of anything brand new from a busy life and stopping and paying attention to something else is hard\nBecause you've got to make a commitment to commitment to stop and refocus is the challenge once you're there the information flows easily it's like okay two plus two equals four I get this okay I can do and if you only have to say like you were at the end of Europe you have Fifteen minutes are here's our criteria\nAre key primary person that's the intellect behind the software programming of this project to remains anonymous because we don't want anybody to know who he or she is who I frustrate our daily or are they are\nHas a rule that says if I Can't get my voting done in Fifteen minutes I won't vote therefore I must make this site valid\nIf all I'm willing to give is Fifteen minutes it will make me effective and help me be motivated to make a difference here and I've had discussions mineral yeah I'll have I'll\nEmail him and say I need this set up this way on the site and he'll respond and basically say well for someone like me that's looking at that that doesn't make any sense to set up that way I don't want to see it that way or the reason I like it is that\nYou don't have to get your information filtered by the media or filtered by the campaigns they're getting so much more in deeper information are you\nAnd now you know why the political consultants across the ...\nThey won't talk about I voters dot com um because they're not making Fifteen Percent off the advice or they're not in control this is empowerment to the people\nMore you learn something new every day and we still get an email or two I think I received two this year people that have went to I voter\nDot com nine plural knives are they went to a voter dot com and haven't put the s on there and I get those frantic emails you've been hacked something's wrong you know we haven't been hacked someone else owns I voter dot com we always inquire about the cost of that website and I will tell you it's well into five figures and that's the reason we haven't bought it yeah\nAnd how people have and and uh and tried to use it in fact\nHillary Hillary I obtained must be about Lisa twenty six five voters with an S. dot com so very important thank for bringing that I'm All right we're going to continue this conversation the public square um let's let's talk about the selection of church that's on the docket I have in front of me and will pick it up next on the public square\n\nBy this is David ... of the American policy roundtable\nDon't you like to have a backs on where the candidates stand before election day\nEvery single year for over thirty five years we work with voters across the nation and they tell us the same thing we want the vaccine we all want to know what the candidates stand on the issues and the good news is by voters dot com meats and write on\nVoters dot com it's an independent nonpartisan free voter information Serbian or you need to do is walk on and enter your address the sample ballot will appear racist that you'll see on election day from there you just click on each race candidate the issues pop up and you get the facts from both sides and then decide for yourself\nI voters dot coms fast trees independent it's waning right at your fingertips millions will have their ... election why not joined\nI voters dot com or free voter information service of the American policy roundtable\n... ... ...\n\nSome day on the public square randomly what happens during the brings but not today hopefully file I promise everybody's safe but let's get back to the conversation now uh twenty twenty just began we're talking about that here today but let's talk about churches in elections do have\nA way and I've got a confession to make it goes back to what we started to talk about it earlier today a in this program and and it's actually for me it's it's becoming a wound it's it's a bruise in it it's not good and it's a very a sore spot with me [noise]\nSorry about reading [noise] in my personal studies of of Jesus in the book of revelation chapters one through three and the reason that that's significant to me is because I read of the life of Christ every night\nAnd I've been doing that since I was in college when I had a professor who's focus was teaching the life of Christ who said it didn't count dare to say I dare you to read every day just for a few minutes every day for the rest of your life something from the life of Jesus from the gospels\nAnd I thought what a novel challenge so I respected this guy and I took him on\nNow I have now worn out several copies of the book that I use it as a sudden optic compilation of the life of Jesus\nAnd I said from your lips to God's Ears as soon as the provision is made and\nWe have the opportunity because whereas we take these shows from city to city we don't come into a city in St now you here's how much money you have to raise for the show to be here we don't do that\nWe trust the God's truth gracious contributions of folks who get the idea\nThat true reform for the individual for the family for the community begins with Christmas begins with the acknowledgement that we are not alone in the universe that God is and he has spoken and he has spoken in a person of his son Jesus Christ\nWas born in the manger we'd go looking for the manger every year well\nThis year we're going in Nineteen eighty one and because folks have been able to help us out with funding and support we go into a four shows to Nashville\nAt which by the way it would be better jumped because the first one is already sold out and two in Ohio and you're better jump on tickets because uh the at because those shows sold out last year\nRob how do they get tickets so I don't miss that part up\nThey can get them by visiting us at the public square dot com or calling us a one eight hundred five to to vote one eight hundred five two to eight six eight three\nIs it my understanding that we are going to be at the historic Franklin theater\nThis ... Franklin theater yes there are going to be a one house has already sold out sort the evening show right now so you'd better hurry if you want to be a part of that company\nWhat yes we're going to be at the start Franklin theater and windy years Nineteen eighty one okay and uh and if I remember it well yes you and I remember it well I'm Alan was actually in um a a swat link clothes and I\n[laughter] our our oldest was born in eighty one so I remember it well the earning him a Christian is that right yeah ... seventh Nineteen eighty one about a block at night I'll never forget it and the world will never be the same ah I was never the same\nThing my wedding and that's why well let me tell you a quick\nStory about Nineteen eighty one and how this fits it is so intriguing in his eye spitting out the national the other night we were doing a production meeting and and we're actually working on that song or a to Z Christmas Time if any Crosby piece it's coming back it's John Hart at least on a beautiful job of the high remember children's choir is involved in the song and all kinds of great things are going on [noise]\nNineteen eighty one er and I'll tell you right now we're going to cover this part of the history of the story enact too of Christmas in America Nineteen eighty one\nAnd if you look now if you go to the Franklin theater site or you go to the public square site what you'll find is a picture Nineteen eighty one Christmas in America of the White House with one window let\nAnd here's the story in Nineteen eighty one the movement for freedom and for liberty particularly religious liberty was a well down the road in Poland through the solidarity movement and in Nineteen eighty one\nThis revolution that was coming up through the old Soviet socialist republic and through through the USSR through the communist socialist network there was a a a a genuine first serious threat to their power\nAnd that threat was coming up on a poet well at Christmas Time the Soviet Union forced the polish government to strike back against solidarity\nThey jailed all the leaders of the reform movement I remember when that happened and it was it shocked the world and what ended up happening was the polish ambassador investors but I'll ski in protest defected to the United states huh\nAnd in his face he and his wife defected they were immediately ... try back in Poland and sentenced to death wow so they could never go back\nAnd ... visited with the president of the United states Ronald Reagan at the time\nAnd they had a private conversation and the ambassador asked the president on Christmas Eve would you light a candle in the window of the White House for the liberties of the people of Poland when members of the story yes it happened well\nThe president did just that\nAnd ... and then encouraged then he went out on his December twenty third a ... a speech to the nation one of the most interesting presidential speeches I've ever heard and I've studied a lot of presidential speeches\nAnd the president talks about Christmas and he talks about the ambassador and he talks about the people pulling in the ass all the people at the United states to light a candle now this is Nineteen eighty one\nThis is December of Nineteen eighty one\nBut the picture that you'll see for Christmas in America Nineteen eighty one with the one ... window that's the Reagan White house Christmas card for that year oh well you say well isn't that interesting that they all decided to coordinate all their themes there's just one problem with the narrative\nThe Christmas card was delivered months before the ambassador whatever sitting visit with oh my goodness and delivered to the White House before investors but I Would ever have that conversation with Ronald Reagan\nNow were you going to share this Christmas in America and I didn't just give it away\nWell that's just part of the story it get a clear these are the kinds of stories that come up when you go looking for the means you're in a year and it's such a amazing story how all of this has come to gather\nAnd so that whole concept of that late in the window is something we are going to be talking about and what it actually bore in the history of the world so things were happening in Nineteen eighty one that matter and we're going to find that we're going to celebrate them and the music around the show is oh my goodness\nIt's going to be so good and here's something I got to tell you to know about Christmas in America these shows are selling out before we announce a single musical guest because the point of Christmas in America isn't the stars who show up\nIt's the star Bethlehem ... and that's why people come people come for the experience with their family and you know it's interesting because a lot of Christmas shows are repeated\nNow they take them on the road they tore them they record them and then they'll bring them back every year is unique and different cars to pick a new year every year so if you don't see the Nineteen any one show you never will\nNever have second chance because it will be repeated so because we go for a year to year to year to year so it is such an exciting event Wayne I Can't wait I'm already writing the script for you brother I ... I'm\nLooking forward to I really am but for those who don't know about Christmas in America when did you go back and listen on line to some of the previous productions we've done so that you get a good idea of what what you're in store for\nThe thing that always amazes me about Christmas is America's the notes that we get from people around the country and they get in their car get on an airplane and joined us from miles and miles and miles away 'cause they say I I just I okay I hear it on the radio and that sounds great but I Want to be there and then the repeats they're there every year\nAnd this one of the thing I Want to add when is that a genuinely and honestly none of this happens because it's finance through ticket sales we offer the tickets to Christmas in America first suggestion contribution of twenty dollars for per person and ten dollars for students and we set up that way so that a family of five\nCan get there for under a hundred bucks because this is a gift and and and we want you to be there but it also means that people around the country\nGive it to the public square so we can do these kinds of events because that giving not only plus the audiences that are at these events but then Christmas in America rolls out to two hundred stations and now we have major commercial stations in big city markets playing hours and hours of Christmas in America shows during the holiday season back\nTo back yeah they give their hosts a break and so you can go home on Christmas Eve because we've got better programming and and so they played also this kind of a gift is going to reach thousands alright one more time Rob how did listeners get in touch with is the public\nSquare dot com or call us a one eight hundred five to two votes\nMaybe that was a tally in one one eight hundred and five to ... to a vote how do we do the Taliban moment was up for me ... all one in five uh to to do the\nOne eight hundred five to to vote I think that's culturally insensitive\nOr any of them know you guys were out of time come and knock it off it's time to wrap it up thanks for listening this week to the public square from the American policy [noise]\nPublic square the broadcast service at the American policy ... D voice your vote\nHenderson bail Nashville\nYou were talking about I mean I [noise]\nHello and welcome to another edition of memories in hell I'm your host for McCain I'm really glad you're with me

necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nRight they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ...\n... first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping\nReally because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics

real noticeable thing the right to their little trips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you know

if you're a diabetic there's all kinds of data about being decision and vitamin D and the list goes on and on it's a huge problem\nWhat does vitamin D actually do in the body what is it used for\nWell

system blood pressure following string plus ... has been linked to\nMaintaining hall and health brass cross an ovarian health but I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it's

guys they know their stuff and they're using that technology to convert vitamin D which is an oil into a dry powder\nAnd once they do that they put it in this vast dissolving Mel for immediate absorption and quick results that you can feel\nWhat some of the feedback that you're getting Dr panic is from people that are taking your\nFast smell the three\nOh I'm getting tons of feedback you

likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd Dr biggest why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency\nSuch an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D\nThe fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone\nThat should be there and it's not there and the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from the shot what\nMakes your fast smelled the three formula a much better

G. M. P. certified lab which means current good manufacturing practices\nAnd this is an FDA mandated set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently the FDA came in and did an infection\nAnd they said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your fast smelled the three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWell diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin in the body but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D three does is it takes that problem\nAnd it seems to fix it now they've studied vitamin D three and it didn't\nProve this insulin signature by sixty percent and just to give it a comparison the most popular diabetic drugs improve the Thirteen percent\nAnd only a few cold this toll free number it's one eight hundred\nFor seven six five six three zero\nPlus if you call right now you also qualified to receive an extra free supply with your order today to keep yourself or share with a family member or friend\nBut you must call

automatic monthly subscription programs this was a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor seven six five six three zero I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for seven six five six three zero\nSo how about if folks me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and deep to is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this\nAnd they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the rough where should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development\nAnd the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men the men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity cardiovascular problems start to turn it on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is\nVery very important ... people in their forties that's the way you know you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd or when you're in your fifties you start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not
