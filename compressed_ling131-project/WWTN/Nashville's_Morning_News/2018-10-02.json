Ford\nInitially did not want to come forward and have her name used\nBut she was sort of flushed out of the system and fleshed out by reporters and one wonders\nHow did the reporters get the information when it was a tightly held thing by Dianne Feinstein and her staff and apparently the staff of a congresswoman Anna Eshoo so I mean the ... the accusation is that they must have leaked it to someone so the reporter could then go knock on her door\nAnd make the didn't make this argument hey we're going to tell the story do you want to be a part of it\nAnd that ... wrong or to the forefront are you looking to try to find out how that process happened\nAbsolutely um and and I I think even members of the search your shirt committee or now requesting\nOr an investigation as to it it appears that the staffer leak\nOr the letter and the information concerning Dr Ford in an effort to force the issue and so you know that there was another outrageous abuse or process ... it's truly are awful for a ... point of view one\nDoctor for the privacy rights of she wants to be left alone and not be forced into the public eye you know that she has that right ah it look even if all these claims that she brought up you know they they sat or for weeks\nIt could have that address either you or I could ever private session of the committee where they could have had a very Frank back and forth it could have even interviewed her private there was no need for this while public spectacle but you\nKnow a politically motivated staffer it appears decided to force the issue what kind of a

is opportunity\nSo they were all these all down lay right they they they live in the last minute\nAnd then that stir the pot and I and everybody now is in a in a manner center turmoil trying to figure out what's true says not when they couldn't have brought it out as you say in a more timely fashion and is what would be the penalty or is there anything that could be done if it's found out that this was illegally leaked\nOut to members of the press by Feinstein staff\nWell sort of severe side of the of the spectrum if it if they were to discover that\nA server Feinstein was very way complicit in a you know some sort of gamesmanship to to blow this thing up the way that they did\nOn the far end of the spectrum there's exposure to say that I I don't think that's frankly going to be the remedy I don't think that either either Starbucks or the guts to do that [noise]\nUm I don't think that a response that as a you know has clean hands invest I think this was all sort of a strategy\nA but frankly that is the ... is the most severe version of it I like got Jill yes you're probably deserves it but um yeah they're they're going to do the uh oh mistakes were made passive voice or what a horrible thing we should never allow that to happen\nWhat will be that they might feel like I I agree that could be taken up by the Senate Ethics committee\nOh absolutely yeah in fact ... we've

has been sad\n\nThen but you you're you're the guy that has been set about and you've got to prove it you got to prove your innocence how can you do that well now Dianne Feinstein is getting a taste of our own medicine this all started when GOP Senator Tim cotton of Arkansas\nTold CBS his face the nation that Feinstein and her staff are going to faced an investigation for how they leave the information to the press this confidentially held information to the press\nAbout Dr Christine Blasey Ford and our allegations she didn't want to come forward with pay somebody leaked it how do I know that because they don't want an addict\nAnd they leaked it in the press started showing up outside her house and they do what people in the press to do what we're going to tell the story but we'd love

paying their places where they are bright shiny faces I'm so I'm reading the story I don't want to ask you guys have a question to the group have any have you ever undergone hypnosis\nI haven't how about you crash not that I'm aware [laughter] yeah that you might not be the answer\nIs they were the last thing that I Would say you'll have no recollection that's ... what about you Dan\n[laughter] [noise] I I have\nI've been hypnotized or as part of it and for a while I I think that a police officers were exploring this if you have somebody who can't remember a detail\nThat if you can give them in a relaxed hypnotic state sometimes memories will come up\nBut I think over time what police officers I've found is that sometimes those those that's like a dream anything can pop out you just gotta make something you have your your mind is in a very creative state and a very creative place\nAnd somehow sometimes the memories that are being brought up are are not accurate memories and then sometimes I Do know this about hypnosis when you're ... you're hypnotize when you hit mode ties you are in a very suggestive state\nSo if something gets planted in your brain you wake up believing that thing as you've seen sometimes these hypnotists you know a who I Am you know ... put on shows and what have you will make people caught like a chicken ... yeah yeah but I Wonder if you know what if they you get some little suggestion\nWhile you're undergoing hypnosis\nAnd that becomes the thing you believe with a thousand percent of yourself and and nobody can tell you any different\nAnd you know these are called contaminated memories sometimes happens within those ... and I'm I'm Wondering about this because there's a story out here that says the doctor Christine Blasey Ford had written a paper and when she talked about the importance or the application of hypnosis\nAnd retrieving memories ...\nIsn't that actually actually it was about is about depression can have noticed a used for depression but it sounded all of these articles right or would that that talk about retrieving memories so she has studied this issue at Lincoln I was really wondering why she didn't get asked that question\nI Wonder why she hasn't then used hypnosis to figure out how she got home that night right where were the address was or what year it was\nSuch a cynic well I I'm just saying come on the wind speed that day\nYeah well and you know and and it it I I have heard people say that through hypnosis you can recover amazing detail of things but I've also heard people say that you're subject to\nContamination she has studied the matter one wonders if in part of our memories and I'm just asking this question I don't know I'll be the first to tell you I'm not saying I Know there's to be the case\nI'm just saying I Wonder you've studied it have you ever been hypnotized as part of a you know the traumatic therapy that you went through is that where some of these memories might be different question I think it's a really fair question given that she has written about it\nRight as an academic yeah you know it does make sense\nSince because you think about like if your ear and having a conversation with someone and you you go oh what was that it was a a you know and you can't think of it what happens middle of the night you wake up and you go\nThere it is it goes from a relaxed in your mind yeah I Do that all that so that\nYou know I guess it kind of makes sense if that's a similar thing you're putting yourself in that relax state but at the same time like you also said you can just dream things up and you may think are true\nYou know being in that suggestive state of hypnosis as it's very similar to what to Dennis Dennis has to be very careful I read this or that one day I'd be very careful when they put you wonder was sleeping gas\nCars that sort of a a very you're sort of been a hypnotic state ... your mind is open to suggestion I remember the store and my mom tells it all the time\nHow she went to the dentist and they put her on the laughing gas and she was half out while they were working on her on her and somebody walked into the office and said man it is so
