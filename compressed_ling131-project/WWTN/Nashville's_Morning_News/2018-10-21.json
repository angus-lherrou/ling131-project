voice for the blood cancer patients I think that's a neat element of this is just a volunteer power behind you\nOh absolutely we couldn't do it without her volunteers from\nFrom board members to folks who volunteer for our events to raise money to especially the advocacy side you know getting the message out there to our our legislators that\nThis is something that's important to us a oral parity that's a big topic they're forty three states have already passed or parity\nOr limits the amount that companies can charge for specific oral therapies but people form that you take gotcha so we we speak up for our patients as well and and the the volunteers are there with his hand in hand\nBut when you're talking about kind of events and that side of things let's go in and switch it over when you talk about students of the year\nI'm a seven week challenge to raise funds for the fight against cancer and obviously benefiting the cumulative a society so let's talk about a treasure this is your chance to take them I say he was a little bit of a of a teaser on this philanthropic leadership development program\nSure on this is one in many ways that we had our last race science for all the wonderful things that were doing for patients and their families and it is a competition for high school students and it's like you said seven weeks long\nOn and it not only raises an important science for us on the line in a sense that really the thing I like to talk about is what it does for the students that participate\nOn it helps them develop skills on that they can\nOn things like a entrepreneurship marketing project management things that they can talk about in their college applications that can help them get into college is that not only that um things that they can carry along into their careers starting out so it's really um\nA lot of hardware to the students that participate but it really stays let them and get them so much more on top of just\nHaving a huge impact on what we can do an organization\nYes Saddam deeper in terms of um what the students go through a kind of what the expectation is and and give us some of the nuances\nSure so as far as the timeline and we had on we are in the process ever creating a high school students and say that freshmen through seniors I'm to participate and we and once they find them on and and talk to them about what Herman entails\nAnd we have um ... fundraising workshop for candidate for on their parents their team members and that sort of thing we get them all the tools that they need to learn how to find ways given strategies\nOn have than taught to parents and students have participated in the program before and getting them examples I think that they can to getting to be successful and then on the campaign actually kicks off\nOn January thirteenth we have a kickoff event at the end of Nashville and that's where we get everybody excited about fundraising and about um getting together with their team members and getting their support networks around them and then um the seven ...\nSeven weeks as often going on and then we concluded on march first at at the national city club and downtown Nashville and um that's where we celebrate all the hard work that they've been doing\nWe had a silent auction so they're literally fundraising up until the very last minute which is very accepting\nAnd nerve wracking for everyone um but then we announce the winner and\nI should say um you can run as a um individual candidates or you can run with two other candidates as co candidates um and then each candidate or for the candidates can have a team and we do encourage them each to have a team around them and those can be um parents\nAh friends family anybody any age group that can sign up to help support their efforts\nAnd then there's a scholarship this the the prize of this\nThat is right that's right so we and whoever ends up raising them as fun for the last at the end of the seven weeks is awarded a college scholarship on and then we try to recognize them in any\nWay possible for all of their hardware says that includes on recommendation letters to colleges and we've done school assemblies where we've done a ... presentation at their school to get them recognition there and\nWe've done publications where we recognize that in South blueprint for 'em to any number of ways um they\nAlso had the opportunity to write about this in their college essays and put this on their resume and it really just sets them apart from you know high schoolers and\nJust gives an opportunity to really shy on\nResumes and African shirt\nBecause you've got to a website where they can go to war and more into kind of get involved to talk about the west I\nSure so we have jets updated our new website is W. W. W. dot students as ear dot org\nAnd then once you get on there you can on search but that's in the tractor and it'll take you to all the local information about our events and on how to sign up and I'm also you know somebody that would um that you'd like to nominate we also take nominations and in addition to self applications\nTo Jeff what's stuff back to you and talk about obviously that's a big piece of 'em right now the focus but for you over all throughout the year give us an idea of some of the other way the odyssey financial contributions to fuel what you do the research and development I'm looking for the cures to the support programs all that you do on that side\nTo financial contributions that talk about as we mentioned you know there's plenty of ways whether it's through volunteerism activation advocacy give us some of the other ways that we can help you throughout the year\nAbsolutely I'm coming up November second we have our light tonight event downtown Nashville\nAnd it's an incredible night with with eliminated lanterns you Terry read one if you're a supporter or white when if you're a survivor or gold when you're walking your memory of someone it's truly inspirational night and teams come together friends and family team's corporate team sponsors\nOr we have a large stage we are far works it's a celebration of coming together making sure that everyone knows that we bring lied to the darkness battling cancer\nOutside of that we have men and women over here a\nGreat group of folks come together and it's the adult version of our students will be your friend ten weeks I mean usually about five weeks they're they're wanting to ring my marriage but my ten weeks they're saying this is the best thing that we've ever done because you do come together and when you see how much money you raise to battle cancer him and bring that light it's amazing\nWe have pennies for patients which over three hundred and fifty schools across the state of Tennessee participate in just bring coins in\nAnd it adds up in a hurry and that brings a ton of money over three hundred thousand dollars is generally through that program\nSo or team in training if you're motivated to run a marathon or half marathon or century bike ride our team in training cold tea in two years old always available\nAnd an outright donations and um that that kind of rounds of south from from us\nI think you know for listeners to or whether it's students are adults are more of the things that to me it's always been extremely popular but super easier and we just kind of stuff all the time especially with our family is you know you're you're go invite friends and family over to watch the titans game and just say hey we're going to provide normally food and drink anyway\nWhatever you would normally spend a lunch or dinner we're going to give that money and and and do it for a higher purpose of the cause and you'll be surprised I had a friend who did it over the NFL season a couple of years ago he was Fifteen thousand dollars but just how the people at our house watching it F. L. games and part of the beauty of it was that\nYou know people started getting more competitive so they started putting more money and but then what happened is about midway through the season people realize wait a second we love what he's doing we're going to do those are into it hosted at our house and because he had a good job of pulling them in from the non profit side to the passion they gave all the money back to him to give to the non profit and so I think\nI'm In a in a meaningful way but it's a very strategic ways it's fun\nAnd yet once again there's a higher purpose to being a you know he's talked about being able to eradicate a cancer that's that's important so huge and ah I I think that can be something that can be a rallying cry for for all the so as we wrap up until this there's one more time website social media world we need to go\nA little for seeing severe um as I said we're looking right now for candidate students candidate from high school so if you're interested in participating or if you know somebody that you might want to nominate you can go to the students of the year dot org and just click on the Tennessee chapter it'll take you to the national information\nAnd um if you have any questions I'm always available my contact information is on the website talking to anybody again about um students that might want to participate so\nNice that overall you got a little less dot org you also have left to the sea of Facebook as well as to the sea on Twitter I'm so you're you're you make it very easy for us to find you and you get involved all throughout so Jeff Trisha thank you for all you do it for another show I appreciate it thank you for\nSo what you really do much\nFedEx delivery passion what we deliver by delivering\nA better life with Dr Sanjay Gupta if you want to be rich\nOn Dr subject to the students do medical correspondent\nYou want to make a good guess as to how much money someone who makes the most important thing to know or their occupation their education their ZIP Code and their gender in that order after that according to a new study at a Temple University there is one personality traits they can\nYeah like like I said we're really trying to engage all members of our community culturally and an appeal to things that would interest everyone\nIf you're not just our usual audience by by members of the community who would rather see 'em a false band or you know just won a con men have their fees painting or you're part of the costume contest really really create a festival atmosphere for them\nTalk about um so it gets to once again that event Saturday or twenty seventh or eleven to nine PM free day so awesome opportunity where your family out talk about throughout the year some of the other favorites in terms of events programs ways that the public and getting it just\nOh man I had\nRough years twenty education and community engagement programs that any that we rent throughout this event on top of our regular um concert\nAre or classical program so yeah I really\nWant a good place to start is if you've never been to discriminate horn and um we have the chamber music series and those are free concerts um\nWith a smaller ensemble of musicians and it's a little bit more of an intimate setting you're in the larger Turner hall but the stages lowered a bit and the musicians organizing ensembles themselves and then pick the music that they're really interested in playing and that interest also\nI'm ... and like talk about it with the audience and answer questions and talk about why this piece is important to them and interest them and things like that and\nSo that's a really good introduction to meeting some of the musicians and being introduced to the hall itself than it is really good way to get like I said get to know musician so when you come later to\nMaybe a bigger concert you can recognize them on the stage so that one's good I'm beginning\nKind of first visit to the ... if if you don't go to ... when she really should [laughter] and we have um a lot of student concerts so during the school year and during school days will have concerts geared towards specific grades\nK through two three to four or five through ... in high school so we\nSchedule a lot of schools in Davidson county but an outline county says well to come visit for those\nThose are open to home school families as well and we haven't really on a huge home schooled family population here in the\nMetro Nashville area and we're we're fortunate to engage those patrons as well we put out a lesson plans to help prepare yeah those students for what they're going to see at the hall if they're not familiar with the symphony just kind of\nMake them a little more comfortable and ... and with what they're going to ... states before they come into the ... space\nYeah very smart talking about a year and engaging the sewers could they you know at a young age I'm ... I think symphony opera and there's so many things that kind of fall in this where\nThere's a really neat opportunity to engage youth is some creative ways and like we mentioned the onset there's there's so many benefits to 'em using music as a catalyst to work and not just learn music the learn life skills\nAnd so I think when you talk about doing things specific for those grade levels um there's a real strategic opportunity to use them as a learning environment but also a confidence builder\nUm a galvanize or\nShare with us on you know just maybe one or two other things that you're doing throughout the year specific to use programming the the the listening audience definitely needs to do about\n[noise] I think one of the kind of\nBest kept secrets is not something they were trying to keep secret but one of the biggest programs that is a little bit ... on the quieter side is our ... program\nAnd that is when the musicians themselves go out to schools and coach students on the instruments whether they're in band or a in youth orchestra or something like that so they will go out and\nPretty regularly visit students and work on work with them on what they're working on at that moment whether or not they're\nPreparing for a concert but for the end of the year or prepping for auditions for something I'm the musicians have really\nBeen pretty integrated into the schools and developing relationships with students that way and then we also have a ticketing program called soundtrack which is ten dollar tickets for students kindergarten through grad school so often students will get tickets that program\nAnd then see that musician that they've been working with one on one more in a group in their school so there's definitely just a lot of avenues where students end up being very familiar with the musicians and having a sense of ownership of\nScarborough horn itself and just a really strong relationship with the symphony\nTalk about season tickets shows some of those but I mean you you're on the radio so you're talking\nAbout some of this was the funding side of talk about some of those details yeah so\nLike Christian said we run around twenty education community ... programs but those aren't really possible without you know regular attendees and ticket buyers and subscribers\nAnd there are just a lot of avenues and in ways you can subscribe there's the classical serious which is always super interesting you can always hear some of the can and some of the classics that you expect to hear but often does our end up with the same concert\nUm side by side with something that's very new and very interesting it's something that you've never heard before so the classical series is very just a really joy to engage with and then we have popped series and a lot of special that happen with or without the orchestra it's just\nIt's really hard to lift satellites because it is a performance space so there's just a lot that's happening but definitely check out the classical series\nIt's a just a really great Suzanne and pops jazz I must be for getting some obviously movies we we've been doing the movies where\n... Potter and Star Wars of some of the big ones or you play the movie and the symphony is playing the sound different\nExperience if you think you've seen the movie of it all of a sudden you see that's like what what\nYou have an experienced a space fight or you know faced out Ira without like a ... a B plus musicians playing it for you it's amazing [laughter] make sure when you go you're dressed up to ... of course we love dressing up I was dressed as a primary last Saturday So [laughter]\nHe didn't mention that our family concerts which Kelly has done a lot of really amazing\nWork on um we had that you can buy a subscription to that chooses while there Saturday contracts they have\nWe have an instrument petting zoo and Vance of those as well and crafts and Kelly's on a lot of really great work to make those excessive all all of our family concerts or not what we call on censoring friendly and maybe Kelly can yeah [laughter]\nYeah so we started with century friendly with a a one Santa lung cancer and century friendly concerts are really meant to be accessible to individuals on the ... autism spectrum or other disabilities with sensory sensitivity is\nUm but ... what happened is that was so popular and so engaging that we've um thankfully expanded that to all of our family concerts so what that involved as we often have supports that help prepare individuals ahead of time so social stories that say this is what's gonna happen and what to expect\nWe also have quiet faces we have um American Sign language interpreting and closed captioning and noise canceling headphones if you need them and just all kinds of different supports and whatever you need or else extending a lot of those aspects to free day music so there'll be quiet spaces if you need to unwind\nNoise canceling headphones ... toys math and things like that so um we're really trying to expand the sex as accessibility part to all of our programming in some form or another it's really fun\nTo engage with uh the symphony on social media so we are not shy about responding with Jeff says we want yeah it's a lot of vinyl\nCruising kill I really appreciate all you do and appreciate your coming on the

talking hard numbers it's realistic to spin somewhere between five hundred thousand dollars to protect your home get some entry level automation are smart home devices\nAnd then on on a monthly basis you're investing somewhere around forty to forty five dollars a month\nCompletely independent of like having a phone line and that seems so old school to me but you know it's cellular service said jet ability to control it through your through your phone there's not other things that we need you to have so extremely affordable\nTalking about on your into just community engagement I think he being the founder obviously this is your company but\nUm you know in terms of your philosophy but just some of the things that you like to get involved with in the community 'cause obviously for what you do it is security it is interacting on a personal level it is um automation technology what are some of the things on your end in a in a broad scheme just your philosophy on just getting involved in the community and just\nBeing a part of it especially working with nonprofits and just given back\n[noise] yeah so we're a large supporter of a organization called center of hope and Columbia so they service Marin County as well as five other counties for it for any domestic violence needs so whether it's housing whether it's\nJob training counseling food clothing their resource for any of that I'm fortunate to have served on the board for the last several years\nAnd it's one of the organizations are we devote some resources to either we're always we're always involved in their events in addition to that we just really want to be a part of the community as as a locally owned and operated company\nI'm One of the unicorns born and raised in Nashville and so if there's an opportunity to support local sports teams\n... a local nonprofit it's we're we're always you know staying involved in that we were excited when sending her into the stuff the bus with William Sonoma County\nI'm In anything near and dear to her heart so one of our team members his brother actually was severely injured a as a member of our military and an organization that builds homes for a troops selected him to receive a new home last year so\nWe're very excited to hear that and of course you want to make a big uh be a part of it as well so we're able to take\nA a group from our company to go out and install the things that we install for homeowners every day or as as a contribution to this home being built for him and we can't wait for that to to come to fruition it's it's it's passed the pre wire stage show we would call so walls are up\nBut we're not quite to the end where we start to get to put the equipment and so anything that's really a beneficial to our team or we have a personal connection to that's that's where we like to be involved\nWell and just I think the stories that the personal stories it's extremely rewarding but also to it you know especially in this case where you get to like you said use what you do every day they use it to serve and help someone who sacrificed so greatly for our country that's a it just puts a smile on your face\nNow when we really enjoy getting an opportunity and being able to be involved with it\nYou as an entrepreneur I putting on that give us maybe one tip in terms of you know once again being the founder but you know for ... for advice who're entrepreneur is you know listening to the show they say hey I I I Want to start a business and especially if you're going from kind of the pest control business\nInto this line what advice would you give other entrepreneurs for taking that step that leap of faith just in general what would you tell them\nGo for it [laughter]\nYou know I think a lot of times people talk about finding your passion and turning that into a business and I think that's fantastic uh you know my passion is\nHelping people and building something and it's not necessarily exactly what the product is you can do that with a lot of different products and so you know my tip is to be a self aware as possible you know what your strengths are no which are weaknesses are surround yourself with people to supplement them\nAnd that served us while at prevention to uh to really grow over the last eight years\nAnd talk about a year and you know\nBeing able to integrate it with your own home and kind of test and use it for a family perspective what you glean from them being able to kind of see a lot of this and real world time and say okay these are the things that have been helpful for me to now pass along to others I think that's kind of a cool thing to as many cases you get to be your own consumer try the same\nAll all the time so it's a great example is that we've got to embrace modern technology and we're fortunate that our equipment manufacturing partner\nIs embracing him as well so there's an integration with Alexa and Alexa obviously is quickly becoming a part of everybody's home right so as soon as we started to learn about the possibilities the integration coming down the pipe\nYou know I got an election I didn't have long before put that in the home ironically my wife set it up and explained it to me on on what she had to go through but at the same in our house to be it speaks to the simplicity of it but you know we got we got a bunch of a lot of Alex's and gave those out to key members of the team and\nStarted a tad test and learned that uh and and then that's how we decided to go to market with it you know how big of a peace do we want this\nThat is what we're offering how much do we just want to really educate people on it and we're constantly figuring that out so it's exciting and yes my and my family has to be a guinea pig on a lot of it are often times I'm cautious if I'm bringing up the home camera I'll take a look at it first before a show customer [laughter]\nInside reading oil is you can say these are the things that and and even with ... election those types of things you you know how to use it how to apply it even maybe like what even to avoid so that way you become the true expert to help I think it's one thing to just\nYou know set it up and then move on that's why it's another to actually say now wait a second we've we've been using as our house for a year here the ways to use it effectively here's what word you probably want to avoid here's you know like I I Know they can be in the resource in other words really is powerful because in the end do you want to be helping people\nThat's exactly right and we do that I mean not just myself but all the team members you know make sure that they have it uh if if you're working prevention yet they're able to have the services so we offer a no cost because we want you to really

that's not okay it takes twelve years to create a graduate but it takes about the same time you created drop them\nAnd the difference between the child becoming one of the other could be meet\nMore could be you\nStudies show that if we get to these kids early or their chances are better and kid read well my third grade are more likely to graduate so joined me in the United way to to take them play it's become a volunteer reader tutor or mentors because when a child succeeds we all sixty [noise]\nAdvocate bothered to leave United in and take the played the United way that or\n... in vale

the border with Guatemala about two thousand Central American migrants have swam or restaurant across the river that separates the two countries and reform their caravan in Mexico they say they will resume their journey to the United states\nAnd if you'd like to compare how much money has gone to the meaningless material things places in pleasures that matter far less you know\nThe average American spends more money on Halloween candy than electing members to Congress and then we complain about our choices on every ballot there are bad candidates they're racist that can be skipped issues and concerns that still matter\nJust like in every church there's problems in every family there's problems the scriptures teach that God gave the institutions of family civil government and the church to humankind for a reason\nDifferent police show me a scripture that exempt you from any of these three spheres of responsibility and if you can't I Would be grateful\nI Would just like you much prefer a life or somebody else fixes our problems for us we ... so they use that to Rob and Rob did you send\nThat yet I Will be sending that I received it while I'm Dave and yeah so we passing that along wow because I Know people are struggling with those questions when they get confronted by friends that that asked that question I Would have asked because well like\nI mean if that's how you feel about political involvement what what television shows do you watch in your house 'cause obviously you don't have a TV [laughter] because they don't live up to any of\nThose four I'm convicted and I didn't even ask the question so day but I appreciate you taking the time to do that I'm\nI'm going to the sense a little bit because I think the question has an emotional tone to it [noise]\nI'm In and I don't know if this good friend is man or woman you know maybe it's a female and I I read it from a female's perspective being turned off by political parties to me that suggests that there is something that's frustrating you know which is an emotional part of the question\nIn my ... my answer emotionally would be pointing to cautious too late [noise]\nUm we we are going to have someone philosophy governing us and there's no way around that and a constitutional republic\nAnd cautions to eight says that seat to at that no one takes you captive to follow and deceptive philosophy so we have I mean that to me as you you can't just give up the most emotionally you can't check out\nYou have to stay engaged you have to determine that your vote makes a difference even if you don't feel like it does at the moment that you have to figure out who is on the ballot that's not going to set policies and and this is the most evident and people who govern in the state legislatures even in\nFederal ... students agencies but on education policy somebody is going to take you kept as we become captive by all of the different um\nControversial policy areas that you know have have just loyal to the surface in the last two years so I Would say cautious to eight would be inappropriate scripture to respond date\nI'm just going to quote from the ancient statesmen from the city state of Athens to Paris police who said just because you do not take an interest in politics does not mean to politics will not take an interest in you\nSo if you if you feed the battlefield if you if you evacuate the battlefield there's gotta be somebody coming in with a bad track\nRecord you'll take over and you're not going to like it very much okay I'm gonna step and I'm I hate to do it but we are going to have to take a break right now\nWe're talking on the public square about a letter that we received and Dave's response to that question why we should vote from a biblical perspective continue the conversation when we come back [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nMm Mm let's see there's our time and looting clothing budget gaps in all the insurance and the car payment\nWhere's the line in your budget that helps me to bail for Nixon was wrong in the air and a lot on today and it may be round table dot org enjoyment rowing team then giving every month to get America back on track and make your monthly contribution to Amy roundtable dot org\n[noise]\nReading the life of crime\n\nI'm mindful of something that a French chef or used to say if you are looking for the perfect or nothing you'll get nothing every time [noise] and\nUh I can remember having conversations with charcoal and about this for a subject you know charcoal son was a convicted felon and never recovered his right to vote in the state of Florida before he died and he lamented that greatly he\nLoved voting before he went to jail in the Watergate scandal and I think you'd be happy to tell you that he loved it even more when he couldn't do it if you missed it so much it was such a pain in his life in such a constant reminder [noise]\nUm so I remember talking to a trickle down about this as well and and I think we both reflected back on Dr Schaefer comments\nNow it's never fun how to vote when we don't like the choices and there are lots of options I Will tell you that I've been involved in pack activities where we've actually done a project called not on top campaigns where we actually didn't like the candidates at the top of the ticket\nAnd so we ran a protest movement to encourage people to not vote for the top of the ticket I that's that's a civic action that's sending a strong message but we showed up and voted voted the rest of the ticket because there's always issues whether it's a local tax\nOr local ballot renewal ... something that's important to be there it's important to show up\nAnd they're not all awful racist they're not all terrible choices so the idea of sitting at home skipping a race is a valid point and there are sometimes people have to\nOne of the things we do is analyze the numbers and one thing I always enjoy looking at after the fact is taking a look at\nWho voted for this race who didn't vote for that race how do those numbers compare if you have a couple of statewide races and this year we will it'll be interesting to look at key states and see\nHow many people voted for governor compared to how many people voted for the United States Senate and then compare with the parties and see how it all plays out because there's a lot of intricacies to go into that and you have to digest that after the fact so it's okay to skip some races\nAnd and Rob you have an interesting point that we want to make sure that you brought this to us earlier and on the idea of that whole one vote concept you got another new illustration that I think is really important in Pennsylvania\nIn Pennsylvania um there's a gentleman named John betterment and he is on the ballot in Pennsylvania you run for lieutenant governor in the primary separate from the governor so he ran separate he was elected in the primary to now be on the ballot\nOr in the governor's race of Pennsylvania but if you rewind the tape back to two thousand five or to John federal income from\nWell he is the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania she won the mayor's race embryonic Pennsylvania two thousand and five by one vote by one vote\nThat's how he wants Thirteen Years later after serving as mayor he is now on the ballot in in a poll say I know it doesn't matter to after election day but poll say he's going to be the lieutenant governor of the state of Pennsylvania so people say one vote doesn't matter where you can point to one example where it's ... held the career of one politician and\nYou have hundreds of examples over the last ten years yeah one voter a handful of votes for less than five percent of the votes have changed dramatically racist for everything all the way up to the U.S Congress\nYeah in one Midwestern state over fifty races in two thousand Eighteen alone was decided by one vote are tied over fifty races in one election cycle and he said I was in two thousand Eighteen was that primary yes okay yes\n[noise] so we know these things matter we know that there are important and we know that we don't always have the best choices a but the question becomes a every year they they they come at you and this is the most important election in our lifetime and and you say that you know what we're way past that you're at the public square\nEvery election is the most important election that's in front of us because it's so action that's in front of us for some of us it may be the last election we ever have the privilege to participate in you never know\nThat and the election that's in front of us is the most important one because we can't do a thing about the one that's coming tomorrow we can't do a thing about the one that happened in the past so it is an important election\nIt probably be a good idea those in Florida you definitely want to take a cheat sheet in with you you definitely want to have written down\nYour thoughts on the ballot issues so you don't get confused when you step into both\nMelanie what are your thoughts on for the ballot issues\nUm I think that with their ... percent majority there they do have more of a challenge and getting them passed and\nA lot of different ideas of the most of them I I I have concerns about these issues I'm In Florida it seems to be easier and easier to get them on the ballot this these are constitutional changes for the most part well\nA big part of that is because the the there's a constitutional commission that shows up every Twenty years and they have automatic access all they do is pass a measure through the commission and it's on the ballot most of these twelve didn't come from the people say that came either from the legislature that does it the easy way or this commission so the people for to guide gang up on\nThis time around and I I don't know that doesn't seem quite fair it doesn't seem\nFair especially when you look at what the ... war and being in this critical election year twenty Eighteen to people in Florida at their ballot could look like a book by the time they get their well\nAnd I got a question about this idea of restoring by constitutional amendment the right of convicted felons to vote in Florida a lot of states have a restrictions and we talked about this earlier is something that ... and I was concerned about but you know it's interesting he never suggested to me and our conversations that he would favor\nA a rescinding of that he\nFelt that what he had lost is the right to vote by committing a felony or something he would never forget would force them to love and service country in other ways but that by committing the crime he committed he it forfeited the right to participate in the electoral process and the grief him greatly\nI'm now there's a lot of people who say it's not just I mean I have to tell you I I remember talking to chuckle about this and he never said it wasn't just what what what what I did merits if you will even though I'm Out of jail I served my time\nI forfeited something when I broke the rules of our country at that level and I'm I'm I I forfeited that right in\nIn many people may not be aware that voting rights are done on a state by state basis when it comes to that of felons they change depending on which state you reside and voted and I think some people believe that it's a national law button each state has its\nOwn good point that's a real good point of the projections Melanie are that if that measure passes one point five million people in Florida will be added back to the voting rules that's a game changer\nWell let's just immediate right because think of all the felons in future years who will be able to get their voting rights back it's not just one point five million it's probably millions and millions over the next several years right\nAnd and and listen and understand that that there's a lot of attempt on some of these ballot issues to point them out as racial or somehow socioeconomic um Charleston was a rich white guy so let's let's be very specific you're a felony is a felony no matter what the color of your skin\nSo the law applies to everyone equally what makes me uncomfortable with our office in Florida and are so many friends and supporters and forwards it makes me nervous that there's a one point five million felons\nConvicted felons um in in the state of Florida I'm Sorry I'm a you know look I'm all for reformation offers second chances and all for the grace of God to give someone the full benefits of every possible second chance third chance\nBut I don't know it makes me uncomfortable ... I didn't know there were that many convicted felons in Florida\nYeah the staggering number when you try and put it in perspective in again\nIs this something Dave that we see coming from national organizations that are pressuring these individual states to do this I Know there's a work across the country because they know that along the lines of ballot issues that can help influence people's decisions of people running an actual candidate races as\nWell well another example of that would be Florida has a casino gambling measure on uh that that's a very important I Believe that's valid issues rain Florida that will have ramifications across the country as well and so the idea of outside organizations coming in reminds me of a couple of articles we've been sending around about Ohio ballot issues\nNow here's once again where the entire nation needs to pay close attention because you may have not known\nThat George Soros or who is without a doubt the major funder of progressive initiatives around the country at least the major identified a a funder of progressive issues around the country and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook have engaged in a multi million dollar investment in the campaign in the state of Ohio\nOn a question of sentencing reform and changing drug laws and the state and this issue has become a real hot issue and it's become highly polarized and there's an intense desire to try to pitch this issue which is an attempt at a constitutional amendment that's very sophisticated to leave it six pages long\nTo get it passed and people are now sort of spring boarding off of different platforms saying if you're for racial justice if you're for equality\nIf you're for a socioeconomic justice if you're for prison reform of your for um a equal treatment of all people you must be for issue one so the issue is accelerating to take on a life\nThat is much bigger it's now entered into the sort of realm of the political caricatures and and\nNow here it is and it's gets crusading right down the center square of a swing state in the middle of the country and promising to come to a state near you so ah anybody want to get in on this with your thoughts about ... and Soros launching I'm In Ohio is a laboratory to change the country\nWhile what they've done and you hear a say off and on the public square words matter\nAnd words in law matter especially when it pertains to the constitution of the state\nAnd this language in Ohio would go into the state constitution and what they've done to try and divide people to make it more polarizing as they've gone to each group of people they want to target I feel\nAnd just pulled out a section of the amendment and said focus on this this is what this amendment will do that don't go to the next group of people and say\nFocus on this this is what this amendment will do for you and your community then they go to another group and they said this is what it will do for you meanwhile they're ignoring the other parts of the amendment were the words are so terrible\nAnd will destroy many families in many Ohioans but their commercials don't seem to say that and they don't seem to be operating\nUp front and honest with everyone they're communicating\nWith and I've been as a as a pastor I've been educating my congregation for the past several weeks on issue one and a directing them to the website to ... voters which shows the actual wording of the amendment is is there and black and white\nSaint ... you know watch read this carefully so you know people who were convicted of ah of ah doing drugs or selling drugs whatever\nTheir fences will be reduced to that of a misdemeanor okay and did it says this will not affect those convicted of murder rape\nOr child molestation it does not say however uh anything about other violent crime so I'm saying so so actually if you are convicted of\nAttempted rape attempted murder assault and battery kidnapping surgery you can get your if introduced by twenty five percent for you I hate to stop us right here but we do have to take a break I Will pick this conversation right back up on the other side of the break and so she could soon right here to help us with [noise]\n\nThe fight back for more like ... [noise]\n\nYesterday I think it's important that we understand in the midst of this election cycle with everyone telling us how desperately important this is his\nMy life and I commented the other night ... says this is I think she saw right she said thank God we can turn off he believes in God we can get away from the television\nCommercials from all of these negative ads and watch baseball where people of every color and every size can be batting champions and ... and and home run kings and\nAnd pitch a hundred mile fast balls and people of every size shape and dimension or in the stands cheering for their team and the politics of it doesn't matter doesn't it feel good to have some thing that we can be for\nThat's positive\nAnd we don't have to hate each other for and I thought you know what that's really well said thank God for baseball and in a sad way it used to be that we felt the same way about America that we felt about baseball that's why we talk about baseball hotdogs apple pies and Chevrolet not unintended advertisement\nBut the idea that there were some things that brought us together they were bringing the things that brought us apart and our civil government used to be one of those things that we did was such pride and it was always bigger than ourselves I think it's a fair question to ask how did we get so far divided\nI just think it's terrible to mislead people with a generalization now how can anyone be against us every policy question has two sides to it\nEvery policy question should be debated in the legislature so witnesses can come forth to bear truth as to the impact of that policy on their life or their community or their family so to generally from a from a Christian\nCentered microphone tell abroad listening audience how can anyone in the Christian Community me against this issue is extremely irresponsible\nAnd I just I'm frustrated with that because very few people and I'm hoping as a growing number of people who will\nBut few people take the time to actually read the tax they will simply go off of soundbites we have to change those habits in our lives\nThere is a bigger picture here and the fact is that you can look at the political article that we've got posted on our website and understand that these ballot issues in contacts all across the number of issues represent a part of the progressive agenda for where they would like to drive thinking and policy in America and this is just one of those places\nAnd the question becomes when conservatives attempt to use the constitution or to make ribs visions for agenda items they are some merrily criticized for playing with the constitution for personal agendas\nBut progressive announce it loud and clear and an endless their issues in Politico as we've listed that article at our website at a a pie roundtable dot org\nOr you can find it and and yet they seem to think that it's it's wonderful and fine\nAnd I mean Alan I think that when we talk about the progressive agenda I there are issues philosophically that we have to recognize this is bigger than political parties is this about a movement that's been out there in this country for a long time in fact it goes back to the whole way to wear a Brits like J.K chest hurts and talked about progressive ism and the definitions of it\nDavid that's true one of our favorite authors here wrote about progressive is monitored years ago\nIn his book a what I saw in America said progress is Providence without God that is it is a theory that everything has always perpetually gone right by accident it is a sort of atheistic optimism based on an everlasting coincidence far\nMore miraculous than a miracle so educate Chesser instead about progress every visited America\nDoes that single quote alone is probably the best philosophical summation of the movement of progressive isn't that began in the Nineteen hundreds\nA witch when and and actually was probably had its greatest advocate in Woodrow Wilson at president of the United states in the early Nineteen hundreds and a college professor who was one of the defining pillars of progressive ism\nAdjustments in got it exactly right that caught so good Allen did you read that again\nCertainly he says progress is Providence without God that is it is a theory that everything has always perpetually gone right by accident it is a sort of atheistic optimism based on an everlasting coincidence far more miraculous than a miracle\nSo we know that it's a God Bless equation progressive as ms because it starts with Darwin a bout Boudreau us and was very clear about making that statement and even advocating that the problem with America was that our founding was placed on the wrong platform\nThat the platform of the creator was the wrong platform that we needed to move to a ... a a platform of Darwinism and that's where progressive isn't begins Allen chesterton said more though about progress as he\nDid he actually thought the word progress was was a useless worry says progresses a useless word for progress takes for granted an already defined direction and it is exactly about the direction that we disagree\nI think it's important to understand that we have divided the world between Democrats and Republicans in the American voting mindset this is not the way politics works politics works in the realm of ideas and this brings us all the way back to our first listener letter as to why should I be involved\nBecause most of what we see in politics is dealing with symptoms not with root causes the root causes or the ideas to world views the fate statements of these different movements\nAnd right now it's crystal clear that the progressive movement in the United states is using every political party every ballot issue every window of opportunity every candidate campaign that they can get their claws into to basically drive their agenda to create a whole different form of America\nSo this is a much bigger battle than people understand and that's why every single prayer and every single vote is so important\nSo these ballot issues that we're talking about across the states are in many instances are progressive agenda items of this clearly they outlined it clearly in this article from political we're talking about\nLaying out the ones whether it's climate change or whether it's infrastructure tax credits in fact I'm there so clear about it that they actually are advocating the fact that you've got to have the biggest boldest possible ballot is used to drive public sentiment toward the progressive agenda\nSo that's what we're in the midst of a ... I Know that most of what you're\nBring about this election has to do with the house in the Senate has to do with who's in control the Democrats are the Republicans are premise here is it's bigger than that from a perspective a biblical thought and it's much bigger than that from a perspective of political thought these ideas are bigger than the parties\nThey are bigger than the party's Dave and that's why it's important that people in this will be a plow guy voters dot com visit I voters dot com to understand\nWho and what you were voting on you don't want to show up at the voting booth at the last minute and say I'm I'm here just to do my part understand what you're part is do your homework through your research sure I voters dot com with your friends and family make sure everyone has the information they need\nJeff swimming talk to you about pastors for a second to know that I talk with John bouquet uh who's on our board of trustees pasture bouquet as well\nYou get in one of these ballot issue fights in and you're being besieged by people who are claiming to be advocates a social justice racial reconciliation so many other issues that are valid issues that need to be discussed and suddenly they're trying to push them into a ballot issue I think that's intimidating because\nA pastor's for the most part aren't lawyers or be there not lawmakers and see how the how do they how do they begin to respond it's it's intimidating\nOf well of course it is but as a pastor is your responsibility to my responsibility as a preacher of the word of God to protect the flock\nTo protect the flock to the number of ways I I a guard the flock doctrine ally but also if there are people are out there trying to physically harmed the flock I have a responsibility to address that and so I go to resources to explain to me ... or I go to the actual wording of the amendment itself\nI think it's something very important step for every church every\nFive oh one C. three organization on their websites to list voters dot com as a as a resource it's nonpartisan food is produced by a nonprofit it can be used it I'm bound issues that's going to give both sides of the issue with objective information and you can weed out all of the crazy marketing\nDon't tell you a quick story from it from a pastor's perspective of some people in my church needed a ride to a for their car the car was broken down and said can you take us to the shop and I said sure come on get in the car so I was taking them to the place and they said hey tell me about this issue one\nAnd tell me about this and that and so forth and a lot of political questions I said what you need to do is go to either voters\nWith an S. I. voters dot com and they did and they thanked me on Sunday they said hey that really cleared up a lot of things for me\nJeff that's a great story I think it goes back to the whole beginning of this letter why bother as a Christian devote well\nBecause your country's at stake in the direction of your country the ideas it's so much bigger than one single candidate one question of one issue it is the entire direction of where we are going and we're call to be solved in light\nThe good news is I voters is one of the tools that can help the public squares another the American mission series is the third and as a disclaimer\nWe don't claim for a second to have the final word or any of this\nBelieve the final words actually found in the scriptures and in our founding documents that's where the final word is that's where we come to the realm of deciding questions like self evident truth do we still believe it is there or we aren't just a progressive realm in the midst of nowhere\nThese elections count on big issues and small issues alike\nWe love listener responses and we thank the folks who wrote to us to help inspire today's program\nWe're not interested in being right or wrong which isn't being formed to the truth because we recognize the\nAll of this is bigger than us and we all need help [noise] that's why we do things like a motorcycle and this program for\n\nThe public squares of broadcast service at the American policy round table\nI'm In the car next to you on the highway heading to work\nHave your mail Nashville\nStudio where I mean I [noise] [noise]\nHello and welcome to another edition of memories in hell on your host prison McCain I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that have been each and every one of us and that stress\nDisorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's that's due process and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for\nPeople that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes you ride any do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the ... formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and that case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nA vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spending nickel magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate\nAnd I want you to check them out when you have a chance because they really have some great products to improve your health and the healthier family\nOkay on

population ranging from\nPain loss of balance muscle weakness depression increase blood pressure arthritis memory loss and even a compromised immune system and I have Dr Michael Pincus with me today to talk about the most effective way to get money to Monday Dr Baker's it's good to talk to you again\nIt's great to be back thank you\nYou know many of you know that Dr ... is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's a successful chiropractor he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional ... athletes and it continues to be very involved in some today's top health concerns and\nLet's kind of start at the top doctor Pincus and talk a little bit about what are some of the warning signs that you may be deficient in vitamin D\nOkay well part of it is how you

huge problem\nWhat does vitamin D actually do in the body what is it used for\nWell when we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay and that regulates thousands of genes in the body everything from pain blood sugar immune system blood pressure falling string\nPlus ... has been linked to maintaining whole and healthy\nBreast across an ovarian health\nBut I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it all messed up\nWell why do you say that why is it messed up\nWell first of all do you go to your doctor and they
