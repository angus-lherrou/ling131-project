where dogs I mean I [noise]\nToward vacant sales tromp on the attack are becoming fat\nFollowing intense debate Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed and then sworn in as the one hundred and fourteen justice of the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm not every start up or entrepreneur is really meant to take venture capital or doesn't make sense for them so what are some other means they can use to grow their business\nUm market access and so again connecting with corporations and there is an education component both on the side of corporate to working with the start up and launching a pilot on but also with start ups on how to develop a pilot with our customer um\nAnd then also helping them with their market strategy on another bucket like I mentioned his talent and so that's our town recruitment and on ways that we can help our started up so that that um and and also developing talent and a lot of that gap that we're recognizing the talent are related to technology expertise\nOn another bucket is marshals Asian and so I'm kind of going back to what our legacy organization was focused on working with the research Institute's like a vendor belt or Oak Ridge National Laboratory\nOn earth than Jews in Memphis to take some of the technology that they've developed in commercialized that um and bring it to market uh\nAnd then also uh environment and so\nThat's kind of one of our big buckets and ...\n... says um our our state wide network of partners and making sure there's the infrastructure and not door that an entrepreneur can go to for resources but also making sure that Tennessee remains a business friendly state and so on we do advocate for some policy on that could positively impact are entrepreneurs and investors\nYou know so it's not just the environmental environment is the business environment exactly exactly exactly so it was to talk about what success looks like how how do you measure success especially when you look at it across the state or local ... water some of the success metrics that you're looking at [noise] show\nOn ... in the past a lot of the success metrics or how many entrepreneurs we're touching and kind of converting through that pipeline so they walk through the door they have an idea and how do we convert them to the next program and to the actual inception other business\nI'm so over the past six years they've touched about ten thousand entrepreneurs um another component of success would be raising capital a and attracting the outside investors and\nTo you know helped develop the companies and on and on the company's um and then and now they're a big factory focus on our jobs created um so we're at about two thousand jobs created last six years and we went to see that really triple of the next five\nNice you know obviously with each one of those jobs there's an economic impact\nOr when you talk about job creation discretionary income we all those things ... house and all of those there's a nice ripple effects of the community\nShare maybe one or two success stories when it when it comes to when you can name the to the company if you want but just give us a give us a couple of fun little teachers on hey this is what to do with ... latest and greatest thing going on but ultimately that we've kind of out of hand I'm sure\nI'm so when it comes to mind that space here and middle Tennessee actually in a rural community and I'm has just been a really incredible job of capitalizing on all the resources I not only watch and if he provides but the state as stony create colors\nUm and said they are disrupting the supply chain of I'm developing and to go to that dire blue jeans\nUm and so Sarah\nComes from Cornell University and she recognized that a lot of the indigo was being developed outside of the United states and the supply chain was not on here and the United states and the other concern was is it was polluting a lot of our rivers and streams and so\nUm she is working here in middle Tennessee with a lot of farmers to 'em\nGrow and to go and redevelop holiday processed that supply chain and bring it to market um she's seen a lot of success you got a factory on mountain Roberts and county and she's also working with partners like Patagonia and Jay Crew to on\nClean out their supply chain line to use these dies so that's cool that's always an exciting one um\n[noise] we think about another one and another one in middle Tennessee that comes to mind um I before I step into the role of partnerships I worked part of our students founders and so she um her and her team were winner of our student edition pitch competition last year and it's called path acts\nAnd he'd been about student ... student and she is developing technology and commercializing one that helps to treat sepsis and said there hasn't been a whole lot of innovation within that market um I think it's in the last fifty years\nI'm says she's got a really incredible new product or tool um to help treat that\nAnd all that's going on right your own backyard that's true so are you rent 'em walk us through how we use the public can help me obviously I think it's important to know just you know what you're doing it through here and like you said some of the success stories that are happening as a result of your efforts but what are some ways with the public can help\nShore and so what launched and is he in our partners do um there are so many opportunities for people to get involved\nOf course if you have an idea please come to us and so we can find a way to help you or help these help you navigate the right resource on if you have a certain expertise and you want to become a mentor\nThat is always a huge demand for entrepreneurs if you are interested in ... but you aren't really sure where to get started that's something we'd also like to help with on if you work for a large corporation and you all have innovation strategy is that um you might need help with or\nYou're looking for some disruptive technologies and maybe house in purchasing power and you'd like to think about using one of the start up here in Tennessee\nI'm early in the south east we love to talk with you I'm so there's lots of ways for people to get involved from you know starting a company to invest in a company to to buying from a start up company here in Tennessee\nI'm to working for a start up and and we can kind of help match you with all those opportunities\nGive us a something that was a smile on her face when you talk about being able to work with the arch Moore to see the the fruits of their labor so to speak but also to know that\nYou know many cases you're helping 'em an individual family fulfill their dream we take that step which is is really cool book with a smile on your face during the work that you're doing to be able to do this\nUm there's lots of things that put a smile on my face but if I'm thinking about working with an individual entrepreneur\nUm you know a lot of them especially in the health care industry are and some of these legacy industries in Tennessee who are working to develop their business on it takes a long time to sell and to the corporation and to navigate that system I'm so when we get a caller attacks or an email saying\nI just crushed that meeting or you know we just got the contract signed an executed on especially after you see them kind of struggling to get to that process that always really puts a smile on my face\nUm and and just getting the messages from the nearest we work with are understanding that project that we worked on um I've also runner internship program um that they had a really good experience with her and turned and they hire them full time that really puts us on my face as well\nI'm curious you know an hour and we ... ourselves and work with them and even myself I Know many of them and try to mentor them and work with them and it's always exciting\nTalked about expectations I think this is something that's really interesting and I'm even thinking of a conversation I recently were you in their mind the expectation was they they want to ramp up quickly and you and in two or three years they want to be like you know doing all this great great stuff and\nIt's like okay but but really I think it's like more like three to five years and it's it takes so much of it really is framing the expectation\nOf what's realistic and and not to be a W doubt or in any way but it's like\nI think you know with anything in life we what the silver bullet this this quick fix did even to your point about just the hard work for you guys have done um it it it's in many cases it doesn't happen overnight now once you start working for many years and all of a sudden it's like you look how far we've come in and that amount of time it's it's amazing to see\nBut I think framing expectations is so important for entrepreneur infer mentors and anybody who stepping into that space\nAbsolutely and we have had a lot of tough conversations with our entrepreneur is to help manage those expectations and a lot of what we do is\nTrying to guide them to kind of rethink um you know some of the goals they've set and think about a different means of approach um or give them some homework so I\nSaid he expectations is not only a challenge for entrepreneurs um but for investors for some of our funders for all the makers I I'm\nNot everyone is going to be that they spoke it doesn't happen you know overnight there's a lot of work that goes into it especially for again a lot of the industry is that we have here in Tennessee the longer process so\nI'm a mean setting expectations has been a challenge and I think it will continue to be won by we find that after we get to this to have conversations and there's usually a really\nPositive result you know to that point once the expectations realistic you do okay this is kind of where we're going to create a realistic roadmap as well as I think all the way a rounded everyone with\nAbsolutely and it I think it also make some of the the milestones that entrepreneurs are trying to meet 'em a little bit more within reach obviously um but it also helps er during\nAbsolutely so go ahead and tell listeners where they can learn more noted for their social media website how do we\nWell the best way to stay engaged launching a cease to visit our website and sign up for our weekly newsletter um\nIt's full of lots of really good information whether it's related to the Tennessee started up scene and and programs and resources available but also really cool new stories about some of the marriage they work with um certainly got our website you can also follow us on Twitter 'em and visit us on Facebook and it is all launched\nYeah and the website launched T. N. dot org ... Brittany ... really appreciate coming on the show and thanks for all you do it for\nThat's kind of where you know it it it's become difficult and for us we're looking down the road into two thousand Nineteen we're seeing you know some headwinds let me just to be quite quite a quite honest with you um it's not going to be a situation where you can run out and and just pick the house that you want any longer you're really probably going to get into a situation if\nIf it's a a nice area or an area that's desirable for a lot of people you might find yourself in a bidding situation instantaneously because there's just so few houses out there right now I'm from a first time homebuyer standpoint I Will correct\nSome folks in myself off into say two there's plenty of housing but when you get right down to the ball them that that particular sector is missing a the inventory and that's been a real struggle\nInteresting okay so let's talk about kind of one more layer and the sense of um incentives I Know that there's been says on the construction side there's this this is talk about incentives from your vantage point um and what that looks like and then we'll dive a lot more into the nonprofit side of what you do as well\nSo you know there's always um you typically nowadays if you finding that you like a a new construction home that\nA lot of your builders will offer downpayment assistance they'll pay some of your closing costs at first community we have what we call a commitment to close for anything that are on new construction where we'll we'll we'll give a thousand dollars to the transaction as well so\nA lot of a lot of cases you'll you'll find borrowers will go in and sit down with a builder they'll get some closing costs paid on that end will pay some closing costs are in and there's um it's when when they walk away without having to spend a lot of money or pull a lot of money out of their pocket um there's all kinds of down payment appropriate assistance programs we can talk about from\nTh the aid rural housing to you know there's just a a plethora of choices and as a company\nUm we have recently just gotten into um the first choice loan program and that's\nOur our bank has for the first time decided that they were going to put up a million dollars ten thousand dollars per transaction for a borrower who need a down payment assistance and you can stack that money on top of some of those programs\nIf you don't need all the money then you can turn around and use that money to buy that principle down and that's another very important piece because you know you come in and you you have a loan amount that you're prepared to pay a payment based on and with that additional money left over you can put it toward the reduction of loan amount which you know that's that's a big deal for first time homebuyers\nAnd we go through your financial situation from your job how long have you been on the job um do you have a spouse that's going to also contribute to the transactions well in in this day and time was automation being what it is you can find out a lot of the things that you need prior to coming to that meeting just by getting on the phone and talking to an advisor in that person to tell you hey you know\nI really only this this year one of your tax return I mean I I might just need your most recent pay stubs\nUm depending upon on new construction loan\nVersus alone that you're buying that's pre owned a new construction probably going to be a little bit more documentation because it's going to take long you know to me personally I think a lot of people would agree that\nIn the in the day of technology and all the automation that second place there's still so many questions that you're going to have and you really do need to ... so let's switch gears and talk about philanthropies talk about first community mortgage cares\nSe um cares is a it's awesome it's are nonprofit and it was started by our CEO Keith Cantor\nAnd the first year we raised over a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and basically there's four different categories of focus and it's women and children housing education and veterans\nAnd it's a it's an employee ran um\nNonprofit and basically it's it's something that we have elected to do we feel like we have much better control over where those funds go we had so many\nSo many employees that wanted to give to so many different things and a lotta times we would ah donate back to the communities that we serve in and you know you you just never know how much of what you're donating is going to the cause to the actual cost and so this was\nSomething that we did to kind of mitigate that to change that a little bit and give us the chance to have a say it where where those funds were going and so I'm very proud of that um it's it's you know it's something that we've\nWe've wanted to do for years and uh we started last year in March and or in a nine month period raised a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars so it was it was a big deal more over two hundred thousand dollars I Believe this year to this point\nNice yeah and and share with us in terms of what that means for the community but obviously obviously for for your team um the engagement I think now knowing that there's a higher purpose is so important within everybody's work I mean you want to feel like\nYou're you're working for a company that's making a difference and you want to feel like you as an employee or making a difference and I think when it comes to being involved in the community and opening up this opportunity to financially but also to physically be involved it's a it's a great opportunity for your team\nIt's wonderful and and the fact that we're logo is a big deal I'm we're given back to the community\nWere watching um our our funds be put to work in a very positive way\nUm we we also abide by kind of a ... at our at our company that's called ... four and a you know we we search for the customer for ... for the community we sort of for the investor\nUh we we are all things or community mortgage and we donate a lot of that money back into the community to make sure that everything that ah that\nYou know we hope to see for our our our partners um are far worse our customers are investors everybody gets a a part of it so it's it's um it's a very special thing we take it very seriously\nTalk about a ... a golf tournament there's a ...\nOr the other Tyler Tyler Moore see a it's a team of we call the chemo golf tournament we've been doing it for five years\nIt's a it's actually this gentleman was a Twenty one years old he was killed tragically in a car accident and uh he was such a positive kid he had so much so many positive things or effects on people that um we decided to take that opportunity to do a golf tournament for four years we've done the golf tournament\nAnd over that four year period we've had over twenty local charities that we'd donated to over twelve hundred a kids have been directly affected in rather for county\nUm we've raised nearly two hundred thousand dollars just from that golf tournament and Christmas with the kids the big deal to us so um this this thing has turned into a two day event was Seventy Seventy or\nSeventy teams and we've got you know places that you can sign up and donate but it's a it's a fun fun event a lot of people get out and have a great time with it and uh we look forward every year because every year it gets a little bit bigger every year we do a little bit more we gain a little bit more money so I'm all those things are really and truly the fabric\nYou have seen I mean that's what we're about I think it's his knee 'cause many times you\nCompanies are doing good but you don't necessarily see them ten o'clock news you don't necessarily see it out there and you're kind of working behind the scenes to\nHost things to give money to nonprofits uh financially get involved obviously but but physically get involved and to to make these your community calling cards and I think there's just a lot of good going on and it's just need to hear it's like yeah we we're we're we're trying to make a difference we're doing everything we can or given are all because it's it's ... reasons\nFor the right reasons and you got to give back I mean you know one hand to help somebody else out I mean make sure that you know they've done things that are necessary to keep\nOur you know our integrity upheld and and the things that we like to do or feel good thing but stuff that you can look back and say I'm proud to have been a part of that in the same time there are so many people that do need assistance and and and we've got to be aware of that and that's that's why it's so so so great to be a part of this organization they're\nSo good Brennan and kind of wrap up with the website social media where do we go to learn more\nYou will go to first community mortgage dot com\nForward slash T.

I was impressed because I saw the opportunity I saw that they win win situation but\nMost of the sea some loan officers that were reading the market they wouldn't helping me to achieve what I was born into a chip to what we deed journal means we hired\nA education majors we hired a finance major that were from Hispanic families were from African American families we start training them into loan officer so we we basically\nHigher college junk professionals college graduates and started building their skills into their mortgage process we started doing that to yourself well now we have a group of for a loan officers are bilingual\nThat are very confident about originated in alone and they're becoming one of the top producers in within our company because they said they have this relationship with the commute already built time\nHow do you manage a 'cause I think this is kind of the HR side of it is how do you manage their expectations and their diversity to get the best out of the group as a whole\nThat's the way we we handled this as we go for the core of ... when you when you bring them or the first thing that we\nDo is winter there's into our CEO will explain that we start foregone so that was here because we started that community we serve our employees was are they of course the stakeholders and we say our our clients we we're serving over a Serbian oriented institution\nThey aligned to those values for them will be very easy coming from a diverse community coming from other birds by ground they said they see the advantage for for them professionally but also to serve their their their own communities uh we have found that a spirit or as as the the main\nResource for us to develop them that that at that hunger for Serbian\nThat hunger for world and it goes beyond that money goes beyond the section for us it's more about uh having another family getting a new home looking at the ... the the example of a U.S how good example Jeremy we have this gentleman living in a hotel for two years\nTo Spain ran weekly and she didn't know he can afford it as a U.S citizen from one of my law\nBut he didn't know he could afford a home well nobody has taken the time to explain the process he came to us into buying a home with Europe or send them payment\nHe brought his family from what am I allowed to leave with him and and we have an amazing started that was or start up an industry everybody got inspired so we have this inspirational a community oriented philosophy and then you start digging up into the skills to create and having the latest technology\nMaking them um scanned helping him just condor documents on their cell phones instead of coming on the way from Nashville to more for more than just having appointment\nSure so a brand new kind of alluded to it but the nonprofit side first meeting mortgage cares sheriff from your vantage point what the nonprofit does and the community and and how that's impactful for especially diverse audience\nDefinitely definitely for ... for community care sets him cares\nIs is that employee driven organization and and as as random probably share with you we almost uh we went above a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars in in contributions we're our own employees and when you started giving back to the community to community knows that you are you're for real\nThat you really want to invest in them in in in in their wellbeing\nSo we had a return is people to ask a lot of questions like oh well uh especially women that you eventually have the run on a ... house and then out of that what we're trying to ...\nThey miss a view view getting to a saw these credit and building a initiative started building I saw these employment and work relationships there's so many things that will help you become even better that you are right now and they're only because we are giving you something but you can getting ready to buy your own\nOr created pry the homeowners shooting them or we also have the better on top of the cage and educational opportunities for junk Hispanics are key for that but I think for our country then one of the ... that\nAre Hispanic base we have I think they're better country will be because they are they're growing there they they they are the end you know they grow the homeownership we want them having better jobs more prepared because they will

five point nine earthquake has shaken northwestern Haiti damaging homes at church and at least one hospital there are injuries and damage and local media reporter at least ten people who've been killed\nAnd as I was watching this entire process I could not get his voice out of my head [laughter] and so I took the time to uh to go back to that passage in the Old Testament in the book of exodus that commandment though those part of the words of God written on the stone\nThou shalt not bear false witness against the neighbor and I thought we'd start a with a burst for Matthew Eighteen in fact Matthew Eighteen sixteen I could somebody pull that one up and read it to us\nMatthew Eighteen sixteen but if they will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses\nAre the words of Jesus in that Matthew Eighteen passage about conflict resolution and\nMight surprise people to discover that would Jesus is actually doing in that passage talking about the process of how you deal with an offense first you go face to face privately to the individual and then if they won't listen to you you bring witnesses back with you and then if he they won't listen to the witnesses you you go to the greater congregation to the community of faith\nAnd then if they don't listen then you have to make a determination about this association with that person there's a process\nAnd it's a very careful process it is it is by definition Laden woven with integrity\nAnd the second step in that process is Jesus himself quoting the Old Testament about the necessity of establishing a matter between two or three witnesses so let's go to that passage into ... Nineteen Fifteen Jeff can you jumped that will not force\nYeah got it right here Moses writes a single witness show not suffice against a person for any crime or for any wrong in connection with any offense that he has committed only on the evidence of\nTwo witnesses or of three witnesses shell a charge be established\nSo in the Hebrew Republican the Old Testament law you couldn't just accused a person or something and have that person be convicted on any matter that was brought to law to court any matter\nYou had to have at least two to three witnesses are in fact in regards to capital offense a numbers thirty five thirty is very careful to say especially in regards to a capital offense where someone could actually forfeit their life\nOr in the death penalty no one could be executed upon the testimony of a single individual so whether it's a ... a ... any any crime or a massive crime a major crime a capital crime\nYou can't just do this on the testimony of one witness and and Jesus taught this it there's other passengers all throughout New Testament examples everybody else got any other examples of through the New Testament that speak to you in regards to this idea of two or three witnesses\nWell I'm I'm thinking of the trial of Jesus they brought witnesses but none of them agreed exactly they all gave us a slightly different a version of what Jesus supposedly set and yet they can they convicted in many ways a kangaroo\nCourt but it's an outstanding point though Jeff because even in the very trial of Jesus that was the whole uh objective is they had to get to where they could get multiple witnesses because of the the the in Hebrew process of law you couldn't proceed on an uncorroborated testimony so this\nAll those written way back you also couldn't call a trial in the middle of the night and yesterday and yet that's what they did to a so they can only bring in their hand picked so called witnesses\nSo this notion of of the validity of testimony and corroborating evidence is very deep in the pattern of Old Testament and New Testament understanding\nOf law in a legal processes and so I think we've got a platform from which we can talk about what does the Bible say as well if we witness for the Supreme Court [noise]\nVery helpful starting to the conversation today on the public's where they gave a couple of Web sites they are a pie roundtable dot org and the public square to [noise]\n... ... the mayor's our time and looting clothing budget and tax in all the insurance than the current maintenance\nWhere's the line in your budget that help you made a bill for ... wrong in the air and a lot on today it may be round table dot org enjoyment rowing team then giving every month to get America back on trying to make your monthly contribution to Amy roundtable dot org\n[noise]\nReading them later\n\nFamilies gathered around the table here at the American policy round table and this is the public square today um I I think I heard you say maybe Dave the title this program is does Kevin ... matter\nUh yeah because the point I think we're going to see very quickly is of ... uh certainly uh Brett Kavanaugh mad at matters certainly doctor for better certainly everyone we've seen on TV every member of the Senate every member of the house every member of the media every person\nAll God's Children matter and the question is do some things matter more than that particular individual claim or career or even the question\nAnd well the question is really is the truth yeah what's on trial here that's what I was thinking about right and how do we get to the truth so let's go back to what the ... you know this whole question of what the Bible teaches about the presumption of innocence to corroborate nation\nAnd the necessity of two or three witnesses in courts of law anybody want to guess ... and there's a lot of answers that is why does the Bible teach this necessity why two or three witnesses all the time it's in there for ... why\nWell because if you simply make an accusation and they're automatically guilty you could accuse people of anything and then get rid of your enemies very easily as long as you have enough power to prevent people with it that have agendas\nFrom coming in putting that agenda forward and see and it carried out just based upon one thing 'cause some people don't have a problem uh misrepresenting the truth [laughter] to see their actions carried outlaw effectively\nDavidson at all so imbedded in to the concepts of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution which talks about equal protection under the law how can you have equal protection [noise] if you have no protection against an accuser\nI've I'm I'm with you on all these things I think you can go back to the premise of our country and the promise of our country and the declaration of independence that if all people are in effect created equal\nAnd this is where uh where Atticus Finch made that famous quotation in the movie to kill a mocking bird in which a person was unjustly accused and unjustly convicted\nTo begin with\nThis case should not come to trial of not for ... our own medical evidence crime Tom rubs charged with\nA place a government [noise]\nThere's country or courts grade level courts [noise]\n\n\nIdealist to believe firmly and integrity of our costs about ... ... to me as a living and working\nAre just as your review without ... the evidence that you've heard of ... decision\nFeathers throw this marriage to his family\nCame up [noise]\n...\nOur court rooms every person is equal a creation of God equal under the law I think one of the other reasons the Bible brings up this point of the necessity of two or three witnesses because I'm the lord is very ...\nReally aware of the fact that we live in a fallen state or the necessity of two to three witnesses actually cares within a two presumptions the first is that we're likely the lie now sometimes we end up lying unintentionally to not truth an untruth\nA sometimes we see things incorrectly sometimes we thought we heard something or failed to hear something there is the sense of just a misappropriation of our facilities that leads us to an inappropriate understanding an incorrect understanding\nThat I don't know what is now was it a criminal trial no could somebody go to jail from the outcome well yeah\nIt depends if it ah it causes the local authorities to reopen the gays are open an aunt and that by the way was the understanding as well in the final hours of the testimony in the afternoon one member of the Senate panel explain to the judge that\nThe charges against him were in fact criminal in nature and they both agreed and understood that was also at stake\nSo that would be in a different court but judge Kavanaugh was before a jury of his peers because the Senate is judiciously ... it has the judicial authority according to the constitution to maintain justices who are article three lifetime appointees in good behavior\nSo let's not kid ourselves they could say all they want oh this is a job interview that's not true because if he made a mistake he could be fired\nThrough a a judicial proceeding called impeachment so technically it wasn't a criminal trial but in every other way this man was under trial\nWell and it seemed like there was so much confusion as a place to that on what could happen could judge Kavanaugh if he wasn't confirmed by the Senate\n... was he in danger of losing his job on the federal bench I Know you blogged about it and you talked about it because there's three thousand others\nThat should go through the vetting process but the question as to be asked do we take that confirmation process serious enough or many of those judges just rubber stamped based on being stepped forward to the committee\nWell and the reason that they kept saying this isn't to trial was because they were trying to say hey you could say anything you want here and just say I was at a safe space for him that well there you go they were trying to create some kind of a space if you will that anything can be said here because this isn't a\nCourt of law again that's not true but but even worse than that the whole concept of what we're doing here why would you ever create a space it says well because it's technically not a judge sitting in a criminal court than the rules don't apply well this is my point\nWouldn't have to rules not ever applied when have we ever been in a position in regards to our civil government where the notion of the presumption of innocence\nThe requiring of more than a single witness corroborating evidence and ultimately trying to get to the truth the truth truth of what happened\nWhen are those rules ever supposed to be suspended I mean little kids know that if you get in trouble and you're accused you go up the line and get help right I mean what if this is the the part that that what were they trying to create by saying oh this isn't a trial does anybody else is MS figured that out\nI the only thing I can think of is they were trying to set up a perjury trap\nUm for for judge Kavanaugh ... and it really kind of bothers me that everyone was focusing on what he was saying and how\nHis statements were inconsistent with how he portrayed himself in the confirmation process and very little attention really in the media that I've seen in the aftermath has been given to the lack of credibility of\nDr Ford's testimony in fact the most common description of her testimony as she was very credible\nI that's not true in ... in front and look at factual evidence\nThat's not true within her own statements with ended the testimony itself\nMelanie give us some examples\nWell she for example she said my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends later she said there were four or five parties that my friends and I attended that were also attended by him yet ... testimony her closest friend says she doesn't even know that Kavanaugh or didn't than\nSo ... that's that's a very strong inconsistency\nUm she also um was talking about\nWho who arrived first and that they were already intoxicated when they arrive when later she said she wasn't sure who arrived first\nWell how would she know that if she wasn't sure who got there first\nSo I to me and the um the the most egregious inconsistency\nWas the story that she told her she mentioned that in her comments with the prosecutor\nI'm about her trip to the Potomac village Safeway and then Senator Durbin later ask her to explain more fully what happened that day where she arrived at the store with her mother and she was describing a I'm a chance encounter with mark judge\nAnd she said that it looked like he was working there and arranging shopping carts so am I said hello to him his face was white uncomfortable and\nHe he was saying hello back but he wasn't friendly he was nervous and not wanting to speak with me if you had just been violently assaulted\nAnd you happen to run into one of the two people you say we're doing that as things to you ... why would you walk up and want to have a conversation with that person and surprised that they weren't friendly back it just\nIt doesn't even make sense to me she was she because she described herself in testimony again as having characteristics of panic and anxiety and all of these things so that that doesn't jive yeah you're going to walk up to somebody who just tried to attack you and say well hello good morning\nThen that doesn't make sense doesn't want them to engage with you and just let me ask you\nThis what else about the hearings that you saw a didn't quite set right with you what are the reflections we\nWonder there's been a lot of discussion about when Senator Feinstein received a letter and what was done with it the concern that I had was the talk regarding Senator Feinstein in her office making a recommendation for what attorney\nThat Dr Ford should've chain where she should get council before judge Kavanaugh was even made aware that this letter was out there it almost seems like there was a little bit of conspiring and there's no doubt with Deborah cats becoming the attorney above record for Dr Ford\nIn her representation of the political activity that she's been involved in through the years that just to me it raised my eyebrows to think you know Senator Feinstein is having these discussions offering who she should obtained council from ... but\nNot letting judge Kavanaugh even behind closed doors letting the Senate committee behind closed doors they deal with private things all the time they deal with all kinds of matters of investigation that the public does not know about ... and in that realm I Can't believe it went down this way with that timeline\nWill Rob we were sitting there watching the part of this together down here in the studios in actually looking at you and say how are we watching this right now\nHow is this strained and beamed and yeah the cash to every corner of the nation it seemed like it the whole process was just designed to divide this country and that's the part that really bothered\nMe and my wife and I had the same or saying the same thing at the same time is not surreal I tell you what got me was after judge Kavanaugh made his statement I mean you're looking at a man who is broken okay and then what's the next thing you have Senator Leahy and Senator Durbin\nBearing down on him and you know someone gives the testimony like that\nWouldn't or like anybody wouldn't you have some kind of sympathy buried down constantly harping on ... do you need to be investigated by the FBI or you're going to go for that you're going to be investigated by the FBI the guy's already been investigated six times well\nThat was the amazing thing that they were asked him why isn't he calling for another FBI investigation of himself and it just struck me what did you why would you or you're not going to call for an audit you don't mind if I knew there was nothing to to be found you don't want to go through the process can I please have a root canal\nNegative braking get take a break and we're going to get for the question about are we ever going to get to the truth and we'll we'll discuss that next on the public square [noise]\nBanned [noise]\nWe'll be right back for more on Monday when [noise] Mm [noise] [noise]\nReading on line for\nThanks for your support of the public square which is for them this form this hour long program each week we have a daily program as well as many radio stations both are available online the public square dots [noise] does Kevin no matter what or important conversation to have today in the midst of what's going on in America\nDave well let's ask this question um [noise] the notion of the me too movement is that Dr Ford is entitled to her truth\nAnd I've heard that a number of times in recent years her truth is truth a and and I got to tell you I'm sure doesn't come a surprise to anybody around the table or any of our listeners that I really kind of stumble over that terminology what are you all think when you hear her truth\nOr history that makes me think that whatever they say is accurate as long as they say it's accurate and that is a perversion of what truth as long\nAnd how I'm Norma who was row in the way I'm her whole story was based on false for\nYou know so here we are you have the gravity of that Supreme Court decision having extreme consequences now of trying to hold onto a court that will continue to legislate from the bench\nMelanie it amazes me that her truth Norma ... truth her truth was ally exactly and that the attorneys that she went to coerced her\nIn exchange for help to tell that lie to say she was raped and that's the credit of the roe versus Wade case and in fact she wasn't um do you have that quote\nHandy her her quote\nSo in her testimony to the U.S Senate in Nineteen Ninety eight I'm Norman the core of the state and this is her quote\nThe affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court didn't happen the way I said it did pure and simple I lied\nSarah Weddington and Linda ... needed an extreme case to make their client look pity Abul rate seemed to be the ticket was made rape even worse the gang rape it all started out as a little lie but my little lie grew and became more horrible with each telling\nNow those are the words of normal McCarthy and to the very days of her final passing she worked to try to explain to people at the credit of the roe versus Wade case her testimony was ally she went back to the U.S Senate and so testified she even attempt to get to the Supreme Court and explain that to the court as well\nSo this wouldn't be the first time that we were discovered that someone's truth\nNow our point is when two people come forward one saying a hundred percent certainty this happened in one single how to present certainly didn't I'd like to know\nWho's telling the truth and whose line wouldn't you that way\nEspecially when it pertains to something as important as a lifetime confirmation to the highest court in the United states especially when it pertains to destroying somebody's reputation their jobs their career and their family\nForever especially when it pertains to the underlying premise of our judicial system that you're innocent until proven guilty with evidence not with conjecture not once hearsay with evidence because\nIf you're convicted in the court of public opinion and they can destroy that person's life they can come and do it to you anywhere do anything right yeah well\nWayne this this entire process has turned our nation apart\nYeah I'm just sitting here and I wrote down the words we are divided nation\nYeah torn apart and in some ways from that renting can come he'd like\nBecause if in the renting we come back to first principles and we look at ourselves and say what do we want to become what path where we take what we take the bridge toward the shadow lands or the bridge towards light in truth injustice\nWe have a decision to make another scripture costs people of faith to walk as children of light\nAnd it's in the book of of the Asians chapter five my question is if you went to church last week I did your church pray for America yes did your church talk about this in the context of we need to ...\nFor our country our country is being torn apart we need to pray for our country I regret to admit that the church service I was involved and had no mention at all ... and I fear that that's the case for many mhm now what do we do about this the first thing is we've got to pray\nWe have to pray for our nation\nAnd what's wrong with brain that God will show us the truth\nNo matter what it costs us\nThat we'd be children a flight secondly we've got to see the truth\nNot just pray for we've got to see if we want to know who's lying and we're not going to stop asking you know just like ... year after the terrible shooting that happened in Las Vegas and we're told we still don't know in a motive I'm not satisfied with that right I Want to know why\nI Want to know what happened and why it happened I Want to know if two people stood before God and all these witnesses in the Senate Judiciary committee and all of the media and the whole world and said one hundred percent a hundred percent be I Want to know what's the truth\nAnd I don't plan to stop searching for myself on this and I I don't think our our pedals gonna stop searching I and I don't think the organization is going to stop searching because the truth is more important than doctor for the truth is more important\nThe judge Kavanaugh for Americans our entire existence is predicated upon self evident truths third we've got about ... and boy is there ever a time to note this is even need to be said how important our votes for Congress are today\nAnd that's why we encourage everyone across the country to go to the voters dot com because you'll be able to get all the information on the people that are on your ballot regardless of what state you live in\nA at I've voters dot com we we're not going to tell you to vote for and what not telling you on this radio program who to vote for how to vote but we are hoping that you will go searching for the truth on the people that you will put in elected authority not only view yourself but also of all your neighbors\nWill I can tell you I've been going there almost every day for the past several weeks now and also I've been recommending it to my congregation a pastor's you're not going to get in trouble with the IRS for recommending this non partisan site so just tell them to go there if they have questions\nWe're not going to data mine your information and you're not going to be filled with that I Know the first question right yet is ... how do you guys pay for that there there's no ads they're they're ... what are you doing if that information you're selling you know we're not doing that because of the general supporters of the work of the American policy roundtable that we're able to provide\nThat resource to everyone in all fifty states free of charge to encourage you to go there you can share with your friends and neighbors even the ones that you may think don't agree with you politically there's no political bent to it all the information there can be used by everyone and the candidates\nAre speaking in their own words you can find out and you know it's kind of funny because there's one candidate for the Senate or the ... in the United states recently who\nSort of didn't have an opinion on the question of roe versus Wade huh and I thought to myself how can anybody in America at this stage in life not have an opinion about roe versus Wade it'd be running for the Senate\nI mean there are people who can tend to this entire debacle that we've gone through with these hearings is all about roe versus Wade but on the other side how many people running for the Senate know that normal McCrory told her truth ... which she then acknowledged was alive right in an amplified lie\n[noise] it it's going to take you back to something you said about prayer and churches neglecting some churches neglected to pray some churches didn't pray because they thought it was inappropriate because it crossed into political territory can we talk\nComing I can we can get around for just a moment my goodness Wayne how sad that truth has become political for truth tellers\nJesus Says word it'd be the salt were to be the light of the world\nAre all existence and the great commission is to bear witness to the truth the truth truth that the word of God has been made flesh and the person of Christ and that he offers us\nSalvation for eternity in a way out of hating each other here that we can learn how to love our neighbors we love ourselves and when Jesus Says all authority and haven't heard of this has been given a dummy he means the authority\nOver the judicial proceedings of the United States Senate as well as everything else so I think it comes from a fractured world view on that I think it's something we need to pray for healing\nAbout if you knew anything about the American policy round table in the public square please know that that we believe that very very strongly um I think we're almost out of time on Egypt one more thing\nI just want to ask a question um when didn't God's people decide to run away from the battlefield instead of running toward it wow that aren't battlefield is is in the voting booth\nThat's where we decided the direction that this nation takes 'cause we don't have yet riots in the street to the point of civil war are battlefield\nIs the voting booth and if you're telling yourself you don't you don't feel engaged or you don't you don't like all the all the peripheral issues that are going on in this nation so you're gonna sit home this time than your condemning generations that follow us to a system that is not like the one we inherited\nThat will be the final word on the public square this week thank\nYou thank you for listening listen again online anytime looks weird\n\n\n\n\nWhere the broadcast service and the miracle policy round table [noise]\n\nThursday night you're grabbing race with some friends started off with a pitcher\nHenderson veil Nashville\nStudio where I mean I [noise]\nLoan want him to another edition of memories in hell I'm your host prison McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that of banging each and every one of us and that stress\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's\nOr anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's that's due process and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that\nYou need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it\nReally because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually take into account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei and\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of various I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency spin\nThe nickel magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more rats or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones just start getting all lost you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest it\nWill all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down this great absorption rate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nOr I this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eighty one nine to five seven five now ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd want to let you know the doctor Pincus has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call the shirt I mentioned this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred eighty one nine to five seven five\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of

deficiency is really an epidemic now causing all kinds of health concerns about the issue is even if you're trying to get vitamin D back in your body you're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd documenting is why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D\nThe fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone\nThat should be there and it's not there and the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from sun what\nMakes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all what five thousand units of

six five six three zero\nSo how 'bout if folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body and still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D\nThree is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end as going up and out through the rough where it should be wow\nSo Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nI Would definitely start with kids for development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity cardiovascular\nProblems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones him to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you'd start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning mhm\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every\nSenior citizen would go on a formula\nImagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and I know of clarity you know this is more and more important as we all want because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr bank is such that your fast melt the three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath all in the mirror in the morning and then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people die from from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like that and the sooner you can get on my formula the better I you're going to have of having a really\nHealthy high energy high mobility life from here I Know\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting just what can someone expect when they start taking your fast melts the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that something changing in your body because the kick start so many different cycles and your body that you'll start having less pain having more energy\nAnd having better mental clarity better sleep your mood can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary to get these things running\nWell Dr biggest unfortunately we only have a few minutes left anything else you want to share with her audience here in our final minutes\nFor those of you listening covered a lot of ground\nYou're working with the body of tricky as you know and we're talking to your listeners have your show you know there are all walks of life but all various conditions and so I'm trying to get some good health advice here for the point is and get yourself to get yourself on its formula\nAnd see for yourself it against the law\nFor you to try something to see if it works it's a it's an interesting thought we were talking about nutrition we're not talking about rocket science or write a lot of science behind what I'm Talking about the key is to get on the formula and give it a month or two\nEvery day take one of these things and start the improvements and you're paying your blood pressure your blood sugar energy or sleep habits\nThis is my appeal to your listeners to get on its formula to try it for themselves\nWell Dr bank is again thank you for taking time to uh to be with us today thank you ...\nOr I folks will here is your final opportunity if you want to try Dr ... says

whiplash is you begin to stretch and tear the ligaments in your neck and this is the most important piece of the story\nWhen you stretch into this lady wasn't based part of the neck\nThat is what's
