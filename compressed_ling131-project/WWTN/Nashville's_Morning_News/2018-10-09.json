Thirteen recent comments about a great candidate in the U.S Senate Marsha Blackburn this every ... pop star actor have to have a voice has to voice their political opinion should the world news flash we don't never have never will care\nAnd I think I think a lot of people feel that way\nI'm One of the reasons I liked ... with as an artist wrote one person was because I Believe she did not need to voice or a political opinions I'm very disappointed this is just a list I'm very disappointed as a black man who daughter idolizes you why does everyone feel a need to voice their political opinion\nSo disappointed in you that you decided to play politics I thought you were brilliant when you said I'm not going to tell people to vote for it but I Would encourage them to vote yeah now that that was a good message right there this will with all the divided this country you were the only place where politics didn't matter\n[noise] see I think a lot of people feel that way about about they're entertainers uh you just endorsed a Democrat and the Tennessee Senate race where the ridiculous statement saying Marsha Blackburn is a woman or a woman is against women you have absolutely no idea what you were talking about your career has never recovered since ... ended it [laughter]\nOh well look\nDoes does this matter and the grand scheme of things I'm looking actually found because I have no life I I did a little research a water demographics are overwhelmingly women so if you're looking to energize women [noise] that's true but they're very young\nThey're generally very young I mean her greatest demographic is a a kids who were sixteen to Eighteen so barely able to vote\n'em a lot of them are\nIn the twenty to twenty four right so if you're going to motivate anyone if somebody's got to listen to what Taylor Swift as to say they're going to say wow\nI Taylor said I should not vote that she got her and vote for Bredesen\nYou're you're asking twenty two to twenty four year old women Eighteen to twenty four year old women to vote for a Seventy four year old man I'm In a conservative area a red state does it does to dramatically change things no I I don't think it does\nAnd and so you know tell you what I Know it's not easy being a pop star diva\nAnd you know your ... your wading into waters in which you you haven't spent a lot of time and you're getting a lot of criticism but don't worry tater you just need to\nShake it off\n... get off maybe shake\nOh [laughter] he didn't know I knew all his Taylor Swift stuff that I didn't know that I have a Seventeen

a family owned business for over\nA hundred years I mean let them stop and think about that how do you get to be a company most companies don't survive that long a and and and then to be here a hundred years means something and I think it has something to do with how they treat people they treat them honestly\nStraightforward for example you know when they tell you how much they're going to cost that's exactly how much is going to cost\nAs there is no hidden costs they won't charge extra for a power record or a hose or delivery or haul away\nAnd when you go to the big box stores and you buy an appliance or a piece of furniture are centered around the house they're going to be a price and then you think well that's pretty good price I'll just take that right now but then you find out it's not really the price because they got to add all these other things on\nAnd so at the end of the day you feel sort of ripped off they didn't they didn't deal with me honestly that's not going to
