and what does happen prior decisions that previous courts have made and I know there's been a lot of concerns\nOr from the left regarding decision of roe v Wade in the seventies and not being president precedent and settled law well my question is if they feel that way on one case does that mean every case that's ever been in front of the court and been decided by the court is precedent settled law in the court can never change anything\nWell let me add another extension to that line of thinking that you're going forward let's presume that this nominee had been or the next nominee will be\nFemale\nOpposed to mail that how does that change the entire dynamic let's suggest that the next nominee would be female and of a different color other than white skinned\nAt that that that female non white next appointment would be a from a at Stanford University or a or an Ivy League elitist a cut from Columbia\nUh at let's let's presume that that the next nominee would not have any of the trappings and let's just say that that female nominee perhaps served through her teen years in a notary\nSo that there could be no question of sexual indiscretions whatsoever and she never touched a drink of alcohol and was actually a a ... ... ... lay any other ... let's say that she was as good as the queen of England\nAs far as her integrity encourage Melanie would they still be scratching on the doors at the Supreme Court\nThey would be going back to her teenage years and charging her for tax evasion for babysitting money [laughter]\nWell well as the point\nIs that they see this as a pure loss of political power it has nothing to do with justice being served in accordance to constitutional law because for the progressive left the court has become\nIn essence an extension of their political partisanship it's a division of their party it's a piece of their agenda well\nWhen judge Kavanaugh was nominated to become justice calving off you remember there were people on the left that sent out press releases opposing it in one group\nJust had ... acts were name was supposed to be because they are the name of the name here because they had pre drafted their opposition but they forgot to enter the name\nIn the letter of the press release so they were opposed both foreign name was even given and they have the letters written and they will for the next go run out of an issue it's about power\nThat the other piece of this picture that no one's talking about is the fact that there may be is a shift and I don't even know if it's a huge shift yet in terms of the outcomes of decisions but there's also a shift in terms of what cases are taken because it only takes four justices to say yes to take a case I'm\nGoing to interrupt we're going to take a break here in the

I really do shirt\nIs and that's the next point so here's the question we're talking about are reaping the world but now that is a quote from the Old Testament\nOr the idea that if you so to the wind\nThat you ... to the world went\nAnd of course it's a comment that are now justice Kavanaugh made in his testimony before the committee saying what we're doing here by the process that we're going through\nIs we are so into the wind by doing these that the approach that we're taking now on confirmations\nIs is so into went and we will ... the world when he was trying to say this won't end here what we're doing here is a mistake and it will come back\nIn a volume I Would suggest that what we saw actually was the beginning of the world with no I think we've been showing this since the Nineteen hundreds in the over accelerated over emphasized overvalued power if you will\nOf the Supreme Court that was never designed to be that way in the constitution and it's been ... nippy elated that way by the progressive movement and progressive and understand this\nDemocrat and Republican come bind who have worked against the founding document of the constitution to amplify the influence of the court far beyond it's appropriate role\nYou know proof that we have over valued the Supreme Court\nIs that a few generations ago or let's say early Nineteen hundreds there were no Senate hearings\nFor Supreme Court nominees they simply submitted affidavit that yet there were no hearings now we've turned it into everybody says a media circus but it's an audio visual searches for political agendas\nAre waning them in the monthly update Jeff I I use the terms that this was a show trial that would have made the Soviet Union ... year\nOld boy but Jeff even if they go back to the practice of just nominating and then that person gets a escorted around to all the different offices and ... every Saturday just to have a personal conversation with the nominee and there is no\nQuote unquote hearing as soon as an accusation comes to the forefront is going to be a hearing\nYou know we're not going to get a different we're not going to actually go back in the ... going back to go back for a second\nDon't ask a different question which is how did we get here how did we get here and and that's sort of ... some of the conversation we had an update and and I I I Would prefer that there are three reasons we got here the first is that we abandoned the founding principle of self evident truths\nAnd not only do we band of the founding documents the founding construct of the country but we we abandoned the founding principle of self evident truth we're not living it we so we we we sewed to the to to to moral relativism\nAnd now we are reaping the whirlwind of everyone now is entitled to their truth her truth his truth what ever happened to self evident truths and the world\nWindows in the ... century I mean we're we're getting pummeled by the storm will if\nYou have your truth and I have my truth that was my truth better than your truth\nHow will we ever reach to the consent of the governed if there is nothing that brings us together to a shared belief in a self evident truths\nWe all agree on what the truth is that's the whole premise of the ... of the founding of our declaration of independence was we looked at all these truth claims we've looked at the conflicts that we're in and we found a way out that's based upon a transcendent truth to it which we all agree\nWell and I think we've seen people\nBoth sides of the aisle a act a bit hypocritical when it comes to some things when they've been searching for truth because maybe the truth didn't fit their political agenda\nMaybe we'll see him make accusations against one party or defend\nA colleague based on political preference where they would attack on the other side now there's an irony and all of this because for years we've we've watched I going back to to the Nineteen seventies in French chef for ... someone that I was familiar with and some of the work\nAnd effort a scholarship and ministry of debris that I was was was ... fluent in if you will and I often talk about Dr Schaefer naval she had on my life and my wife's life and and how did that so everybody knows that story\nIt's just a fight that never ends now you say is it does it stop of the court no just like they used the testimony against a justice Kavanaugh\nThey'll ... they are they're using the court\nAs a tool to leverage elect tore laptops and they will lose the electoral outcomes to leverage back onto the court they'll use any tool with in their grasp to get their way\nWe have an example uh shortly after the hearings senator Kamala Harris from California who was on the Senate Judiciary committee came to the key swing state of Ohio\nTo weigh in with the Democratic party at two events a to support democratic candidates in the Midwest particularly in the state of Ohio now this program is her all over the country and we don't tell people who to vote for and I'm a registered independent and this is a fiercely independent organization reporting on the activities of a single political party\nAnd this article appeared in the largest newspaper the state the Columbus dispatch an article written by Darrell rolling who we've known for years who is a credible reporter on politics so this is not about a Republican response\nThis is just what was in the paper Kamala Harris came to Ohio and she spoke specifically about this to rally the troops Rob you got the contest\nShe said the cabin our process was quote a sham and a disgrace let's speak the truth that it was a denial of justice for women of this country a sexual assault survivors\nShe also added quote what we've been witnessing is a display in an exercise of raw power rock power power that as being exercise not just to win but to demean and deflate and defeat and quote\nOkay so now she's doing this to um to to work up the Democrat troops\nIn one case the troops that she was talking to went out and then canvas the neighborhood to register and and get a Democrat of households to vote\nAnd then she spoke to a thousand person democratic fundraiser as well for major candidates and let's say let's go back to her first paragraph of that statement you say that again this is how she this is now she comes from Washington and the Senate committee straight out and here's an interpretation describing\nThe Kavanaugh process as quote was a sham and a disgrace let's speak the truth that it was a denial of justice for women of this country a sexual assault\nSurvivors okay I'll agree with her on the first time or do I I agree with Kamala Harris into it that that that process was a sham and it was a disgrace can I get about ... obviously you didn't have any way I guess however here's what I Would like to I I understand\nWhat does the second part of that paragraph has to do with a Supreme Court a procedure\nWhat do you have is a truth she said let speak the truth or not ... how does she described it\nThat it was a denial of justice for women of this country is sexual assault survive\nThey were projecting on that man all of the sexual assault crimes across the country on to one man\nRight so there's a personal protection my here's my question at what point\nWhat a Supreme Court confirmation hearing be the vehicle whereby you'll get justice for anything it's advice and consent on the nominee it has nothing to do with a judicial proceeding but she claimed that its outcome should have been\nTo create justice for all of it so what would how would you get justice in that process unless it was to destroy\nThe nominee that was their only goal to defeat the nominee they wanted to defeat\nBrett Kavanaugh at any means puff to defeat and to make an example of him to intimidate any\nOther so when the president called\nThe judge Kavanaugh said I'd like you to be my nominee for the Supreme Court and what we're going to do is we're going to let you carry the burden\nOf all injustice in regards to\nSexuality and history of the country and if you win and and your ... you are now going to be the carrier agent of this grave injustice and this nomination process will ultimately be whether or not we agree that women should get justice for sexual violations and that's your job you go now you're the representative you are the carrier did your the scapegoat\nFor all that has ever been created is is I Am I I I Know you're going to be saying what did you sell before you can [laughter] I was talking about the court writing laws here's Congress passing judgment that had to do with the Supreme Court\nNomination said to me that goes back to the first part of what she said that the whole process was a sham it was a sham because of what she stayed in here that ... they created a situation that was impossible\nFor anyone to to righteously negotiated skyline profit it'll it'll lawyers and the nomination round\nO's to uphold the constitution how could she carried this agenda into that hearing well and when she says that she makes it sound like one sided with the other is against sexual assault survivors no man's saying they're against sexual assault is a great point every one would point out how evil that is so\nBefore my head explodes okay in front of God and all these witnesses [laughter] at the point is and I yes it's over it and and no this isn't fiend outrage I just can't I ... and you said when you re played some of the hearings for your wife to what to do\nYou actually cried for our country I did I did not ... I didn't expect to do that I was you know she didn't she is a normal person she didn't have the time to sit and watch all six and a half hours of these proceedings I played her some of it tried to catch her up I was just broken because\nHow divided are we are when I read senator Harris' statement and and then recognized that this is what she's telling democratic operatives in the state of all how to get them to go out and to be involved in politics\nThis one's a lawyer she's the former attorney general of the state of California\nTo to recreate the notion of what a Senate confirmation hearing about the highest court in the land is supposed to be and to use it\nFor such an agenda for any agenda\nBreaks my heart just tells me there was a significant number of people in the United states for who logic facts and ethics simply do not matter\nThat's also why people who who don't pay close attention and they hear these snippets that's what makes them so angry that they want to go out and do something violent it makes it gives them range when they think that people uh some sexual assault victims had been denied justice like I said I was\nTrying to catch my wife up on these hearings and so I went to just uh I won't say a particular news site that I went to but I pulled up their their summary of of of the proceedings\n'cause if you're an editor I mean you know this is my field you can pick and choose which parts of things you want to include in the things that they included from the hearings painted a completely different picture than what actually occurred\nLet's take a break and we'll come back and continue this but as we're talking here Dave I'm thinking about how critical is for our American mission series for people to really come to grips with the constitution understand the constitution even\nThose in political office understand\nBy let's take a break we'll come back we're talking generally from our monthly update and if you'd like to receive the\nLast word on line that the public square and on your\nWe'll be right back for more on the public square\nBy this is David ... of the American policy roundtable would you like to have you\nBack on where the candidates stand for election day\nEvery single year for over thirty five years we work with voters across the nation and they tell us the same thing we want the vaccine will want to know what the candidates stand on the issues and the good news is by voters dot com meets them right on point\nVoters dot com it's an independent non partisan free voter information searching all you need to do is walk on your address the sample ballot will appear racist that you'll see on election day from there you just click on each race candidate the issues pop up and you get the facts from both sides and then decide for yourself\nVoters dot coms fans trees independence waiting right at your fingertips millions will have\nTheir ... election why not joined\nI voters dot com or free voter information service of the American policy roundtable\n... in the mayor's our ties including budget and tax and all the insurance than the current maintenance\nWhere's the line in your lunch and that helped me to do for things went wrong in America are long gone today and it may be round table dot org enjoyment rowing team then giving every month to get America back on trying\nTo make your monthly contribution to Amy roundtable dot org and\n[noise]\nReading the light\n\nLet's get right back into the conversation today on the public square\nThat you inherited did you make it better did you make more people free did you help more religious liberty did you did you see to it that others were treated more fairly did you use the tools that were at your disposal to phenomenal wealth of America in American government to help\nOther people reach the potential I gave them then did you did you avoid the pitfalls of trying to do that with out my word did you apply my word to every area of life like I told you to do and the great commission\nWere you my faithful witness I'm gonna have to I I I don't maybe you don't agree with that I just think we're going to be held accountable\nI read the book of revelation and I see what Jesus Says to the churches there and it scares me ... I mean he's happy\nWell when Jesus is turning over tables or cheeses lecturing or tone it it's usually to the people that claim to be doing the work for him correct the people that should know about the book of revelations seven\nLetters to the church that they're all churches and Jesus and I got an issue with you about this about that and you better fix this\nToo I think he come in for anything at all the rest of them are are falling far short\nI look I'm guilty I I've got to do a better job with what was given to us and and it's the notion that as Christians we should be witnesses and light bears above all of this and when I look at the founding the difference from understanding the founding from studying the founding of America\nNot studying what you were taught in school but by reading the lives of the stories and the words of the founders as you see them escalating above rising up above\nThe partisanship of the hour and trying to do the right thing for their neighbors trying to advance the cause of human liberty Jesus said I came to cap to spray\nDid you help me that's what I feel is going to ask me how did you help me how did you want me spiritually how did you help people come out of darkness and into the light how did you help them to live and according to all that I teach yes that's where the passion comes from Wayne this stuff really matters and therefore voting really matters but\nI'm I'm Glad you're passionate you are I I benefited from it personally and I know many many listeners do as well um let's see we talked earlier about you know changed takes risk what are some of the risk that were taken as an organization I'm thinking of voters right now well are\nThere we go we're taking a huge we started in Nineteen Ninety eight actually we started our very first year of existence doing voter information services and then by Nineteen eighty six we had become the premier voter information in print document that was happening in the country and I hate to use the concerns that that's what we were put more of those things in the mail or anybody else back then\nBut by Nineteen Ninety eight we realized that wasn't going to work\nAnd so we moved to one of the first organizations to go on line\nAnd from Nineteen Ninety eight forward we have brokered I put together an established and developed what we now see as voters dot com and Rob that's your major focus you and I are talking\nAt all to literally twenty four hours a day their emails from one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock four or five o'clock and that's ... ... am side on how to get I voters out to all fifty states\nYeah ah we want to find a more ways to get it in people's hands because we feel it's a great tool and a resource to educate\nThe ... every time someone goes and looks at it the response of the same I had no idea that this was here in this simple for me to use them to share with others\nAnd it's not intimidating to give to others in today's political climate because you're not telling people what to do or how to vote you providing them with a tool they can look up with their own address their own ZIP Code they can also dig deeper than I think see who's giving the candidates money they can see who's endorsing\nCandidates with organizations they agree or disagree with\nNow where we started we were in one region than in one state in our in fifty states we don't have every election is that would be\nThousands upon thousands of Kennedy time Romney thousands you cover now you know was well over ten thousand well over ten thousand Kennedy's we would like to have every judicial race every county commission race every school Boris we don't have that yeah we do is we start from the state legislature your state rep up to the White House why\nBecause our focus is on the legislative branch\nBecause that's where all the power supposed to flow from and to get back into this game get back in at the place where it's most important get back into the article one stuff which is the way the founders put this together so there's a strategy to at all we don't data mind people we help you get the information we don't tell people who to vote for\nAnd and I've tried to hide I and and Rob keeps saying you can't do that I and I won't do that we had a conversation about the ballot issues in Florida and how we deal with the ballot issues in Florida\nAnd it for example if you are right now worried about voting Florida you got a mess you got twelve ballot of homework to do a lot of homeland I voters and I would say let's let's just make a list and tell people to stuff work for and against some ballot issues because we're allowed by law to do that we could do that but I have four AM conversation of emails that would actually start one thirty in the morning\nAbout could we do more could we do more and you held the line and it's only God Knows what as you are right we don't even tell you who to vote for on ballot issues even though legally were permitted to do so\nAnd I want to tell them how to vote on ... I really didn't make it quicker and we'll get a thousand phone calls saying just tell me who tell me to vote for and how to vote but I also understand that we have to do a better job teaching I have to do a better job teaching others so they can look and read and make the decision and then they can teach their neighbor\nSo you've got enough information for example and twelve ballot issues that if you're willing to go there stick around for a little bit you can figure it out yourself in language that is understandable that takes a lot of work when it takes a lot of money and it and if it wasn't for charitable contributions because by the way nobody who uses I voters pays for it\nAnd there's no advertisement and the non partisan and here's this coming so to speak to pay for this right churches can lift the Lincoln there bulletins they can you can you can share this link any way you want because it's non partisan and we have a team\nOf part timers and volunteers help put this into action that's what people can't believe when they go to the site off people come up and say what what's the budget on this what's it ... how many million are you spending yeah yeah well if I told you about our Web developer and I'm not going to give his name because I don't want you to take [laughter]\nI'm In the work because he does when they email I'm On the week you and I had that conversation I'm emailing him directly I'm misreading emails that hey we need to make we need to change his he had to change within the hour and then change back let me tell you and that was really good\nPeople who criticizes for the ... you can be so much more sophisticated in that little black board thinking that little stick man why don't you what they thought so primitive guess what\nThat's by design civil works this his fourth grade voting because we know people don't have time we actually have people that are dedicated to helping us bill at the psych who will candidly admitted they spend Fifteen minutes every year on election stuff\nAnd that they're going to put this site together so that their Fifteen minutes has maximized okay and that's fine with us because like Melanie taught us for years if you can't handle the twelve foot and get into the twelve inch and we'll take you where you are and put one plus one is too\n'cause we're not after your money were not even after your vote\nWere after your heart we want you to be empowered as a citizen in the process\nWe're talking about Web design and the developer said you know I'm very concerned on what it looks like on the phone because people were going to be like me and I'm just going to pull it up when I'm In line to vote and that's where I'm going to look\nSo I Want to see that happen I Want to make sure it looks great on the phone I said that I get that and I understand that we go to vote as our teams stretched out over the country and we get these reports all types of saying guess what I saw him to take pictures of people instead of the line do and I voted for what was that yeah well when you think about Florida when you think about North Carolina when you think about Ohio there ...\nPennsylvania intended only so many of these\nStates there's critical ballot issues that are going to be for every voter and that's where some homework and research you want to do that before you get to the voting but\nSowing the bottom line is upset about what you just saw with the Supreme Court the answer is for we the people to change this debate change the dynamic and re empower elected officials who are going to stand for the constitution as we stand\nFor the constitution with them because that's where accountability truly comes from well what a great\nConversation here today one that I Hope you will share with other people that may not have caught this on the radio the way that you've caught it or download the podcast or use a smartphone app the public square but to pass this onto them make sure that everyone gets to hear the public square this week I'm Wade Shepard along with the team here of\nDave's and now they just centers ...

even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr paint is this going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative

a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that\nYou need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing\nIn order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it

there\nYeah there's a vicious circle\nThat I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spin the nickel magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium and that\nAnd that started to take the calcium out of the bones just start cutting bone loss you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually

should really be aware of this because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even

back in your body\nYou're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way and maybe not even getting enough of it and Dr biggest why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone\nThat should be there and it's not there and the statistics show that back in the seventies when we started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside and most of us get no vitamin D from the shot\nWhat makes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nWell Chris first of all what five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet they can actually feel the difference second I use the right type of vitamin D in my

G. M. P. certified lab which means current good manufacturing practices\nAnd this is an FDA mandated set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently after he came in and did an infection and they said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your fast smelled the three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWell he has diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin and the bodies but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D three does is it takes that problem\nAnd it seems to fix it now they've studied vitamin D three and it didn't prove this insulin signature by sixty percent and just to give it a comparison the most popular diabetic drug\nAnd only a few cold this toll free number it's one eight hundred\nFor seven six five six three

why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end as going up and out through the rough where it should be wow\nSo Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important\n... people in their forties that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you'd start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body and

church\nAnd said hey dot your doctor bad right now I really want to hear from you guys listen six one five six years six one two three three that six one five six or six one two three three\nDo not wait I'm ... and make sure that you get in there wasn't so that'd be the puzzle is I Want to talk about neck pain first said it is for a second I'll be able to understand how neck pain really works they feel like your neck of staffing sort\nOf well why does your neck gets stiff us or will generally speaking we have all these blood pressure issues um started ... whiplash issues post sports\nThree but we also live in the modern era of computers cellphones TVs and cars\nYour posture of as being all over your computer hunched over ... launched over a plus any whiplash\nAnd sports injuries car accidents did you ever have is it really a deadly combination for your neck so what happens is that your your next from front to back has seven strong ligaments that help keep it stable what does ligaments job you're looking at as one job and that is to keep your neck from\nUh from sliding around it keeps it stable your muscles really have one job and that can that is to move your neck well guess what if you have a whiplash\nAnd you stretch in tears ligaments in your neck\nNow you're ... they're not able to do their jobs so your muscles jump in and what did they do well your muscles jump in and stabilize your neck when they say ... your neck is what that feels like stiff and sore if your neck is unstable because you'll ligaments are stretched into warm\nThan those muscles now have to come in and be stabilized for your neck well that hurts after a while your neck gets tired by the end of the day uh your neck pain headaches um and it causes what you're dealing with generally speaking and your neck gets sore and now the problem is is left on corrected left unchecked\nWhat's your body does to heal from a torn ligament is developed arthritis\nPeople did not realize that people think that arthritis has to do the genetics my dad had arthritis I'm going to get arthritis arthritis has absolutely nothing to do with how with your genetics has nothing to do old you are\nGenetic arthritis has only to do with how old your injuries are so that makes sense how long have you ever have been unstable so if you're ... fresh you know fresh whip lash and you fix it and re stabilize those limits you sweat you never have reversed right is you're not going to be just fine\nBut if you have a whiplash that you've left unstable for five ten Fifteen Years you're going to wind up developing arthritis in your neck\nI must tell you right now that's the most exciting piece of the puzzle for us and that is that we as our car practically every specific corrective techniques you know I've spent my professional career making sure that we can figure out how to\nUm correct and re stabilize ligaments and if we can reach their bodies are ligaments and that means we can do a ton of stuff we're going to stop your neck from developing arthritis I don't care how bad your arthritis is maybe your nearly bone on bone on ... as long as you have a sliver of a disk and your neck\nAs long as you've got anything in there we can stabilize that stopped the degeneration process were increased you're a range of motion and um it just makes you feel better so that is the specific\nTechnique that we run our office or we have before or just what we do loosening exercising their judgment\nThere would strengthen exercise ... bringing home with some exercise as well because we don't want to just randomly adjustments fine and we want to do is we want to move the vertebrae in the correct position and then re stabilize the muscles Lincoln was attendance so that it stays that way permanently
