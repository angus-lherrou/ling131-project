they were going to be talking about an issue that have been each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on

has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr pick is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research\nYou need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system\nAnd one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes you ... do actually fill the relaxation after your drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking the ... formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas that like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spending Nick we make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more depressed or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting all lost you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest at\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it\nThe cop take a taste of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down this great absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nOr I this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's\nOne eight hundred eight one nine to five seven five ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your blood

if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael pink us on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of this because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing to do their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you know to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] not your bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain calcium many of them is excellent\nFor back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually how the translators and the nerve and when you take us combat formula many times they will calm your back paid wow\nI Know I I have a couple of years ago I heard he ate at a desk in my back ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the cow backs formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour I Would functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period and it it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you have even had bypass surgery\nYou should be on this complex formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing [noise] um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joined her body it'd be entering yeah could be under knack it could be in her\nElbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of uh the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer making it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I used that is what the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes you within us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up and their mothers were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and that add to that the medication as\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system\nSo that very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body and experience and because of the fish and in many of them it's also blocking\nFurther absorption something so it's really it's really a rat race and simply the vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going to do so I might have formulas try the things that are simple first yeah you have nothing to lose this is not going to hurt you put it that way yeah nothing to lose\nOr iPhones again if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ...

different forms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is the activated form so it's ready to\nGo to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients\nPlus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the dean is going to end up going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melt lead them in the formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and the humidity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong\nMen and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity cardiovascular problems start to turn it on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties that's the way you know you start taking more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting
