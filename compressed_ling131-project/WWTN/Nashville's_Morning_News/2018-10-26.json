the threats mailed to Democrats and supporters could actually explode over the past two days or treating this as domestic terrorism Steve ... says among Republicans in Congress calling for all the finger pointing to stop\nThis isn't what America is all about you know I'm disturbed by the fact that it's happening over and over again or you shouldn't just call it when it's against your own party in the silent when it's against the other party we have to be equal and how we denounced is there's no place for this any kind of violent acts in American Fall to several\nAnd I'm In benefits and you get into\nThe last category where they receive on average eleven thousand seven hundred dollars worth of benefits but they're paying Seventy five thousand dollars a year in taxes that's the the upper income people\nFolks this I mean I I Know the numbers are confusing but the bottom line is you know basically a three fifths of the country\nTakes more than they give\nFifths of the country is taking more from our government than we give where did\nGet out of whack what happened in America where it became you know American just sit on your body with your hand out\nWit when do we get to the place in America where hard work yeah I don't know hard work is hard\nI don't really want to go out there I mean I'm just going to give it all to the government anyway\nYou know I mean there there are people who just come to that conclusion that you know what I I can sit here and not work and and I'm not going to be hungry you know my wife may not be I may not be flying around the country on a jet but my gosh I I can make I can make it\nUm I don't like the idea of income redistribution\nI I I Believe that the American dream is that we have an economic system by which if you go out\nAnd you make good decisions with your life and you put your nose to the grindstone and keep your head down you can find success and America\nThe American system never promised you a Rose Garden the American system and the way of life\nWas designed by our founding fathers to give you the opportunity to prosper\nYou get the opportunity but now it seems to three fifths of Americans are are at the point now where they are taking more than they're giving and\nThey're not taking advantage of the blessings of liberty which is an economic system that it can allow you to prosper if you apply yourself I I have an overall arch overarching theory about this and it's pretty simple\nLife is not that hard life is not that hard here it is every day you wake up\nAnd you are you are presented throughout the day with a series of choices one must make I think the first one and I talk about this all the time I think the first one is do I have this news alarmed or to get up and start my day\nLeave me that when you get up at three o'clock in the morning there are many days you want to have this lose all our but you don't you get up and you start the day and you know I I then then you've got to make\nA decision about you know when at work and everything else if you if you make more good decisions when they're presented than bad decisions I think generally you're going to do OK\nRecognize that you write a decision point make the best decision you can make at that moment and hope that you make more good than bad ones then the other side of it is get a job\nPut your nose to the grindstone do a good job for somebody and and then sit back and and and allow the prosperity to come your way because it will\nIf you apply yourself you'd you'd take the the God given talents that you have to find something that you can do that you like to do and go out there and just work hard every day successful\nCome your way I mean I have been and I and I everybody says\nWell it's easy for you say will send you do your your big a big old corresponding you've got a big radio show\nYou make a good living yes I I have I have worked really hard to make a good living [noise] ah and I want to tell you though there were days when I made\nAnd I'm not making this up a grand salary of in my starting days and radio of four hundred dollars a month I was I was so poor I qualified for food stamps I didn't even know it I didn't think to ask\nYou know I was hungry I could use the flow food now and that but but somehow\nYou just kept my nose to the grindstone and then the next job was a little better than the next job a little better next jobs a little better get to the point you know where I'm doing okay\nMore than okay and and I'm mentally blessed but it wasn't always so and\nSo I look at these numbers and I and I really wonder how long as as Americans we can survive when we're in a situation where\nMost people in America more than half are taking more from the system than they are putting out\nI'm not all about taxes I mean they've they've made the when the ... when the income tax man comes in the I just pay I don't ever challenge them back the other day I got nothing from the IRS set a you miscalculated your taxes we think yours three thousand dollars more\nA wasn't fun but I wrote them a check for three thousand dollars it's not just don't I don't even want to fight with them you know I feel so good about being an American and the things that I have that you know even though my taxes are high I Want to pay them but we're getting to a point in America where this whole thing is about
