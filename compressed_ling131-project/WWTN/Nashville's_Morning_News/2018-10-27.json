going to be talking about an issue that have been each and every one of us in that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects the daily stress has on

continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nTo simply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with now what happens is that\nYou need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd the cats sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for\nPeople that have trouble sleep it really because it relax your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the uh after you drink a cup of the ... formula interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who aren't paid okay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies\nActually taking the ... formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person\nHas a magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever right that that's what I Would think that\nWhat happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting phone line is you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah in your body that actually starting to manifest it\nWill all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and is and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's in a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is kept out this great absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nOr I this was probably a good time folks if you want to

that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of this because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late [laughter]\nNot your bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for

under knack it could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize are really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a\nBeautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who

that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer making it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use it with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes you with us before they're event so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles work in rural relax shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medications that many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium may need them in the system you know the very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because the fish and in many of them\nIt's also blocking

Clinton popping up in the world why is my knee hurting so much and then you know normally clean it'd be clean and to go away and then finally after about a year that\nI realized oh my gosh\nThe reason I'm having all the issues because\nOf my inflammation and honestly to this day and it's been nine years later if I started jumping up my diet with a bunch of grains and sugar my knee will start clicking popping it's a very real thing so I Know there's a lot of people at home right now they're like oh man maybe that is me you know I'm hoping there's some light bulbs that are going off\nSince I was considering\nWhat what was the best to be on the radio dot has been\nYou know you're just out into the show when we were talking about in the nation inflammation kill you are so many have you with our reading\nPainting painting your fingers joints shoulders knees or elbows man if you're somebody to deal with heart disease maybe you're on Staten medication you need to be paying attention to this show I'm Talking about exactly what causes the pain and we're talking about how to remove that pain\nFirst of all what causes it real simple inflammation is caused by eating sugar and grain no sugar will kill you we all know that um sugar and grain so when you eat it says you're eating\n'em by the way the number of promises when we left to last segment what is the number one source of inflammatory I'm a food in your whole lifestyle by far in America can yell guess what are you the number one source of information\nOr not grade Joshua Greene he's wrong\nUm it it actually soda is you know that in sodas and then one source of sugar in the United states but the worst part about so does not even say sugar it's a ...\nOf sorts high fructose corn syrup it's in our sodas and it will kill you met is so deadly for a cause inflation your arterial wall um it causes cancer cells as a matter of fact there's eight times as many receptor sites for\nUm sugar on a cancer cell is a regular cell that's why when you go to get a cancer stand on a PET scan what they do is actually inject you with radioactive sugar and that radioactive sugar finds its way to guess what your cancer cells\nAnd then gives off that radiation so they can tell you where the cancer is because cancer loves sugar so obviously you're not only does it cause inflammation and it spurs on cancer is not good things that cause inflammation also cause cancer\nI'm not good no boy do me a legal so what are we gonna do about it well omega three there's really you know five major things that we talk about 'em to remove\nThe information number one is fish will we talked about it and you want a good source thought super high in vitamin a we recommend one called Carlson cod liver oil we actually sold in the office I'm at a well health centers and ah we saw that with us will sell a really great kids one um they're all flavor they're called the robot the flavor it's they don't taste of the fishing is\nUm if you're familiar with all the rules they taste disgusting but this these are pretty awesome\nWe feed the kids and so we do\nUm smoothies guys if you're a smoothie recipe I'm every morning I a smoothie and it's not a movie that's full of fruit and junk that's gonna make you hungry in like five minutes\nIf they committed it will fill you up and I say fill you up and listen I'm a triathlete also do CrossFit stuff although I'm not a big muscular fellow my metabolism is ridiculous my body burns close to four thousand calories a day\nIn my smoothie winds up being like you know Thirteen fourteen hundred calories of course they want to teach you that quite that big a but this thing fills me up for breakfast I always uh fill me up is anti inflammatory it allows me to work a work at a busy level\nUm to have a lot of activity in my life physical activity in my life and not be eat up with inflation it's also a anti I'm\nA cancer smoothie heart disease moody and also if you have any

from the University of TV uh avocados um are very very important reducing inflammation flaxseed oil and then there's something we call her humidity to mark\nI'm not sure if you're familiar with that

Jimmy Boy your uh your um your numbers are looking great I think that we need to probably start decreasing you off of your blood pressure medication\nAnd Jimmy uses ... been the best part is that I hadn't been taking my blood pressure medication for about four weeks to stop taking the medication\nAs a medical doctor who was telling him that he's doing so good he needs to needs to stop taking medication which he already had\nIn the best part is he's changing his diet uh he lost about Fifteen twenty pounds I'm even to that point had been about six weeks she says my arthritis pain gone my headaches are gone he says I feel like a million bucks Jimmy probably one of our best advocates in the office he's always refer people and so we want you to be like Jimmy if you're like that\nAnd

medication does not fix you\nUm it doesn't even reduce in your heart disease all it does is reduces the symptoms if your body is telling you that something is wrong it is using your blood pressure to get your attention something is not right\nIf blood pressure medication fix that problem maybe one or two pills or fix it or a bottle would fix it but it doesn't you wind up having to take how much of that medication\nAll of it for the rest of your life around blood pressure medication wind up not only just you're one of having to take more of it because it stops being effective\nIf you're tired of

talk hidden fees how often do\nPeople come in that you meet with how often do they just simply not know the fees that they're paying\nWell it is is the large majority of the time I mean once in a while they'll come in and they'll have a fairly good idea of what their fees are met a lot of times they don't [noise]\nAlmost everyone understands their their management fees in terms of what they're paying their broker and that's something that typically runs about one percent\nBut when we talk about fees were were not just talking about what you're paying your financial advisor or your broker we're talking about all of their internal cost inside of the funds which is which is an add on to whatever you're paying your advisor [noise] so I Would say it's very\nVery seldom and then what I mean is there an average fee that people listening and go okay I can I Know if I'm above or below that fees or magic number there\nWell I mean it really depends on your investment structures what you have but I I Would say that that the most people are are paying two to three times more than what they think are that's not always the case but in most cases they they are and you know when you when you think about\nWays that people can find out what their fees are that's a question I get asked a lot you know how do they know what they are well if you're a mutual funds for example and and they're certainly opportunity for that certain points\nThere are expense ratio and there will be one fees and transaction cost and where you find those are in the perspective is now I think people should read the prospect of says there's good information in there but most people when you survey them if you if you ask them what they do with her perspective as a\nThey may glance at them but most of them ... or they'll throw them away\nAnd what I tell them is that if they just look at the the area or section there's going to be a list the fees that they're paying\nAnd you've got to add those up and so if they don't know uh what those are are they don't want to read the perspective says that's part of the analysis that we do for people\nIs we can take someone's portfolio what they currently have and we can tell them it's not sort of pie in the sky stuff for opinion It's MORNING Star Wars and things that are very credible we can actually take their portfolio we can loaded into morning star and it's going to tell us what they're paying an internal cost\nSo for example just this last week I did one of these for a couple who thought they were paying one percent that was actually there their managers fee which is the average\nUm so I don't think that's overstated or anything like that\nBut there are internal cost of their phones were one point nine sex so they're actually paying close to three percent\nUm versus the one percent that they thought they were paying and so there are ways for you to find out how much you're paying and you need to because the thing about paying too much and fees is like a double edged sword if your return is eight percent and you're ... structures three you're netting five\nWell if the market's down ten percent and not saying the market's going to go down ten percent\nFace don't get wave and in the bad years so they add to the last so\nFees and taxes and now we're going to talk about taxes later in the show today those are I Believe fundamentally to the biggest they use of your portfolio performance having too much and fees not understanding it's a double edge sword and paint too much in taxes but you can in fact I Know what you're the structure is and you should know which are the structure is very\nVery important so if you do find that out so you read read through your your documentation that you get on a monthly basis and you read through that you find that out and what can someone do is there a way to negotiate or to alter or those fees that they're they're being charged the pain into well\nYeah you can look at even if the sectors that they're in for example are sectors you feel like are are are good places for them to be you can look for other similar performing funds that are at a lower cost or you can look at certain investments that have a better\nTax efficiency or structure for a couple so for example one of the other things again and not to get in his taxes what if you have a mutual fund what's the turnover how many times is their internal trading going on in in in the fund that you don't know about and so if you can have similar a return with a lower cost\nLower turnover fun if in fact mutual funds or where you want to be and there's certainly many other options then you're probably going to keep more money in your pocket so if if two phones were equal in terms of performance\nAnd one was one percent last year going to have a better return because you're paying less than fees and so it all connects us all very very important to understand those things\nAnd I I'd say an additional one percent back in your pocket is a is a big deal well you can go far with\nThat yeah so let's just calculate that for just a minute so one percent is not insignificant\nSo for example if if you have a half a million dollars that's five thousand dollars a year if you have a million dollars that's ten thousand dollars a year that would be fifty thousand dollars over you know the next five years it'd be a hundred thousand dollars over a ten year time period and so\nThe numbers really start to add up so if you have a million dollars that you could save one percent on\nAnd keep a hundred thousand dollars more in your pocket over the next ten years what can you do with that what what'd you do with that and so the numbers do they're not insignificant and so one understand with the percentages and then I Want to understand how that applies to my family and my situation\nYou know that's good 'cause a hundred thousand dollars could buy a lot of ... a lot of shampoo for the U.S this call a

coming soon to Murfreesboro right there all the medical driving the avenues just so they can now we can be more conveniently located for a ... friends up there\nSo today we're talking about retirement blind spots and we'd gone through several different things you talked about hidden fees not having affordable can tax plan not knowing your retirement number\nNot optimizing your Social Security income and we're ready for a fifth on the list and that is not factoring in longer life expectancy or simply outliving your retirement plan\nFor John I guess some people find themselves kind of maybe living in the past where they they can remember their grandparents or their their parents that they put together maybe a five to ten maybe a stretch Fifteen year retirement plan and that's simply won't do any more because we've got people in retirement there\nNeed to put together a plan of twenty thirty forty plus years mhm so when someone comes in and how did you help them determine\nBasically how do they keep from outliving their retirement plan well\nThat's the number one concern of people in America today it's been a couple of years ago now but Wall Street journal poll\nWhere they they pulled the boomer generation and they said how many of you are highly confident that the plane you have today is going to get you know to retirement but through retirement supporting your lifestyle that survey said was that eighty three percent of the boomer generation that's a generational Seventy million strong retiring at about ten thousand a day in America\nThey were not highly confident and the truth is that there is no reason for that because you can be highly confident\nThat you're going to be able to sustain your lifestyle and you know it's interesting part of it just begins with with education and preparing people for the fact that that they could be retired longer than they're working we have clients now that have been retired and longer\nThan they were working and people are just living or you know Nashville's an amazing community the health care that we have here is phenomenal the advancements and health care across the board people healthy they're active here\nAnd you know none of us are promised tomorrow anything can happen\nBut we want to plan for a very long a retirement and we want to have a good retirement you know Social Security for example when it first started life expectancy is we're we're handful years seven or eight years and now people start Social Security is sixty two and they're still taking Social Security and their nineties which is one of the things that\nThis was some stress on the Social Security trust and and that's a whole other topic\nBut you you really need to plan for a very long retirement in particular\nIf you're a healthy couple and let's say you're in your mid sixties or some longevity studies that suggest that women in particular\nAre are going to live well into their nineties if they're relatively healthy and their their mid sixties\nAnd so but even for men you know I have a lot of men that will come in and see me they'll say well you know my father died at Seventy and I don't plan to live much longer than that you know and then they wake up one day and they're eighty or eighty four and they're still living independently and they're still\nYou know talking about work it out I I have a client who works out every day and he's eighty three years old and and you know he would turn circles around me so people are just living longer\nAnd so this plays into how you want to make choices on everything that you may you know we talked already about Social Security but you know if the husband is the ...\nOr income earner you a lot of times they'll look at Social Security choices for example or pension choices through their life expectancy but I encourage them if their wife is is healthy to look at things through their wife's life expectancy because statistically\nUs man you know I'm forty seven my wife is forty should kill me if she knew I was saying that on on the radio she's older she's rocking the cradle yeah but the reality is my wife is more than likely going to far outlive me you know your wife is going to far outlive you and so\nWhen I make choices on assets I Want to make those based on life expectancy is I have a grandmother who died six years ago she was Ninety seven I have one remaining who lives independently who\nIs almost Ninety five years old so you've got a plan for a long life expects\nThe John as you know inflation you know and he doesn't make teams at one point nine percent and\nIt's been a ... percent in two thousand sixteen into them Seventeen and the forecast is around that two percent mark again for two dozen Nineteen and twenty twenty\nSo I I can only assume that inflation certainly plays a major factor when looking at making sure we don't outlive are expecting say so how do you guys factor that into someone's retirement plan that's huge\nI mean it's absolutely huge and the question I Want to ask is do you have a written inflation plant because that's something we do for every one of our clients because you know if your standard of living and I'll just throw a number of there's five thousand dollars today I that's not going to stay at five thousand dollars I mean just think about\nHow things have gone up just in the last ten years I mean ten years ago it was a gallon of gas not what it is today how much how much was milk ten years ago five years ago two years ago you know things go up over time\nAnd you know when you talk about roughly two percent inflation been one of the things I Would add to that is that what the the fed tells us or the federal government tells us is inflation is around two percent and what they're talking about there and that is true\nIs core inflation but ... does does not include\nFood and energy and so if you think about someone who is retired what're to the biggest line items to your budget well their food and energy you don't retire and stopped going to the grocery store fill your car up with gas when you travel\nOr pick the grandkids up you you know you don't stop heating your house in the winter ... and the summers of food and energy our\nOur massive budget line items to retirees and that anyone in America so when you when you add those and we believe true inflation is much closer around four percent and so\nWhat I Want to make sure of is that I have a written income plan I have a written inflation plan that if my expenses are five thousand dollars today that is going up for a true cost of inflation or my spending ability at a later point in life and so that that's really really important and you know another factor to this whole inflation conversation\nAnd they can make a choice whether you're comfortable with that or not and sometimes\nPeople will say I'm very comfortable with the rest of that I haven't and there's sometimes people say wow that's a lot more risk than what I thought that I had so if you did have more risk than what you thought you had or what you were comfortable with it at this point\nWhen would you want to know about that would you want to know about that now when you could still make choices or would you want to know about that down the road when you had little or no choices that is what\nA risk analysis does so why do you think it's so easy to kind of neglect preparing for risk when when we're kind of in this bull market what makes it so so hard to to sit down and look at the risk\nWell a lot of it as emotions I mean del bar is one of the most leading a research turns out the studies investor behavior and\nYou know people are very emotionally driven or they feel really really good and for almost when the market is going up and feel really really bad when the market is going down and they they want to believe that they they buy low and sell high but for most people they they buy high when they're feeling comfort and they sell low when they're feeling pain and\nWe think that any investment decision made out of fear of emotions is a bad deal for the consumer you should never do that with bacon or or anybody else\nBut you know it's it's one of those things that if the market is doing really well you feel like it's always going to do really well and markets are not designed to just go up forever nor they designed to go down forever I mean\nYou know uh it's usually a once in a while we'll we'll have some of them come in and say well you know I was got this email the other day and somebody was telling me how the economy is going to crash and burn and\nAnd I should sell everything I have and buy a bunch of gold coins or something like that and or they've got the perfect place I can put all my money and typically what you'll find somebody that selling a newsletter or book or something like that there there is no perfect answer\nOr what needs to happen is you need to understand your risk and if there is a downturn and you're retired or you're close to retirement as your income going to be there\nBecause what really hurts people in retirement in my opinion is not market downturns because those happen\nIt's market downturns combined with the loss of income or having to sell securities when the market is really low so if if I have a good income plan I'm not having to sell my risk based assets\nAt a low and I'm probably not as concerned if I Know I've got income coming in so it all kinda fits together but it is important to understand that risk\nWhat you mentioned this a little bit you know and that's when the question and it brings us to kind of lost the blind spot on the list\nAnd it's a big one is procrastination I'm this is this is such like you said it's very common it's come and particularly when there's a bull market we're in it's common for people to be looking to to make a change to to give that extra measure of preparedness on their plan\nAnd so I mean I Believe all the folks tuned in today show would agree that retirement and was planning is extremely important or they simply wouldn't be listening to the show 'cause I don't want to just here are pretty voices\nSo why is it so easy for them to stay on the sidelines when it comes to retirement planning and not just jumping in and and kind of grabbing the bull by the morning going on I Want to get this right I Want to be very ... and when my plan well\nI I think there's a lot of reasons for that I think you know first and foremost in a life gets busy um you know I've got three young boys ah that that all play soccer and a family and ... and obviously work in my church and\nYou know generally speaking people are are incredibly busy\nUm but they also kind of feel like I'm you know there's there's so much information they ... they don't know how to decipher it all and that's why planning takes\nTime it's not an immediate decision with us or anyone else or certainly shouldn't be I think a lot of it is is a lack of understanding that's why I Believe our process is is unique in the sense that it's about educating people about getting data into their hands\nBecause the truth is we want people to understand what they have and what options they have regardless if they do business would be can or not\nYou know sometimes I feel like they can't afford it you know when you when used phrases like full service wealth management and we have a CPA in a state attorney and were financial advisors well you know I come from a farming family average household income or where I'm from is about forty thousand dollars a year so you know I'm I'm blessed to live in Williamson county uh here in Nashville\nAnd ask for the most part it's a great place to live but I understand what it's like to grow up in that field I Can't afford things and so the truth is you can always afford to have a good point and then its analysis paralysis we call it you know people just get stopped\nAnd you know the the fear of of something new and it's not easy to sort of barrier financial soul out to somebody that you don't know or or maybe feel like um there's some embarrassment there may be that you haven't planned well or whatever\nBut the bottom line is um you need to take action 'cause procrastination will cost you know this is even to us is very biblical you know clearly they asked us has a ... eleven forces\nWhoever watches the wind will not plant whoever looks at the clouds will not read and I you know regardless of whether you're a person of faith and that's got a lot of truth to it you know if you don't take action you're you're never going to know whether your situation can be improved or not and you may find and going through the analysis that we offer\nThat you're exactly where he needs to be I just met with a guy to day they came in\nAnd it was a very unique you came in really good guy told me that he had been to all kinds of dinner seminars and things like that and he said I've never followed up with anybody and he said there was something about yours that intrigued me\nAnd I wanted to come in and I wanted to show you what I have and what you thought\nSo we looked at what he had and um we talked for a good bit and I looked at him and honestly I could not improve it he had really done a phenomenal job for his family had an incredible plant had work with someone in another state and then moved here recently\nAnd you know what I really respect that sometimes we can't help people they don't want our help 'cause they don't need our help but there's a lot of people out there that they're never going to know if they don't take that first step\nSo if we can help you will tell you that but if we can and will be able to show you that your research and through process because we believe that's really important\nTo John in the beginning the McCall today six one five three nine five three thousand unscheduled visit um I mean if you're
