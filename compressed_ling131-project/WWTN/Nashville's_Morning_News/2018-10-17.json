go to the polls and and as I mentioned early voting starts today\nIs amendment one and Davidson county which would set up a police oversight board is this a good idea or a bad idea\nI it is a is a very strong opinions on both sides in certain parts of the community they believe that there is more oversight of the police department needed a and and there was a racial element to those concerns let's just be honest about it many in the black community are having issues with the police department\nA and they want to see some oversight however I Believe that's a political process and I and I raise some concerns and I raised some questions about whether or not it's a good idea to have people who have a a a political animals\nAre concerns involved and looking at the the day to day operations of police officers\nThey are the now the apple pie the fraternal order of police believes there may be constitutional issues\nOr I Know that I Know with great interest that even\nDynamic mayor David ... of Nashville is officially against this idea of an oversight board he doesn't like the language he doesn't mind the idea of having some kind of community board but the way the language is apparently written he has some concerns about\nThe police officers have concerns about it so how do we find that middle ground here I don't think this was the right answer and here's what I think uh why I Would ask you to think twice before voting for the oversight board\nPolice officers have a tough job they have to make decisions in a matter of nanoseconds milliseconds they have to they have to make a decision about what is the right thing to do in a matter of seconds\nIt's a little unfair I think the incoming presume that they that there was some kind of a malfeasance at play\nAnd and then with the with the the uh the benefit of twenty twenty hindsight\nAnd lots of time to analyze every bit of what has happened\nYou come in and come up with a different opinion about what the police officers should have done you don't understand how difficult the job is to police officers have until you walk a few miles and their shoes it is a very difficult job it is a dangerous job\nAnd and and and police officers in my estimation by and large are willing to put their lives on the line to do what is right to protect the community and that is that's that's a rare thing to find people who will do that\nIf I'm a police officer and I now know that every single thing that I Do is going to be scrutinized by political group of people appointed to to do with nothing on their agenda to do but just look at what you've done and how you might have screwed up\nI don't think I Want to be a police officer anymore or at the very least if I'm Out there on patrol it puts a of a grain of doubt in my mind at all times about whether or not I'm doing the right thing and let me just tell you\nIf you're a police officer and you're put in life and death situations\nThe one thing I don't really want you having to do is run the calculation I Wonder how the oversight board is going to look at the actions that I'm about to do people will die if if the if they if if police officers\nFive thirty I'm Ken
