{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Help they're viewed as less competent capable and confident and when men make themselves vulnerable by disclosing weakness of work they're perceived as having lower status being nicer\nGiven the many of us want more nice guys at work we might assume that men would be celebrated for being calm and I'm assuming wrong research has found the men who are more communal and agreeable I for example warm caring supportive and sympathetic\nMay significantly less money than more stereotypically mass killing men more agreeable man across multiple industries made an average of Eighteen percent less income\nAnd were evaluated live less likely to have management potential is compared to less agreeable men\nNow I'm going to tell you something because it's funny I hadn't even seeing this when I'm On the way to work but I I was sitting at a stoplight today\nAnd I passed this guy I was sitting in the subway and he turned and the guy that I Know that lives in our town uh who I don't know very well but I Know him and um he is\nNice guy I'm nothing against it but he is the typical alpha male I mean this guy is a go getter he's an international businessman you know he's just that guy that just takes charge you know\nAnd I'm going that dude has pulled down some jak\nNow\nI Do okay but I'm not that alpha male you know I'm not going to go away and we have a big Gerard I'm just not that guy I\nMean there's not that I don't take care of business but I'm not that yeah I think of these folks that I see 'em sometimes at neighborhood parties and things like this and they just come in and they sort of um they sort of take over you know when they come in and it's not by because they intend to is just their personality\nWell they're normally the people who end up being CEOs of companies and leading things and make it a bunch of money\nBut I Know some women are like this too and they do the same thing they end up making the money and it's it's not a male or female thing like the Harvard Review is trying to make it out to be they're trying to make it out like women are are are bitchy if they're aggressive and that's just not the case\nI'll tell you something as far as management style is concerned and this goes for a man or woman or whatever I don't think it's ever appropriate for a boss to be screaming at people\nAnd I've never responded well to bosses who did but rarely do I ever see like somebody higher up here just screaming at somebody I don't see that\nI mean I I Would be shocked wouldn't you Johnny if if if you hurt somebody down the hall just screaming get some money we just don't see that anymore now you used to see it a long time ago and we would see it from folks who were you know just had a they were hot heads\nBut I thought just as bad as the guy I as I did have a woman doing this you think well the woman's bitchy well the guys in SOB that's what I thought so I mean there's really no difference you can call them whatever you want they were just unpleasant people\nAnd used to be in the day back in the eighties or whatever and nineties you had some of these folks who were just you know they would go off and start screaming it folks\nAnd I think the law suits of probably tamped that down some I think corporate atmosphere of being afraid that somebody's going to sue or whatever but I just I don't see people and and maybe you know maybe I'm In an unusual work situation I don't see higher ups yelling if people anymore\nWhen fact we had a higher up that worked here no longer does but ... he had the greatest style I've ever seen as far as getting\nMore out of people because when he would come around\nIt was never right away jump in on what he was concerned about\nIt was more patch on the back man I'm so glad you're here in uh hey by the way he would he would talk about your strong point right man I Love the way you do this I Love the way you do that if you could do this just a little bit better like pull this up a little bit on make this more and\nThat's the way to get people to do with it is I mean I just thought it was fantastic the wages that but what they're doing with this so called study from Harvard Business review is that they're saying that men get penalize for screening for masculine norms\nAre and the women get a penalize we're straying from their feminine gender stereotypes\nBut I don't you know to me a boss has a boss and maybe I'm just I don't know maybe I'm different that way but I mean I look at somebody if somebody who's in charge that I listen to this person and I'll have a conversation with his first and the same way it doesn't matter whether they're man or woman\nI think there's just the way the ... porch or civil way to conduct yourself or when you're when you're over a bunch of folks and yelling and screaming has never work whether you're a man or woman yeah I don't I mean ... you know they said well the women you say you're shrill no it's it's it's the pitch your voice I Know guys will hire voices and their shrill too\nYou know you either shrill you're booming\nBut neither one is pleasant [noise]\n\nYou'll see when our earnings growing up we are and more\nYou know if you've done costs um squeaking white board marker [noise]\nEasily one of the most annoying office noises there is right up there with the woman who taps or Penn like she's doing a drum solo at a soda arena [noise]\nAt monster we can't stop those types of noises but we can quiet all the noise around finding the right talent you know the noise we're talking about all you're trying to do is fill rules for your company but instead you're being inundated with reps from job sites trying to say you one size fits all products you don't need and your inbox is full of candidates you'd never even consider monster cuts through that noise\nWe work with you to really understand your knees and address those needs with the right solutions no more no less just smart people getting to know your business with simple personalized solutions for a fair price real human being human how's that sound\nWell probably like the opposite of this marker [noise]\nCalled eight eight eight months to to talk to someone without Louis today ...\nHenderson bail Nashville\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and not the presumption of innocence supplies and that some ... substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald John Trump notch you one more victory and his ...\nSo what ah twenty two months in office\nThe Trump search scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero the economy is percolating like crazy Mexico Canadian trade battle has been won by Trump including South Korea next fall will be the goddess havens in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year\nThe last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us\nA lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese and it's going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea and now according harassment and they came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think of a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reaganomics looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pen cushions this guy fights back\nWhen Trump is hit he hits back Carter what he did\nOn a Monday Night last night with the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man and he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful\nIt was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only half stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh\nWas a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals he's\nNot the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further Kavanaugh\nKind of look ... looked over Trump and said that's my motto that's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other wimpy middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in them to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion because But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and the eloquence all of his ah all of his grade school girls' basketball coach in your teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a lawyer Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you fired hook line and sinker\nAnd then the other witness testifies and you say you know what I don't know what to believe now Kavanaugh\nHe he in a sense hypnotic ... took on Trump's personality and he fought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules\nHe knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after Christine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about their claustrophobia and how it changed her life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe Kavanaugh and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses in every whatever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapist notes were critical of this that she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her\nWhen she was in her late teens\nAnd the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not timid Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her she she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh\nSo she flipped and change what she was saying\nIn order to try to take Kevin down and it didn't work and the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office in a direct entry into her house into a room\nSo the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way\nOf course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti traveled do ally travel to Central America to travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delayed brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment in the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer in charge of the Senate and the investigations that would be launched and all the problems that arise\nSo tonight I Want to get your perspective mark Levin is off until Monday he'll be back then it was some well deserved time off the great American built Cunningham is here so I Want to also let you know that a Marshall events dad Jack Levin has a new book out called our police\nOur police which is

there is someone that of course that I cannot watch but I Am told that he has a a writer named aerial do miss who on Saturday Night or Sunday tweeted out whatever happens\nI'm just glad we'd ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nSo this clown this fool in New York aerial do moss working for Steven coal Baron CBS is Late Show is happy that the life\nOf Brett Kavanaugh is now ruined\nHis wife's life Israel and that his daughter's life Israel and the reality guess what area do miss\nBrett Kavanaugh is life is not ruined his name is not ruined his name as associate justice Brett Kavanaugh because he sat today this morning on the United States Supreme court where he's going to be for the next thirty to forty years but that's the mentality that we're fighting with\nPlus I Want to take up the cause and what's happening in Portland, Oregon did you see the reporting out of ... and ... is doing in Portland, Oregon harassing individuals street near sections take it over blocks of the city the drug dealers the drug Easter homeless the radical left or taken over parts of Portland, Oregon\nAnd then the feckless foolish marriage doing nothing to stop it must get your thoughts on Brett

John please go ahead\nAnd show them following this thing pretty entirely from start to where it is now and absolutely I agree with your opening bottle first off factor stubborn things you know and and the words of our of our\nPresident John Adams a you know if you're just dissect it and look strictly at facts and you go off the values of the country that you tell proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling how people can wait to no kidding a conclusion of all if this guy he's guilty\nAnd you know John last night I watched some of the left as media today talking about how how unfair it was\nThat the president declared a innocent a bread Kevin isn't that one of us aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this wasn't the case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of walk a Christina forward down to perform rose path\nWhen she oddly questionnaire about coaching a friend who was taking a federal lie detector tests and now I'm watching Rachel metro said she must know something in what she knew what was that the ex boyfriend or Christina Ford and by the way Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who sold his credit cards but I redress\n... what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend protect going to lie detector test\nOr the under oath through a sworn affidavit a boyfriend and Christine afforded the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governors administer polygraph exam and so practically everything that Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether\nIt's the front door the fear of flying not taking airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christina forward lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for a status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that that that is the only conclusion one could come to heal absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear that no kidding I got a tactic is actually a lot of\nThat that's that's terrified because you're now take somebody with a lesser degree or a lesser income in life or whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just they're all coming back or something like that they're going to be no coming back\nWhether whether you know just the mere fact that it could be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWill join orders Brett Kavanaugh will go to get back his reputation you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape and there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what\nAnd didn't know how it happened and the foreign witnesses she possessed applied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw ... and here still found guilty about and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight on [laughter] that would that would be it wouldn't come back you know but then again I wouldn't get their due process went at it from such a thing\nJohn I I'm a criminal defense attorney\nBeen in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh uh someone stole my Chevrolet\nNot going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a Chevrolet if so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault ten to twenty percent of the time\nThere are false allegations of sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project\nHas listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later who are wrongly convicted of sexual assault Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry to black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges\nThere was a ... university case were for college she meant at ... chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow student it came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples\nHow a woman or man falsely accused as someone of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons\nAll I'm saying is give Brett Kavanaugh of due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look for in the eye which the Senate denied and now that the weak took ... Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nTore apart the story of Christian afford improve that she was either a ... or a lawyer or both\nAnd they could prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even president\nAnd so when this has happened\nIs that going to stop the radical left now from perpetrating lives again spread cab and all of the answer is not just know\nThe answers hell no they're going to continue\nTo tactical long ago this this is what they do that and that's the part that is absolutely mind boggling [noise] you know it's like\n\nWe need all the friends we can find us on Facebook we're taught Ninety nine seven tell you the weather's traffic and top [noise]\n\nI was thinking I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal I hear about the norms and the presidency\nLet's talk about norms of presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was that normal\nHow 'bout the eight years of ah William Jefferson Clinton sexually assaulting Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky than he violate the norms of the presidency\nMoving on to Bush forty three increase taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq the costs four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThat Bush forty three get us into the norms of the presidency is that normal then you had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV is not the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency that John F. Kennedy violate the norms of the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nMale cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them\nWas that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency with water grade in line did he violated how about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the presidency so\nPlease save me the embarrassment I'm trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency\nIs if Obama and Bush and Clinton and Bush and LBJ and\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms of the presidency please save me was continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to um hey thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles of courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley your role that he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nUm strong personality wise to pull any direction they encourage it causes much trouble as a ... and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me have shown as your question talking about the norms you know I'm Liz listening a liberal media today because they think Trump last night\nViolated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do you think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance center I think their behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity\nI think it was terrible\n... and another point in the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November I don't even remember the eight twenty sixteen that he may not get it might not accept the election since the election has Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nAnd aren't haven't met become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse and worse\nBecause they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication that things that Jeanette\nThis country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as I say it's sick\n... about accepting the results of the election whether\nIt's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general named Jeff Sessions who should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general\nHe should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama but what happened is\nThat that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of a ... am known maladies I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nYeah up all this is abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is abnormal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nOr I'm with you and I also did test the fact that they will not acknowledge anything good anything could be as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has does\nDonald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm aren't perfect you know he never did that so he tried he tried hard hard working man for a million that doesn't have to do it right I have ultimate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today\nNot sure we got to run thank you

Ford which is why she has been seeking mental health for all these years\nAnd probably what she told the therapist\nIncentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys tried do rape her in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind she recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens have became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties and became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine Ford\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told a therapist in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold the therapist\nWho rented a room in our house that caused her to put the second front door in our house so patients come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to write me in\nIn my late teens and the Nineteen eighties and then some out in her mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens that while I was Fifteen set of the mid Nineteen eighty ... let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics the Stanford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime Dianne Feinstein office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encouraging require her to come forward\nAnd won the Senate said when the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers were so perfect for um her responses drew out\nI'm feeling some sense to say they were absolutely perfect um to make you on our side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer referred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this woman probably had something happen in her life ... involving those four boys or tried to write a paper\nAnd that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident then damage your life so much she didn't get two master's degrees and a doctorate in damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years\nAt Palo Alto University in Stanford\nAnd and not so bad she isn't written or co authored sixty one books and periodicals what was she would have done Seventy one books in periodicals there's no evidence that affected her life at all\nIn every factual statements she made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one or the other they've all been proven not to occur and Jeanie you're a woman\nAnd of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party do you want to live in a country where your son your brother and your father does not have due process\nAbsolutely not I Am a Christian and I follow what the Bible says I think the man should be the leader of the house um I\nYou know you you can't say that you can't say that you can't say that I\nDid a ...

that there are times ten to twenty percent of the time when men are wrongfully charged with sexual assault and due process ferrets out the good from the bad the right from the wrong and then we from the chaff\nI wasn't Mendez do process rights because that guarantees down the road that wrongful convictions for rape and other crimes which happens hundreds of times every year in this country will be less likely I Want women to be protected and I think men have rights too in a sense the me too movement there's nothing wrong with the me too movement\nAs long as rights and due process goes along with it\nAnd if somebody's charge why there is a title nine violation or rape or sexual assault or a groping I don't want my wife groped or my sister growth that's disgusting and if somebody groups a

impeach Kevin ... of course you can only impeach a federal officer\nFor high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office so he's been in office one day this morning that his first couple of hearings and the Democrats already one to impeach\nAnd they don't want to teach them what they want to do is raise money to use and Heidi Heitkamp stray so North Dakota for example or Joe Donnelly in Indiana and that's what they want to do they are threatening to impeach when they're never going to do that because it wouldn't fly you need fifty one percent of the of the house and two thirds of the Senate it would never happen\nAnd if ... if there's a God and having the Republicans will keep the Senate for weeks Trump tonight will know better that are so that the federal judges the pipeline

the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so the Democratic party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd the party of Jim Crow democratic parties the party of lynchings\nThe Democratic party is the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system it's responsible for most of the criminal disasters as say like in the city of Chicago the Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings collapse of public education in fact\nAbout eight percent of Detroit or Chicago public school students that are African American ... to the appropriate level\nAnd so you're talking about a massive dumbing down of the population to keep them on the modern plantation which is the Democratic party so Sonny ... behavior you're seeing from Democrats has been repeated for the past hundred and fifty or some cold than the demon rats they're not Democrats or the demon rats and what what we see\nAnd the restaurants in the in the airports in the elevators today it's mild compared to what the Democrats did in the Nineteen sixties burning down about a hundred American cities so I wouldn't put a lot past

again\nListen when we hear about the radical left the far left we see what's going on in the schools we see the crime you see on TV for\nThis is the result of liberalism now let me give you some quotes from the communist training manual to communist right use the system to destroy the system the communists right the best way to help the cause of communism is through the liberal wing of the Democratic party\nThe communist right yesterday's left us today center today is left will be tomorrow center that talking about\nThe whole American political system moved to the left so they have a highly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist a tactician\nThere are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers there are a lot of our congressmen and senators so what\nYou see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian probe you see the violence and Ryan ... and all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain there's the also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional ... telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so the organized left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this is foreign influence in our government a foreign agent of red China like Congress when Dianne Feinstein she's the one that started this big hoopla about a ... as a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than than numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nSubpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slug Jerry ... taken over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nCould be terrible I mean\nWe're him and what I mean what legislation would pass what what activities on our behalf whatever occur if Jerry ... Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are in charge of the house of representatives what positive things would ever go on\nNothing that I could think of Iran\nEven if we got a new Mueller out of the picture oh jeez they would\nThey would just keeps the painting and keep investigating investigating and it would be non stop investigations that they went in the house so we\n... I Want to encourage everybody to donate all you can do what you came out and tear volunteer all you can if you can't donate then get they're not doors if you see a sign for you know the the other side the Democrat\nBe as nice as you can pull eyes you can try to ... people why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person\nBecause the reason yeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not to vote for him and just being is not just in about it but engagement tried to get them to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know I Want to be part of the crowd so trying\nTo talk to me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose the Texas Senate seat to a clown like bait or Rourke is that possible\nOr it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because um you know the betas got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know he was young and you know he's\nA you know some people I guess finding physically attractive not eight different strokes for different folks or whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd yeah there there's obviously some liberal natives here you know in the Austin area and some other Houston Dallas a but most of most of Texas has you know pretty normal solidly conservative normal ... yeah\nYeah but ah yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so\nUh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've not we've got to have him where\nSee what's happened in Florida it's too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with him from New York from the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore and moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs going to be hard for the for the governor when the U.S Senate seat but\nYou know Scott ... is pretty good governor but\nNonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida then the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican and can't get elected if in Florida and\nNew York they begin to me it was one and if taxes looks the same electorally as New York then we're done because Texas and Florida would tempting permanently\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or play I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was a pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president\nAnd I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nThis way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning 'cause I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart\nDo what he was going to do but Donald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done\nAnd you had the store factories going to be in Cincinnati on friday I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence of these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles it's Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say doesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president\nI think is an Iowa denied he hopefully will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside\nAnd this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out and there's going to be twenty thousand people show up this guy's ... a conservative politics\nHe's done exactly what Ted Cruz wouldn't have done but crews doesn't add the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm or whatever you want to call it\nBut Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty over for or Whitney Houston circa twenty oh three this guy's a rock star and when he shows up in your town\nIt's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to ride that baby for all it's worth and\nThis guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what miles rope and to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump as a president\nOr not because he's the most godly man but because I Believe that this is the point because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald did know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that confident fake and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis kind of get back to where it needs to be\nImagine of Hillary was in the White House

mayor be charged for aiding and abetting the um those who against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with one state authorities actor honor act on their color if state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy the object of which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals' confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property and\nThen when authorities did not arrest those individuals and this happened in Washington DC this was under color or a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way so is to deny the human rights of Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice under\nJeff Sessions these things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color of state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John is that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine\nLarge numbers of radical individuals taking over as\nIntersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and
