Ecuador is seeking to end his asylum in turn him over to the United states\nIs what he says the WikiLeaks\nFounder who's been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for I don't know how long how long have you been able to a couple of years more\nHe spoke from the embassy via teleconference said the first hearing of a lawsuit that was initiated by his legal team against the Ecuadorian government lawsuit challenges the new rules which require him to pay for medical bills phone calls and clean up\nAfter his pet cat but to see through the cat come on man you're a gift and their embassy you gotta flipping cats are you kidding hey maybe the cats are sending secret messages outside\nDuring the hearing a son and said the new rules were assigned Ecuador was trying to push 'em out and said Ecuadorian President Lyndon Marino had already decided to end is asylum but not yet officially given the order comments prompted the south American countries top government attorney\nAnd they'd go sell the daughter to interrupt him and warn him not to make political statements during the proceedings\nCourt officials told journalists they could not record any of the statements made during the hearing settled the daughter\nDid not directly respond to his son just allegations but he had told reporters last week his sons was welcome to stay in the embassy with new rules you also said the United kingdom in August at assured of songs that he would not be extradited if he left the embassy where he has lip synch twenty twelve\nAnd he took refuge in the embassy after British courts ordered his extradition to sweetened the face questioning at a sexual assault case that case has been dropped though supporters have said that the sun for years and it can be extradited to the United states\nIf he leaves the embassy which what like you know I got her wish he would because that would force his hand on this whole thing about the DNC and where he got the information from and maybe we would've last find out what the truth is he says he did not get\nThese emails from the Russians and I always thought it was kind of strange that\nA couple of days after ... rich was gunned down in Washington DC who nobody ever heard of before ... offers a huge reward leading to the conviction of his killer what would you leave with songs you how do you even know Seth Rich or less ... was the one funneling\nThe emails too and that's been my theory all along course it's interesting Sean Hannity and some others on\nFox News\nWere were beating the drum for a while and just got shut down\nI mean just shut down by Fox News and they buy all these people complaining about voting since when have theories which by the way have a lot of\nNot evidence directly but certainly circumstantial evidence like I said about Julian Assange why would Julian Assange offering a reward for a low level computer\nGuy with a B and C how would even know who's the guy is where the guys gunned down nothing was taken from the D.C police says it was a botched robbery\nBut he still had his watch he still had his cell phone he had a gold chain around his neck he had a wallet with money and credit cards and none of that was touched and he was shot from behind by the way\nIt sounds like an assassination to me somebody wanted him dead\nAnd so why in the world would it be inappropriate to speculate that maybe he had something to do with all this wouldn't Julian Assange is offering a huge reward leading to the conviction of his murder why with Julian Assange do this how what Julian Assange even know who the guy is one of the warden\nLists Seth Rich and had some communication with Julian Bond who was passing information to him and he also said in an interview he didn't specifically say Seth Rich but he says you know people are\nAre are harming people who are giving me information and and the next breath he's talking about offering reward for Julian is a for a Seth Rich from Julian Assange WikiLeaks\nJust sounds like to me there's something going on there that should certainly be pursued you pursue it oh my gosh they shut you down I've never seen anything like in my life I've talked to some folks at Fox News they said they have never been pushed back on an issue like this before and the history of working for Fox News\nOr the Seth Rich family and everybody

honor\nTo have the ambassador to the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on the west has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with um what did you see there are certain\nOil which you know a horrific act or Santa Semitic attacking and us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive\nI'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community and I think of special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight knit\nIt's not just taking it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians a Jewish faith leaders of most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and start and uh and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance without that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday because some days like Monday Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel ... because we are the one and only two states so we feel a\nSpecial sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why we support for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor of Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about that yeah we're the ones with the speech that that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were in Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout your\nUh the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOpening it is going to say a growing problem or many people want to say that it began to two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned a thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population market there\nI mean for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an\nAttack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust\nWhere it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is that it's once again become fashionable or to attack cues and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after just now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America it's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris\nAttacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six at the G federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a at outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claimed three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you got to have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people\nUm you could have a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there is a stream of saying it could be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of\nPeople but online they can actually build communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media\nAs you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's ... dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you mark did in Israel we monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here and I know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them are we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your in laws and constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of\nThis kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the clock ticks place that's what we have in Israel\nUm and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other\nWhen CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organizations really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news the news conferences now at the White House\nYou clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise] month\nBurning your degree from

will you stop texting and driving tell us at ... dot org brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the guys who are\nMad\nMen go out on that\nOn ... radio program\nWe make the news makes sense my putting it in perspective than talking about we're talking Ninety nine seven WGN sweaters traffic and talk [noise]\n\nLarger allowed by law Martin live on a show\nNow at age seven seven three one ... one one one of the key Senate races in this country is in the show me state Missouri [noise]\nAnd uh he's got an excellent Republican Kennedy Josh Hawley versus Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look I with Trump half the time and I post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time you know\nThey're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls is she the little desperate to be honest with you mark and as you should be because ... she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her\nThat they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nAt dinner McCaskill turned her out to vote no on Neil Gorsuch would Supreme Court no one justice Kevin ... know on the tax cuts no on border security no rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be more out of step\nWith his she running a New Yorker Missouri yeah exactly well\nMost of her money comes from New York and California bats she'd be a great senator for one of those places but for this state hardly and that is that's our big problem and that's why she's down to the polls or she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a leftist to be perfectly honest with you and her votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the of the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars that expenditures are from Chuck Schumer he had spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country\nTrying to prop up but Senator McCaskill under by her seat and you know that the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they they don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just doesn't flying\nThe the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh\nIs a big big issue in this race that really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted\nAnd are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race immigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to\nMaster the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and a bad as a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress and the people want somebody is going to be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal but\nYou know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's a pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill's saying you all oppose us a ... methods and protecting people who have pre existing conditions is that your position and she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that much as it's a it's a total and ridiculous fall so she knows that and I've called her out on them many times in our debates\nI support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare to do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them hall hostage to Obamacare in my state\nAnchor healthcare prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that at the national average and things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan but is it Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now is she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to duck and she says she's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that's\nWhere this is headed and we all know that that does she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on edge you any major issue an issue of consequences and\nYou know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare\nImagine what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate a folks who are\nOr who have paid into the system it will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nZip recruiters powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes\nTo find people with the right skills experience

and the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make\nHim responsible for these ridiculous [laughter] accent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction so many people across the country I'm not finished the only person responsible for carrying out either these heinous acts were the individuals who carry them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders\nFault individual who shot up a baseball field of congressional Republicans you can't start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out across Germany\nJohn ... where are you concerned about the uh the rice and that was sent to Susan\nCollins or to the president or to\nThe secretary of defense or the head of the navy or how about the president's children were you concerned about that did you talk about the Democrats and their tone did you go to Maxine Waters did you go to Adam Schiff how about you guys do you ever look in the

Jackson at one point to the media stopped creating scenarios where the president feels he needs to punch back why have you drag Donald Trump into what\nA deranged Jew hating mass murder did you know
