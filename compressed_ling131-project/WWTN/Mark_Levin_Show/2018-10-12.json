appreciate that\nThank you um I had two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was dying in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thought disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and they spoke out about somebody abuses that were going on\nAnd from the hill quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness from depression and then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of the two places\nEven up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on there and you're homeless twice I Lived in my car\nIt's also suicide prevention month and I think by making it sound as though Congress has some kind of mental illness whether he guys left I think it's not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say badly about him the four of them spoke out about Bush [noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't the day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just and just hope you will know that we ... we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health or a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say that says where's the compassion and and I say this first of all thank you for\nYour sharing your story and I'm I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have great compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token\nA black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage of abusing him by putting them out there today no one said any of that when Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was the narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative then you are on the Marco venture been for some reason I go ahead\nBen Jerry's is still in my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of the hit that I'm a check this out so now Russia walkers going to be the next soaking negro because he said at the time limit ...\nUm I think it's horrible what is left these are doing but that's a whole other thing is talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only him I Will first she's the only attorney general to be a\nContempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue with the Obamas gutter we'll you when you know you really going too far in show probably grab by the IRS and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet um\nBut him Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters are Democrat our base that's all they do is they're inciting violence and then they say in the in the means of\n... and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob mentality\nWhen you have people screaming and beating on the doors the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality when you surround a senator or like Ted Cruz at dinner\nA that's a mob mentality when you go in and you can you do these eat it ends in citizens and scream in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here to to seek out and destroy people when we think about the ... district mob mentality you have to have\nTo ... to ... to first of all\nYou have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford they didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway so you say we don't care about you were going to use the canary\nWe're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're going to find people to say well you had sex we had a boat in the eighties well wait we've got to re Kansas or never mind never happened while he he he actually in high

act like it's a legitimate and we'll throw it on the news\nTo try to find out other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is it normal for them and the reason why they're doing this is all I I'll go back to what I said earlier than\nThere is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate\nAnd and to turn people into villains so that you hate them\nThat's their only play you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can't scare people on on healthcare because you you are the ones that created the health care disaster\nYou can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to raise just to be in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible what they really have no platform well\nDon't forget they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and I'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on you know speaking about the mob mentality I challenge any of these people to walk down\nI'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends that are such as you go to parks down there and it's nothing but a ... and they will seek to living heck out of\nYou you will get the antifa protesters this week that were directing traffic and yelling at white people is that none of
