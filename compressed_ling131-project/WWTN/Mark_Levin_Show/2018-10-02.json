doesn't remember how she got their deserve she left\nThose are important details I'd say that\nShe knows she only had one beer and it was not on any medicate\nSo she remembers those details\nOf Dr Ford's account of the alleged assault has not\nBeen corroborated by anyone she herself identified as having attended including her lifelong friend she named three people who attended the party mark

the party but she couldn't remember his name know others have come forward so no driver has come forward\nAnother boy has not come forward\nNone of the people she name could corroborate what she said you know the case of labeling Kaiser her lifelong friends she doesn't even remember meeting Kavanaugh\n\nDoes it get any weaker than this is it can't anymore insane than this\nThree named witnesses have submitted statements that Kim many denying any memory of the party whatsoever no this is interesting to me [noise]\nNow they submitted those statements I assume under penalty of perjury so they'd better hope that their statements that they're giving to the FBI are consistent with what they've told the committee you see the way I Know a a an investigation normally occurs\nIs there's not all the publicity and so forth and so on so witnesses of shaky memories\nAnd so forth and so on\nThey start to clarify quote unquote their thoughts because of the media attention because of the lawyers because part as sins and so forth and so on so it gets harder and harder to get to the truth\nBut it really interesting to compare what they provide it to this committee and what they're saying to the FBI would\nMost relevant lady and her first statement to the committee miss Kaiser her lifelong girlfriends state it through council that quote simply put ms Kaiser does not know Mr Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where he was present with or without Dr Ford\nQuote unquote\nIn a subsequent statement to the immediate sort of counseling this Kaiser said that quote the simple I'm On changeable truth is that she is unable to corroborate Dr Ford's allegations because she has no recollection of the incident in question\n\nMore over Dr Ford testify better

assault writes the prosecutor\nAccording to her letter that Senator Feinstein Dr Ford heard judge Kavanaugh and mark judge talking to other party goes downstairs well she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone so in her letter the Feinstein she heard them talking to others\nIn her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone in her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other persons of the house we're talking with them\nQuote unquote but she testified that doctor that actually with a judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintain that she could not hear their conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNoticed she never said she turned down the music either that any of them turned down the music\n[noise] her account of who was that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post's account of her therapy notes\nThere were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted\nShe told the Washington Post that the notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter to Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEntered testimony she said there were four boys and additionally ling Kaiser and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward Dr Ford listed Patrick PJ ...\nAs a bystander quote unquote in her
