externally the dimensions of the case or the same\nIn the seven six two fifty one that the U.S has three white but the pressure\nIs different because so casing fitness is different right and actually

that you you can't get into too much trouble\nEntered changing no two cartridges in modern firearms if you shoot your three oh wait out of your car you're you're gonna be just find a where the where the problem comes and that is if you have an old military gun\nThat uh is chamber it in seven six two fifty one or you could get into problems from that way is that\nYes yes I'll tell you something that ... and ... and you know using your ... your information there an example of a gun that probably should never be fire with real aid only seven sixty but fifty one would be\nSome Israeli guns okay believe it or not some Israeli guns yeah when Israel was formed after World War two they got tons and tons of surplus old mouser rifles\nAnd they're still out there and they converted them two seven six to ... fifty one seven six to NATO I think they might have more than ... ... there were stamp big litter seven six two big numbers\nAnd though there are some guns out there but I Would say that I I and I I'm guilty of this uh I just fire most all rifles and it's really an amateur\nIf I have a three way that I have to fire or should I if I was seven six to ... and it and so that I can be absolutely sure it can take the extra pressure it's kind of like test load for me now should you do that all the time if you're ... probably not\nThey converted some ... instance route to seven six to ... they use the military bowl AMA\nThey were designed for they're made for it so if it's if you have any doubt in a in a modern ... in a in an earlier than only shoot some six to\n... you know NATO I ... it seemed like we there was some manufacturers and I and I know sick with one that we question directly ... could we shoot three oh wait in their guns and they were like yeah sure go ahead you know it's not not a problem but\nIf I remember correctly when we did research on it before then Israeli guns over those boat on those miles or we're the problem they were the from the ... that that was the only one that everybody's said if you get a hold on one of those you could be in trouble with it they they are out\nFrom um a a brand evidently brownie or a brownie did a sixteen and a and a five and they did it for six days did the sweet sixteen was they lightened gun well anyway he has got to\nThe barrel rings he's calling I'm a ... have homes and um and the other one that he he's only gun doesn't have holes in them\nSo he wonders whether they will work and Judy put them on there and shoot 'em or what's the deal\nWill I Believe that the magazine tubes all those two guns are the same diameter I Believe that\nI Can't swear to that well his different it is how these right well you know in the in the barrel hangar you'll notice on the sweet sixteen there are holes board in it and there was all about lightening the good\nSo if they if they thought a a chances are good the holes are probably only in the bronze rain probably not in the steel ring this wrapped around it\nOr the friction peace so uh no I wouldn't worry about that at all as long as they're the same diameter of fit on the same magazine to everything should work just for anything really holds a light in that light and you'd be amazed where the middle of the drill that gun to lighten it up inside ...\nThey tried to originally I think they might say little Graham matter I think they might have been originally called it a twenty weight\nAnd uh they lightened it to be the same weight as a twenty cage and he also says what is the proper placement of those ... you need to go uh online and see the ... there there you'll see a um\nA picture of that if you can go to ... website and you'll see exactly how to arrange friction ranks there's only two ways it can be done All right so\nUm and it all has to do with the steel ring or the friction peace they call it okay so but there's a ... he was on the inside of the forearm they used to put a piece of paper in there that showed how to set them\nOkay a\nGamble wants to know he's got a Smith in western revolver and he wants to know what's the proper adjustment is on the strains screw\nOkay the strain screws at the front of the grip and its puts stream a or creates a strain or reduce the strain on the main spring and you're not making a case to the fact that no I'm not making sense\nI actually went to school to learn I say I really did I I ah everybody knows you twist on it and trigger gets light right right yeah he was on the trigger gets later well the truth is here's Smith Wesson recommends\nAnd that the truth is that bottom that screws to be bottomed out\nTightened not adjusted to that you can lighten the trigger pull it eight and it has tightened it up if you tightened it up now or just if you wanted to lighten the trigger pool or something you shorten the screw you don't leave a loose grew on your revolver okay All right you know how that I got okay don't leave the screw loose\nOkay so everybody that wants to lighten the trigger pulling the Smith was your you know and I know that people have been doing that for centuries but that's not what Smith and listen to this we get 'em all the time ... trigger feels like a wet noodle yeah you know what I'm going to work that they can fire it is a\nYup yup yup yup yup OK guys got an old Winchester Ninety four thirty thirty he wanted to be a saddle ring ... and I we bought a ...\nOnly thing is this threat it I guess he's gonna glued on there I don't mean that they don't do it no it says the the the the three pitch in that direction say ten thirty two\nBut he don't have a whole no that's what guns Mr for [laughter]\nFor drilling holes in your case as I say no they didn't come with the whole uh and does it just go anywhere or just you got me ... I Know it is a ... pretty specific fought very specific spot now\nAnd I'm telling you know I well I mean I couldn't tell him that much right I'd have to look at one sale it goes about right their book I have no problem yeah by the way you know the saddle ring there you know if you're the reason why that they call that a subtle rings because you literally tied you're done to yourself\nRight jeeze yeah yeah I mean self idol so if your horse through your you still have your wife yeah yeah it's either that or have you had one of those vertical scary bridge the horse would drag you to death you know when he ran away but anyway [noise] All right\nBut he told his saddle ring well now this to I'm not make it but no don't you know we do we ... fun because they're no stupid ... ... but any time and everybody tells us that their brother that allow fixed a gun [laughter]\nWell you know what really happened [laughter] so don't tell us that no more oh I'm sure after what happened yeah a guy broke a stock\nAnd his brother in law said he could do it back ... uh you know how Elmer does it oh real good oh yeah and he ... back and look brand new look really good and daily shy\nAnd came back part now washed the problem here because you do that a piece of it before and uh and stronger everybody knows\nHe's stronger where you go to it\nWhere he blew it uh-huh so why it happened\nA couple of things a lot of old guns\nWill have um oil in the woods and\nIt when they they stand the gun on their butts stuck in the in the in the end green or they absorb and part of the woods is exposed to the metal well if you spray a bunch of WD forty in your guess where it goes\nSo goes right into the ... a little right during the risk then we'll go you'll notice a lot of them are just black cool uh-huh well that's oil and you put that under heat lamp and you'd be amazed at what come bubbling out of there\nBut a lot of times glue just will not stick to that and so some stocks\nYou you've got to try to your best to get the glue that get the oil out and then secondly you almost always have to drill and put in doubt pins of some kind of keep that strong and then you've got to use the right kind of glue because there are plenty of glues out there that will really really well I don't know about it and really glued to the other I don't use it but\nUh um but I've ... I've got a quick you said dad back to all that and make sense\nOr another thing to one more thing for a station it is if he wants to have it repaired we've got to go into that crack their stock and get rid of all little glued to got to pick it out of there it's real it's a real wonderful chore really brother in law\nReally shouldn't have been well they shouldn't have done it yeah so you got to guilty blew out of there are but how do you get that how you get that oil out of there where you bought\nI put it in I put it under heat lamps and literally under heat lamp and then it just literally comes bubbling boiling out of the stock is incredible to see yeah and you know a lot of times if you open a take off the bus late I'm gonna like there's it's oil soaked all the way down to the way\nFrom one end of the other it's incredible it's just like a sponge somebody's ...\nNever hurts yeah but it's hard to make them\nIt's hard to glue okay I'm going I'm well folks ah we're going to be going home now looks like in a will think everybody for joining us on Facebook Live you're on the radio show will be back again next Sunday here on WGN Ninety nine seven audio [noise]\nOr life with Dr Sam ... book [noise]\nI Love Indian is turmeric was one of my favorite spices\nI'm Dr Sanjay Gupta scene and cheap medical correspondent turmeric is a bright yellow spice that you can find that a lot of curry powder and mustard I grew up with it living in an Indian household\nNot only does it taste great I think what it's been studied for years and found to help with the wide range\nOf medical ailments according to the age there are more than Fifteen thousand manuscripts than termer with dozens Morgan published every week\nAnd there's good evidence that trauma can help control meetings um arthritis as well as the decrease the likelihood of a heart attack\nAfter bypass surgery\nI reviewed the medicine\nThey also use turmeric to help treat breathing problems information to teach it may be something that helps prevent certain kinds of cancers either and I want to be clear you can't cure cancer or infertility we're all time is I'm back to sound too good to\nHelping you live a better life\nHenderson bail national\nScooby were taught [laughter] I mean I see I [noise]\nLimo wreck investigation Michael on the mood I'm Evan hanging around my family just ...

story of a refugee lady uh from the poll that went in for a an abortion and died and so this place went for many many years a unregulated ah when they finally decided to go in and the reason\nThey finally went in was because he was giving away um drugs you had a prescription drug thing going on but when they went in and they found um urine on the walls the smell of here and the smell of feces a

Ramirez shaking his junk in her face she must have been thinking of Bill Clinton but basically no one supported her story either\nAnd then one of the silent heroes of this has been the porn lawyer Michael Evan Eddie boy he did a great job for the Republicans he came out with such ridiculous\nAntithetical information that no one believed word of what he said in fact the cast of ... light away from\nA weight from a from a doctor forward and Debbie ... put it on sweat Nick nobody believed\nIn fact here's a quote from Senator Collins on Saturday quote some of the allegations levied against judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important I'm thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor forward\nBut at the allegation that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their weaken state to facilitate gang rape this outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parrot it public statements of others\nThat such an allegation can find its way into the U.S Supreme Court confirmation process\nIs a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness quote unquote so said the Senator Susan Collins and that was a beautiful comment I Love Susan Collins I Love Lindsey Graham\nAnd I think Michael having that he's doing a great job representing the Democratic party he needs to keep doing it\nPlus uh as far as supporting the me too movement and standing with Kevin ... ... I read some way of a expert from the independent women's forum Julie gun like coming up later on but Patrice lay on world 'cause it's been on my show many times\nWrote a column a sudden this morning Sunday Morning about supporting survivors and standing with Kevin ... she said those who promotes the slogan set up a false dichotomy if you believe that survivors of sexual assault it it'd be should be able to tell their stories and find justice I Am with you\nThat you then must believe the allegations of Christine afford therefore you must agree the judge Kavanaugh was lying and you must have poses confirmation she said this is a false choice as a woman I can be sympathetic to victims of sexual abuse\nBut also care about the facts of each specific case if I was a member of a jury\nSitting at a rate matter my sympathy would be what the victim\nHowever I Want to hear the evidence or lack of corroboration and inconsistencies to make sure the correct parties identified\nAnd she goes on to point out the number of times the innocence projects and others\nHave exonerated through late DNA testing rape rape is to have spent thirty seven years in jail including Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry who spent and combine thirty seven years in prison\nOn false rape charges DNA testing showed that the men were not connected with the crime and the victim later after they did thirty seven years in jail admitted that she lied\nOr how about the Hofstra University case in which for Hofstra University men were indicted expelled from Hofstra their lives ruined about a gang rape of an Eighteen year old fellow student and twenty nine\nThe accuser later admitted that her allegation was fabricated the authorities dropped the charges for the damage to these young men and their families were already done plus innocent projects it go to innocent project dot com they have hundreds and hundreds of men exonerated\nOf rape charges when later evidence came out why can't the United States Senate understand that about Ninety percent of the allegations of rape and sexual assault or accurate but ten percent or more are not accurate\nIn other words there are uncorroborated and you need evidence which is a bedrock of American Jurisprudence Misrata goes on to say as a woman as a mother as a sister and a daughter I Believe in justice and fairness and the me too movement\nThese fires are not in competition to treat men fairly all victims deserve justice but justice is not one sided due process in fairness should be upheld for both the accuser and the accused for conservatives and liberals for women and for men\nSo when you look at the allegations of professor crocheting afford they completely fall apart they don't exist there is no cooperation\nAnd so you can't say we support the me too movement\nAnd we also have to say that we believe in bedrock principles of due process and fairness and innocent until proven guilty and those two principles are not in conflict\nExcept in the minds of Cory Booker Kamala Harris and a senator Hirono of Hawaii when asked this morning whether it's right for paid democratic activist to chase down Republicans in restaurants in elevators and airports\nShe could not say that as wrongful activity she couldn't say that in fact they indirectly demand violence against Republicans and show you where we are\nSteven ... of the Late Show has a

brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nTalking about it on the line American ... and ...\nAnd Lindsey Graham to be the key voices the United States Senate\nI didn't think I'd ever see this in my lifetime Susan Collins stood up like a tenfold be given the night she was brilliant going over forty five minutes why she was going to support and then I I tried to listen to Lisa Murkowski who made no sense at all it seems like fly ball tactics\nHave good consequences as long as you make the slime ball tactics they seem to work Lisa Murkowski in Alaska I mean there was no reason she could not have listened to what Susan Collins had to say\n... and maybe she hates Trump's so much you could not stand to put one of his nominees when the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd I'm so proud of ah Brett Kavanaugh was wife his mom and dad his girls and what they had to put up with like he was crucified on the Democratic cross of political correctness in title nine that's what boys go through in college when charged with a girl\nUp some sexual assault the most likely did not happen they get into title nine court\nAnd presumption of innocence cross examination of witness\nConfronting your accusers all that kinda stuff doesn't apply so in the minds of Democrats this was a title nine case in which the allegation was made and therefore you cannot investigate professor Ford once investigated mainly by the conservative media practically everything Ford said fell apart\nIncluding the four eyeball witnesses including her river version of the facts from her twenty twelve and twenty third Jane therapist notes including the front door the fear of flying whatever it was I'm not sure she said anything that was truthful at all nothing\nAnd so Lisa Murkowski is stupid the woman from Alaska stupid Susan Collins took some serious flak from the radical left like my friend Bryan kill me did a Fox and friends\nAnd she stood up and did what was right I don't know if she's going to run for reelection and two years\nBut she ought to but now clowns and fools to come out of the woodwork like Valerie Jarrett spun gossipy famed to run against or in Maine have asked let's continue their calls is go to a Lewis in Chicago Lewis in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Lewis go ahead\nThanks bill I appreciate you taking my call Yes sir I just wanted to comment on the relationship of the Democratic party to the pornography industry if you don't mind sure\nYeah do you know the Democrats claim to care about women but I'm over the years I wanted her largest supporters has been the pornography industry and I'm just wondering if they really cared about women why do they take money from these people who would like women that way\nAbout Michael evidently the porn lawyer and I I think you did a great job I mean he's got to be on Don Lemon put 'em on CNN or MSNBC a lot more times Michael Lebanon that he is such a loud mouth clown in such an embarrassment he defends porn stars and this guy\nHe says he's going to run against the president twenty twenty could we be that lucky for Michael having any run against Trump\nI Hope he does bill but I tell you you know if you look back to the Clinton years they didn't have one criminal prosecution against pornography and open the doors to all this I Believe I Believe it open the doors to all this bad stuff this pilot stuff you see out there\nDuring a porn star to porn industry has given millions of dollars that the Democrats along with the abortion industry so killing babies in sub spaghetti women\nJuly for sexual assault is what the Democratic Party is all about if they if they cared about sexual assault or women\nThan their leader would not be the U.S Congressman Ellison and he would not be the candidate in Minnesota and they're really cared about women and sexual assault Bill Clinton will not serve out his term if they really care and the enabler Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton wouldn't have been the nominee and twenty cents thing\nIf they really cared about sexual assault correct\nCorrect absolutely right and you know but actually are doing a lot of harm to these people because of you know the old affect the boy who cried wolf you know nobody's going to believe women who are are telling the truth\nOr if a woman comes forward with the probably eight or nine times out of ten it is correct\nBut every now and then you have Hofstra every now and then you have the Duke lacrosse team or UBA every now and then you have the Innocence Project that's listed hundreds of men cleared of rape charges from false allegations and so yeah I'm going to believe a woman a Ninety percent of the time\nBut I Want to hear the story I'm sympathetic with professor forward I Want to hear what happened how it happened\nHow did you get to the party how'd you get home from the party Hoover the eyewitnesses tell me again about the second door tell me about the fear of flying all these things\nLewis turn out to be a lie or a misstatement or not true you know the truthful thing that happened is I think in twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen\nWhen she wants to see her therapist she spoke the truth and she said and twenty ... twenty Thirteen before a Kevin always going to be a nominee she told the therapist that she was a attempted rape by four boys in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties\nAnd the reason it didn't fit Kevin ... is because he was one boy and by the mid Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not living in Maryland anymore he moved to Connecticut\nSo she had to tell the fair but that it was Kevin Oh but they but the notes of the therapist clearly indicated it could not have been bred to Kevin you see if you go to a therapist or a doctor and you're seeking help psychiatric help or medical assistance you are incentivized to tell the truth\nNot going to go to a doctor and say my right arm hurts when it's really your left foot\nBecause you want treatment so when Dr Ford went to a therapist in twenty ... twenty Thirteen who made copious notes about what she said out of her own mouth she said and twenty twelve now for boys tried to rape me when I was in my late teens and made Nineteen eighties\nShe had flipped out on Kavanaugh and change the story completely\nDo you a test of what you have just said is true and she said yes or is there anything that you're not telling us that should be in this report no and that was it and she went home or she got on the plane and flew what she said she was afraid of flying\nBut my I was watching this guy he was being interviewed actually all other on Fox News\nAnd they were asked you about this and they said well that is is it unusual for you to just ask two questions he says it's not unusual when we're talking to the victim they said you know you don't want to badger of victim\nAnd and your ... plus as it came out her lawyers have paid for the polygraph test so they're going to do with how you know out in this guy's a contractor so what do you want me to do we want you to do this and so that we can say she passed the polygraph this\nBut basically what he was saying is we don't badger somebody who's a victim well who's to say she was a victim who's to say she wasn't making the whole thing up I mean when you've got these witnesses that can't corroborated see that's why if this were a legitimate polygraph test\nThen it wouldn't have been just two questions it would've been cross examination\nBut there really wasn't any of that there really wasn't a well there was some of that from the Mitchell lady from Maricopa County but it was done very gingerly with kid gloves and all the rest of it\nI Know we've got some information that but if this was not a complete interrogation of somebody who has brought serious accusations against the guy who was nominated for the Supreme Court it should've been her burden of proof and she should have been put under the third degree\nUntil we found that with the truth was so as it is now we'll never know for sure\nBut we can say this from a legal standpoint there was no evidence of Brett Kavanaugh did anything\nWill never know I mean we always ... but we don't know\nWell we know as far as we can know and if you want to err on the side of knowing you gotta saying nothing happened you can say oh I think something happened where you can think oh you want to or I bet something happened you have no evidence that anything that [noise]\nBut that sadly will be a foot notes to his entire Supreme Court tenure QuickTime out one eight hundred you know it's interesting I Wonder if the right\nIs ever going to learn a lesson from this I Hope they don't learn the lesson that all you got to do now is come out and accuse somebody of something and then that's all you need you don't need the proof\nYou just accused folks and ruin their lives I Hope the right doesn't start doing that but I couldn't blame them QuickTime out one eight hundred six one eight so we're back into [noise]\nMandate show them that cause out their own not the full story tomorrow afternoon to other things on super talk they didn't\nAsk any dentist and they will tell you must have us brush our teeth too hard\nOn evenly and not nearly long enough\nAnd that leads to serious health problems so I decided to do something about it\nI'm Simon and other and I intend to quit the modern electric toothbrush to help you have fresh breath pristine teeth and excellence or hygiene\nAs a product designer I care about how your
