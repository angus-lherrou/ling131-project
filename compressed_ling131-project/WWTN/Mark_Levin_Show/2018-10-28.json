want them to be missed adds context or maybe it's just the Generation Z in Maine but how do people burn CDs like\nHow do you get a blank CDs and just put songs on it\nAnd the Internet went crazy like how did that ever where did the blank CDs come from first of all I'm very impressed that she tweeted the like she didn't take it out she put like like how they do is like\nSo that she is a a generation Z or which they were born from the mid nineties to them in two thousand Ninety seven is the the starting point for crow is it what is it is a two thousand five two thousand seven then or an

and men dad as we've we've made CDs and he's been down in the studio\nAnd things like that but then it may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and\nGuaranteed generations ears are not going to understand for ever use correct to one of the first things that I think would be is is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now is television commercials\nMy son watches everything on YouTube right he doesn't know what cable television is it's all YouTube but then we hook up the antenna and we're going to watch Sunday Night Football and it goes to commercial things like what's going on here\nSo we just kept us can reverse for this you know what that's a problem I mean I mean because you're you're absolutely right because in and you know where\nHe has never really had to be a commercial or if he does see a commercial that only Fifteen seconds yes and a half minute cars there is a skipped\nRight once he watches five seconds of it right I'm afraid to when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there going how do you fast forward\nWhen she's by for those but she doesn't pay don't have that here they don't have a WPN and you can skip the commercial I'm like oh my gosh how are they living what is going on\nBut see with us it was just a convenience that's nice let's let's let's DVR something has kept the commercials but with the younger generation it's again\nAnd another thing I don't understand about my son is he'll say I want to watch a movie and you'll run and get his eye pad we have a sixty five inch television in our living I'm not bragging it's huge he doesn't want to watch it he wants to in his lap and his hand on a small little like that so interesting to me and you know what though\nThat it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies and how they're using it versus how you might use\nI'm a bigger I mean I'm a huge TV and I see those eighty five insurance but they have the fries like try when I'm ... now\nIn generation okay they're they're not really watching YouTube anymore\nOr do you do yeah uh how are they getting their entertainment that videos on Instagram Snapchat\nBut you're not going to find out what was your program there are they you know what they he watch all those friends are watching some boxing match on YouTube okay so if it's an event do go to YouTube yes but if it's you know no longer\nThey sharing viral videos and I think we talked about this for like each channel having its own app\nAnd so with my ... my my grand my inlaws have cable so they'd given my son their passwords so he can look at the Disney Channel and stuff like that on his lap\nHe has no interest he doesn't want to bop around from ... to ...

hopping into action Wal Mart is going to be trying to take\nYou away from Amazon dot com is how they're gonna do it they're an offer free to day shipping for millions more items and they do right now right and they say they're expanding it's free shipping offer for purchases thirty five dollars and above\nAnd you don't need to pay a membership speed and take advantage of it that's what Wal Mart can say because they want to remind you that Amazon Prime now costs a hundred and Nineteen dollars a year\nAnd Walmart says we're also making returns a lot simpler you can either print to return levels from your online Wal Mart account or go to the nearest store\nJust pack up the item bring it to the Walmart services desk and they're going to return it for you right there on the spot you don't need to uh put it in the mail anymore they're going to start rolling this out in November\nAnd speaking of Wal Mart or a friend of mine does this and whenever he goes to Walmart when announcement comes on over the loudspeaker he gets into the fetal position he screams\nNo no no it's those voices again since those choices can\nAh I I I walked out when he did that and like I don't even know you I'm Sorry [noise]\nAnd then there's also target they're getting in the battle between November first and December twenty second they say hundreds of thousands of items are now eligible for free today shipping a target dot com alright\nSo Wal Mart says we're going to give you free to day shipping targets as we can give you a free to day shipping on select items\nA target also has a few caviar she after you use your target credit card and it's only on orders over thirty five bucks case so everybody's saying wait maybe this is something we can do to compete against Amazon Prime targets as we have another idea they have the drive up surface [noise] okay shoppers in place through orders on line\nAnd then you have to drive to target and then a target greeter is going to put your online order into your car and it's going to be available\nTo thousands stores I never understood why that is even an option white somebody a target thought that would be a great marketing idea when whatever you're gonna buy a target is still to drive to target and then you have to find somebody to actually go get shorter and put it in the car\nVersus just go into prime now that Amazon dot com and having it delivered that day it\nSeems to be able to grocery stores a local grocery store chain here in Phoenix, Arizona allows you to buy your groceries and go pick 'em up who we are today

well why would I buy all this on line I can just go to get my car and go to the store and like well Christie and you don't have to go to the store you know you're just going to come to you and she wasn't you know she went to whole foods she said she likes to go to whole foods but speaking of target you know what we've been talking about my because Mike\nAsked election and Mary and things like

do appreciate your support hey they weren't entitlements\nTo word that we talk about a lot here on the show to part of our conversation tonight because you know this we have a generation of students growing up believing that life is all about me people are so self centered and feel more entitled I Believe than ever before it is an issue that\nWill seems to span just about all ages but especially is true of our kids the underlined culprits again social media were in social media lot tonight because our our kids are immersed in to the world of social media social media and self obsession\nTruly do go hand in hand millennials are obsessed with their image you probably have watched as as your students your Generation Z student if you've got a ... on college has stopped everything they're doing just to capture that perfect angle for that perfect selfie\nDigital innovation has completely changed the way just about all of us take pictures\nBut especially students sadly this change even includes how many teenagers smile for a picture how they perceive themselves how concerned they are about how others perceived them a friend of mine's daughter recently explained to me that everyone wants to be\nIn the one hundred like clubs have you heard of the one hundred like club you probably know what I'm Talking about but I say she was referring to this relentless self gratifying pursuit to attain a minimum of one hundred likes every time she makes a post specifically an Instagram post today's teens are\nJust about his selfie Sadie is reality TV stars and here's here's what's extremely alarming today selfies listen to this today sell these aren't merely a snapshot of how our students are living\nThere obsession with getting the perfect selfie in many ways is changing\nHow they live did you did you hear this the the way that our kids are are grabbing selfies this day listen this is this isn't just about a perfect obsession or you know just ... it's not just about a perfect picture in many ways it truly is it's dictating how our kids are living this entire one issue of course\nIt was much deeper in a social media and I have to admit as a parent\nI think have contributed to it all and I'm I'm I'm sure have contributed to it all you probably have to I spoke last weekend at a a teen event and I asked this silly question how many we have a smartphone I got that look like you're you're kidding me of course we have smartphones\nPrice tag on these babies you know this it's suburbs the eight hundred dollars now well I got that looked like Jeffrey of course we all have smartphones then I asked this question\nHow many of you pay for your own cell phone each month\nThe looks on everyone's faces changed parents you know we we talk about dating we talk about chores we talk about homework we talk about eating your veggies and floss your teeth but but do we ever talk about entitlement I mean do we ever really\nTackled this with our kids I mean we we wonder why the service at fast food restaurants that America has plummeted\nWe wonder why it seems you you can't get help it big department stores or\nCollege grads are entering the workforce expecting\nBig salaries and corner offices and company cars and extended vacation time and\nYou know we we we we wonder about is\nYou know it's because we give trophy to every kid who plays little league now we we ... we buy our kids the biggest in the bathroom and when they lose a thousand dollar phone rather than telling them to get a job and save and buy cheaper one next time what do we do does we run out and we go get him another one many dumped a better one I've been guilty of most of this is a pat\nI'm holding the mirror in front of my face with a lot of this stuff tonight because I Know these practices\nAnd step but across my face I'm ... I'm guilty but I'm learning from a guilt and learning to me that we as parents need to own up to this stuff first of all because it's it's it's a scary way that we are raising this generation\nWe lavish our kids with the latest American Eagle look new or almost new cars on the sixteenth birthdays and Netflix accounts and um action movie pass subscriptions and then we wonder why are kids think it's no big deal to drop Fifteen hundred for a limo and nice meal\nAddressing a touch rental and prom night parents\nWe are doing our kids\nAny favors when we cultivate missing tidal meant mentality at home where we're just not I know this is a popular night\nBut it's three out of this what's feeding the scary it's definitely what Steven feeding the entitlement a difficult boss a job with no ... an apartment with thin walls are kids around for a wakeup call\nThis coming really soon post graduation future realities are right around the corner and many gyms these students are ill equipped for the dose of reality that has a waiting\nYou know recent studies show that this entitled generation is experiencing\nOn precedent that rates of anxiety\nOr depression of loneliness and isolation\nSo so let me give you some suggestions to help counter culture the it's all about me epidemic the first does is make it to take it let me say that again make it\nOr but if you don't change your mind you won't change anything you can change everything but your mind and still be unsuccessful\nYou can change your hair you can change your clothes you can change your your job you can even change your spouse you can change your house you can change your address you can change everything in your life but if you don't change your mind\nNothing else is going to change because the old you will creep right back in to the new change that you made unless you change your mind first so that's a that's exciting Mitch it's really exciting you go into a wedding for your son to celebrate and you know you're not into you know you're in control of the food and the food is in control of you in that are freeing feeling\nFor you [noise] ah\nI didn't really realize how much do they add up I'm Alive bought that our program now [noise] that probably before I don't eat out all the errors but that did and a lot of Tom Ridge award for\nAn adult\nLet me talk to about that because that's a great point he said he's not as hungry before and he was taken out all the time and still becoming hungry\nYou see there's a couple of things I Want to talk to you about the science real quick what he just said\nUh the first thing is that if you will get your metabolism ramped up if you will understand what you're twenty four hour calorie expenditure is your body only needs a certain amount but as we age we know that we don't need as many calories as we did when we were younger but we need as much or more nutrition coach because again\nThe things that are starting to break down in our body if we don't see them with through nutrition then we're going to compromise our immune system functionality and we're going to compromise the chemical reactions that are in our body to good strong chemical reactions\nAnd also to when you're eating properly when your body is being fed writes you don't get is hungry unfortunately when you overeat and when you put things in your body that's not gonna give you good nutrition\nMany times it will cause you to crave food even more many times it will go run through like for instance if you are addicted to uh uh I guess ... coach the whole world is pretty much addicted to refined sugars refined grains\nBut let's say that you have some out of control food cravings with a refined sugars are which so many people do and they just can't seem to break free well interestingly enough those sugars create a ... a Doberman ... reward pathway response that's just as powerful as cocaine and morphine\nAnd so that's why people say they just can't get away they're hooked on it and they are doing it because the food manufacturers know that they put certain food groups in your diet is going to cause you to create the more\nAnd so that's why I guess the potato chip commercial that came out a few years ago coach I bet you just can't eat one well there's a reason why they bet you can't eat one\nBecause again they know that you're going to crave him to a point where you have to have an mentally until you go get that food group but the great news about getting sick or healthy at a cellular level is that you don't have those out of control food cravings anymore and they get their their curved and then once you learn how to really put this in a process\nAnd a paint by numbers system guess what happens then you control those chemical reactions naturally in your body with the nutrition that you're eating\nAnd you don't get hungry as much and you stay hydrated better and you're going to have more energy and sustainable and debt that keeps you and that makes you free from all these food addictions and again we've got coaches standing by right now if you're if you're suffering from out of control food cravings and you're", "show_name": "Mark
