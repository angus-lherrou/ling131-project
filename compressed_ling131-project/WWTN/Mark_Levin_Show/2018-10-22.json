I mean if a dummy like me could figure out but I'm a center and I need to be said for my sins right George you liked that Jordan\nAnd he liked it usually like it up as soon as I Am a dummy [laughter] blues and then I'm going to be one of the use of them nothing [laughter] just don't call me that [laughter] but I don't know that person and the reason I like the versus if we're talking about this church today\n[noise] we're like are\nReally seeking after God the Greek word there's a the ... in our our our church learned that word today and when you look at the indebtedness of that words it ... it it means to really go after to meditate to take time to cry\nThey have the kingdom of God in his righteousness and you've got to ask that question are we as men truly seeking are we taking the time to get after ... guide to pursue him\nTo receive the blessing that he has forced and so we think that we go to church on Sunday and we think that seeking in one sense it is but is that truly seeking or you might do a devotion each morning like is that good enough in the seeking here's the challenge jets\nHere's the challenge well look at Matthew salmon and you look at those all star Christians who are saying lord lord\nWe prophesied we cast out demons we did money works and your name\nThey didn't make it when you look at the rich young\nMan in Matthew Nineteen the guy that\nJesus laid out all the commandments ... I did all of those ... famous they'd go sell all of your possessions in any could do it when you look at that man and you look at that group and Matthew seven these are all people who'd be leaders in her church\nAt the end of the day they didn't know Jesus at a intimate level they weren't in the tail they were about the things of Jesus but it's not good enough to be about the things of Jesus the relationship oh\nThis is a thing of Jesus would you can that's just more religion and Jesus was about relationship relationship with you\nIt's all about it all comes down to the relationship and Jesus lifted that group and Matthew Seventy says hey I don't know you I Know you've done all those good things but and then the day I don't\nNeed the Greek word ... does go [noise] it's a ... in the Hebrew it means incredible intimacy and so\nWe as men you know we're talking about being men you can't be manned outside of genetics go outside of having an intimate relationship with God you can't beat that person\nOr you can't be they're outside of is that ... after seeking got every day we have to wake up in enter into this thing of the ... of pursuing God\nAnd he says if you ... if you know he says I'm waiting to be wanted him when you show up\nI Will bless you uses all these things will be given to you in the previous versus like yeah I'll give you ... have you be food drink and clothing but it goes way way deeper than that and you know this gives you a completeness ... remember that\nTold us to lay offs and that's part on Larry King Greek now I mean I'm ... I'm going Hebrew I don't either [laughter] Jordan you know what I'm saying you get on the show you start you know you really start learning I'm not a dumb anymore\nYou speaking great telling us and tell us purpose yes that's right you know those screams tell us your ice creams tell us all of them together is telling us completeness completeness if I'm usually so when\nYou look at that ... first came about in his righteous and all these things would be given to each it's really if you look at all did their forces pushing up to this idea of hey don't be anxious ah don't be anxious don't be stressed out over life and he's saying the answer\nReally understood that there's so much at stake and there's a true enemy out there and we noticed by John tend to and we're talking about tonight the abundant life ... says there's an enemy there that comes to steal\nKill and destroy what Steve was talking about and what his church was talking about this morning is you have to arm up because if you don't arm up you're going to lose ... eventually Satan is going to get in and you'll be like how I ended up here how does the man ended up in a place where he's having an affair on his wife\n[noise] how's the man in the end it gets to a place where he's looking at child pornography ... rape and a girl or you know or even just looking at porn how do we end up here is that journey it's a bunch of small decisions\nThat we failed on and this insight and will come in and manipulate in Shay me to a place where\nEventually it brings you to a place of death if not in this life if your heart stopped beating your marriage that the heart of your marriage will stop beating the heart of the relationship with your children will start be stopped beaten and eventually it will go after your physical heart and you'll die\nAnd so it's real and if in man if we just realized that and then we would do it Steve\nWe do it Steve a so yeah what Steve said and uh in in an arm up in so you know there's that list of all those things in a fusion six you know the belt of truth to briefly righteous is now in the south Beijing the the word of God which is the sort of spirit you know or that your feet fitted with a gospel\nMan so think about it every day you are to the ... you are to seek\nIndependent on all those things and then enter into this world in\nBattle I Love that above all else ... for this is a life spring that flows from it I mean before anything we do if he was four twenty four I Know ... when he was three for twenty three I figure this out ... check that out I think is wrong I think I'm right project ... will be three okay\nBut you're right maybe you got a Bible [laughter]\nBut it's interesting right above all else when you get up in the ... don't wait until they got at five o'clock pm yeah like right Denise and above all us if we do anything right now\nGuard your heart yeah ... yeah that's the life ... life is live in Los ... you are correct good judge right for twenty three yeah can you most ... most of the ... you get to appoint say over time I was right and you are right judge oh God what if I'm wrong and who's right judge\nJudy and my wife [laughter] to a guy that you found a friend [laughter] I write\nVerse won what I say ... oh man\nRight merge though yeah man gosh but you're on this on their wife [laughter] life flows from your heart but if you are not in the ... if you're not seeking after guide Satan is seeking he says he rooms around like aligned looking to devour the week\nWho are the week it's the people who are not in the ... who are not after the sink you seeking after the kingdom of God in his righteousness those are the week\nAnd he will take a good heart\nYou'll painted with bad stuff in heart ... heart and it's possible it's with the whole book of ... I think is about is protecting your heart I just I just you know when I think about Christ I think what are we lived his life and how he's wanting us to live\nI don't think he gives us the ... the spirit of depression and anxiety\nDo you think he wants his hiding under a table in the morning when I I Can't get out the front door ... where where does he does he say stay and hide he's always saying\nYeah go yeah you know I Love that yeah I like\nTo say I get excited when I talked about this today man Moses in exit is thirty three he's a the Israelites of messed up there in a tough place

satisfied with where we are at me and maybe you're in a good place maybe ... favor with got maybe he knows your name maybe he's blessed you but we need to become like most just say I'm not satisfied God doesn't want you to be satisfied he wants you to ask for the more\nWas that access it exist thirty three exist thirty three and so God shows is shows him his glory and judge here's the deal that when we'd be hold the glory of\nGod we bring glory to God and so our mission statement in our churches brings already gotten to making disciples when we say it all the time but maybe we got the cart before the horrors\nYou've got to hold his glory you gotta witnesses ... see his majesty because when you see is value for who he is you'll see the value for who you are and then you go out and bring him glory and at the end of the day we bring him glory or we don't reason we don't because we have it be held his glory\nWow and that's just fired me up that was awesome God give us more man see why isn't here come on and made up from a mistake [laughter] the credit for twenty four\nAnd you've got some carryover Wi Fi they're showing the glory that's ripe show me the glory I Love it you know

here's my soul\nHe wakes up every day goes here's my soul unless you take it and do something with that have nothing in the ask the lord to take his so every day in to deal with what he needs to go complicates when he needs to accomplish in even in his failures\nGod looked at him and said man this is a man after my own heart let's be that kind of means\nShe's showing no time was taking the night

they'd better like\nHenderson bail Nashville\nThey're they're getting help from sympathetic Mexicans at every turn to offer them food and water clothing transportation\nDriving pickup trucks and vans and cargo truck stop to let them clamor board to go north and so over the next several weeks we're going to have tens of thousands of individuals from the most violent place\nOn Mother Earth make their way into Texas Nevada Arizona and basically\nThe media is telling us we should encourage it and not let and let it occur\nLike Nancy Pelosi said Saturday that she would welcome all the migrants from Central America all of them well there's about thirty five million who live in Central America there's about a hundred and forty million in Mexico there's another two hundred million in South America polling has indicated given a choice\nSouth American Central Americans and Mexicans something like two hundred million would come to America to hundred million\nWould that do to our government to our welfare spending ... hospitals do our presidents we wouldn't have a country anymore to hundred million when it come here\nAnd because the way the law is constituted that are the Democrats were not allowed to change it takes ten Democrats and the Senate to do anything and they won't permit it they won't permit that because if you're from other than Mexico to him the other words from Central America and\nYou may go to America there's a magic car that you have to read seeking refugee status\nAnd that begins a legal process it will take years in the meantime you're inside of America waiting for a hearing that cannot take place we are not scaled they have enough camps they have enough judicial officers do you have enough lawyers are not scaled for any of this to allow tens of thousands or millions to arrive at our border\nSo far this year until October first which is right about two and a half weeks ago we have a hundred and Seventy five thousand\nMigrants have come to America this year from a central and South America hundred and Seventy five thousand we don't have the judges the lawyers the court rooms to hold hearings hundred and seven hundred Seventy five thousand when you have five to ten year backlogs of millions who adopted her jet\nAnd so the game being played by the Democrats is extremely serious if you're from Mexico here illegally you mean taken right back immediately\nIf you're from Central America you have the right to hear that goes on and on and on and never stops\nSo ah I I'm interested to see\nWhen and if the media will change\nTheir coverage to provide objective information the damages caused by unbridled massive illegal migration from third world poverty driven criminals societies into America and what the impact that has in schools orphanages hospitals and the rest\nThere's no media coverage of what's happening in Nevada Arizona California\nTexas New Mexico through legal migration that there is no coverage it doesn't exist the murders of rapes et cetera it does not exist remember that nine of the ten most violent countries in the world or south of the U.S border\nSixteen of the ... most violent the other foreign Africa and they're invading our country they don't have uniforms on but they're coming here in mass incentivized by our media by the Democratic party\nI said in twenty sixteen the reason Trump shocked the world was because of illegal immigration\nFederal judges and the economy right now with Trump is our leader everything is coming up roses it's unbelievable\nTrump has everyone from North Korea to Russia believing we're about to bust up every new treaty necessary to keep to get America back on to even track the trade imbalances are starting to flip he has an economy exceeding five percent GDP\nThe unemployment numbers so not just the ... the lowest they ever could be the or the other three point seven percent of us would not work if you put a gun to their head\nThe terrorists are on the run ISIS is destroyed\nIran has on notice in marginalized and even the Saudis now are doing some soul searching about how they treat people\nOpioid issues prison reform\nMarijuana reform is all coming on the rise this guy is performing magnificently but the media is going to use they think immigration the tank\nThe twenty eight teams to favor the Democrats and the tank this president and twenty twenty now that's not the world that I live in maybe if you live in Connecticut a Las Vegas or Chicago\nOr California San Diego that's the world you live and you want more individuals here was a third grade education Eighteen to twenty eight years old with no marketable skills not able to speak at the English you want maybe a few thousand more in your community\nPlease bring them according to the Democratic party but that's not the word I live in Cincinnati, Ohio I don't think those who think about these issues in Las Vegas or Chicago or California San Diego Tampa Denver Cincinnati I don't think we think about these issues in ways\nThat the mainstream media can understand I must live in some alternative universe because according to CNN this is the issue of unbridled migrants walking into America\nThat will cause average Americans living in Wisconsin and Michigan the vote for the Democratic party if that's the case I live in some alternative universe that's not the world in which I live\nI'm Sorry and I wish there was some way\nThrough the magic wand that we go to help the two or three hundred million Mexicans Central Americans and south Americans not living a great life that don't have the opportunities that you and I have\nWe're only four percent of the world's population but every year legally through press says he's we take in legally one point one million\nForeigners to come into America takes the oath of office and become American citizens which is more than the rest of the world put together we already do that one point one million but I'll be damned if I'm going to sit here\nAnd watch hordes\nOf young males from El Salvador Guatemala and Nicaragua Mexico Venezuela Colombia Peru Bolivia Paraguay why Europe why Brazil and Argentina it simply\nIllegally make their way somehow into America claim their quota refugee get in line for hearings five to ten years from now\nThat will never happen this is fundamentally changed our country that is far\nAnd it's going to be much worse if in twenty Eighteen one and two weeks two weeks in two days the Democrats take the house and or the Senate\nIf that out if that happens the country we live and will cease to exist\nDo we have the have the wherewithal to take in a hundred million people are the schools coined in such a fashion other hospitals ready to go or other bridges the roads the expressway ready to accept a hundred million more people because the Democratic party says that's what's coming how\nIs this possible that the most violent places on earth is sending has largely young males to come into America\nI got a Kevin Jackson coming up later and African American leader of great note there is no race or group of people more hurt by legal immigration than African American males especially young African American males\nThey figured out that this is not benefit them at all doesn't benefit American business does it benefit American public education doesn't benefit the hospital systems that we have this benefit any part of our does it benefit our jobs economy absolutely not we bring in legally one point one million\nYou know I'm proud to say that we are a nation of immigrants but there are legal immigrants you don't determine for yourself to join the country come in and walk into a country which you don't belong to a not a citizen of men demand right are you kidding me\nOh I asked you that question tonight is that the issue that's going to cause millions of Americans in two weeks in two days to vote for Democrats do you believe that\nOne eight six six six or seven seven
