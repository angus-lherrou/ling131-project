{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Let's hear some Trump Shelley from this is cut one they're Luther this is the president asked each member of his cabinet to cut their budgets by five percent now this is unprecedented I think you don't hear this he says that when he took office\nThat the U.S military was depleted and he had to increase its budget to modernize modernize but he's saying now it is time to cut every department by ... percent\nMissiles rockets everything our nuclear is being brought to the level that nobody else can even imagine\nPraise God we don't have to use it they'll be nothing like what we have and there is nothing like what we are and that's why I did that I made deals with the devil in order to get that done\nDeals with the devil then that would be the Democrats for same thing he repeats them so maybe they says immigration remains a top priority for him and his administration says current uh laws are terrible and his goal to fix them\nAnd see what's happening with the border where people are coming up in caravans a we have to stop them even though the laws of terrible it was a terrible our laws are terrible there laughing stock all over the world\nAnd we're supposed to stop people with laws that are very well with doing better than anybody else could possibly even think of it and\nGo and then with trade negotiations with China a fugitive taken a brief falls is going to do commerce secretary Wilbur Ross Trump told reporters during a cabinet meeting today efforts continue to work out a good trade deal between the U.S and China\nIs hard for them to do a deal because they've had it so good for so long it's very hard thing for them to do but we have a very good relationship with China we have I have a great relationship with President Xi and I think you'll see something happened is going to be good for both ... and then he said this about\nOur country has rebuilt China with their hard work ingenious also [noise] but how our country is allowed itself to lose five hundred billion dollars a year and much more than that is ridiculous\nIt is ridiculous and that's where we are so we're redoing all of these things\nAnd that's something that doesn't get a lot of press because everybody talks about you know I listen sometimes you ever listen to market watcher on NPR or market place or whatever it is and it's supposed to be about you know the markets and all that but it's always about how Trump is just ruining everything with these trade tariffs and he's going to get a free\nOr am I don't know about oh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd I'm going well we're downside senior so they always have these folks they cherry pick these folks out of wherever and they say yes this is going to tell us all they'll get and it's not coming to fruition none of this stuff is happening to these things happening\nWhat we're doing is we're bringing shame man\nAnd these other trade partners to the table and were renegotiating the deal is one of the time one of the time they're being renegotiated and they're being renegotiated so that they're more favorable to us as they should have been to start with\nWe look at this from is from the standpoint of all terrorists are horrible I don't want to see tariffs\nTariffs certainly can have an adverse effect on the American consumers if we're the ones paying it\nBut I don't know necessarily that we're going to be the ones paying it hey what it's designed to get these other trade partners to lower their terrorists on things that they're they're doing to us now that doesn't affect you and me as consumers because we're not in business but if you're in business and you're trying to sell I don't know\nJack Daniels or something like that in ... now and they put a big tariffs on the thing when it comes over there you go well why is that fair\nAnd and then you know what they do is they tried to rip you off whether its intellectual property or whatever they tried to replicate stuff you remember when they broke into ...\nThe north Koreans in the north Koreans broke into Sony and of course they share that with the Chinese I've always thought that that there was no way that the north Koreans themselves have the technology I always thought that they either gotten to technology or were helped by the Chinese\nOr what happened was you know what we got from it we're all the salacious emails about everybody inside and that's where the press picked up on but the big stuff was they stole intellectual property movies and things like this and then they distributed in China North Korea they rip them off\nTrump's trying to stop that and highly would have to go begging [noise]\nAll you do it yourself or you can get really hot\nLike jak putting his new ceiling fan together for the past four hours in front of that is Cody feeling the shock of a hundred and twenty votes through his arm thinking that power was off it's still\nNot

N. dot com\nYears in vale Nashville\nStudio where I mean I [noise]\nFinal word Russia probe revelation print out a coup d'etat senators remain United as they continue to press for action against Saudi Arabia in connection with the disappearance of the Washington Post journalist\nTo issue is the possible murder and just never been to us ... Saudi conflict in Turkey something happened\nTo one that I don't think he fell through a hole in the fabric of the universe I think um I think he was murdered and Republican John Kennedy says the Saudis have a lot of explaining to do I think salt the Saudis are acting not certainly acting like they did it Democrat Chris ... says one thing the Senate could do in response is to impose sanctions against Saudi Arabia\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow\nWe did it that were responsible that Trump's somehow with ah with um Mohammed bin Salman so called an M. B. S. than MPs to somehow consulting with Trump to decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap nobody's in very\nThis we have a western mine a Judeo Christian ethic we believe and due process at least Republicans do so we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nButter Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nKicked in we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that the answer of course is no\nThis is the ah the event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez\nOr a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months of the Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event how can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all\nAnd somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen how is that possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs is on speed dial what's pushing her and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and\nThat Brock Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia\nIs the pitch enemy of Iran maybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weak in Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not being enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThey're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together and lots of areas\nSo that may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis but whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars a of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen\nIt occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis countries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gig and stupidly they decided to pick\nA consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed\nAnd if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere\nTo the Turks are the sides you\nKnow what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things are heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and or Montana the president is going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that a lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media say wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about ... who was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America\nPaying their passage the MS Thirteen with the girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now\nAnd so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his Rasmussen\nApproval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction if we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's gonna happen in the house I have no idea\nSo so let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does eight\nSeven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three

great when mark Neumann way of case in prison Josh and many others to lines are open\nTo the ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one Leslie before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on\nThat uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system as I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine present never get you a Supreme Court and so if\nAnd twenty days the Senate flips to the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point if Trump was reelected which most of us believe he will\nAnd at the center stage democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one and it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop they will not nominate nominate but they will not confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system\nAnd whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental certainly all the investigations if the house of becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely investigations of every aspect of Trump's live his wife's life\nJared Kushner's live everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years or not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving the mob power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect of course his foreign policy right now despite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with Assad's things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by\nThe Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria foreign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international expertise the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history how were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it will\nIssue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office so if you went to the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about er and only about investigations and impeachment and hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot so when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on if that happens\nDo they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse had comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are is incentivized says they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivized interview incentivize the mob by buying them all for\nPaying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now we have a case in Los Angeles than Chris in Atlanta line becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more Keith in Los Angeles

know if that's the deep state but the lead that they had conversations with authority plans and his entourage around a range of getting up this guy though and if you look and regulate I'm John Brennan\nThe laugh test today and they said he confirmed that the CIA\nOperative so I think um yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue on the bottom point\nOut on on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS\nWhy why do you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim

murder of cage Stanley or the murder of police officers unsolved with the same level of interest that they care about a Saudi citizen murdered seemingly by the Saudi Government and in a a consulate\nIn Turkey ... what is it about this event which suddenly the entire media isn't melt down as it possibly trying to tie Trump to the murder\nIs that what you had a we had a caller earlier today that al Jazeera now there is a reliable news source says the U.S intelligence agencies knew about the the killing to take place at a time and didn't stop it and not a nice thing to say I hope we didn't know about it\nI Hope that we knew nothing and that or if he was decapitated her put an asset or tortured for seven minutes that's off what's bad those responsible should be held to account by

that killed her got offered basically nothing the CNN cover that story to the extent that a murder goes by without punishment\nHow many hundreds of American citizens are murdered every year by legal

A. G. A. had had hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without a going on\nIn the store for a week and I think you brought up a good point\nWho do you think the left is wanting the site and click or a journalist that one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are mad about that don't like police officers but they're gonna be much quicker to rush to the case of of one of their own who works at the Washington Post rather than a sort of our of our um police officers\nIsn't that a parent I mean ... why do we spend I mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it\nI imagine it right now it's a bigger story on CNN and MSNBC holidays is about Chris choking 'cause showed ... what did Jared Kushner knew who knew NBS better was it ... or was it\n... or was that Trump did sod spend money and wanted Trump property so at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about is the murder of re most in lieu and what that said\nBrock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter whoever cater to murder of police officers and one B. L. M. got what they want and what are we went dead cops when he won them now and re most in lieu were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered and a barge down Kentucky ambush Kelly we don't know who did it\nAnd at this point what is in the media spent time instead of a show geek in Turkey take up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform\nAnd spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered re most so Lewis killed according to this black nationalist he said that he wanted to come and kill police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown\nAnd Eric Garner and so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not do Michael Brown tried to kill\nA police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt by Obama's Justice Department then Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there was a sick mine in Baltimore who thought police officers ... fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown\nWho was an unarmed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson\nAnd grab his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven but the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist now how down ...

get too deep into there's no money is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about millennials trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live\nAnd she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special but uh and the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty and it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed is not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just such on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and in South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we called the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal with a\nWith everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end we were unable to make it I said we're going to ... coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and uh we have now or just that\nFound much a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so we're\nProbably one of my jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we're talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products are there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states so the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible and yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they said millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair or we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing Eucharist because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not only call me back but are going to give you one more chance and it has said that's okay I'm going to actually cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately after the planning and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with him

and\nThen when he did that the media especially Brian seltzer and tapper and others and CNN went crazy melt down over the horse face common awful it was and this wasn't about a woman there so it was about women in general see what CNN artfully does is take the comments about one person\nAnd generically apply to everyone in the group because they believe in group rights group identity so in this case horse face ... describes Stormy Daniels according to president and the media had a virtual meltdown for a day day and a half on ah\nThe president using the term horse race you described Stormy Daniels that it came out a couple of days ago the TI the rapper is doing an awful video [noise]\nWhich I ... a ... a Trump is a stripper in the oval office\nAnd I saw about three seconds of it that was it for me and I'm not going to watch it\nHowever CNN spent little or no time on the issue that now important rappers or using millennia Trump in a strip her outfit engage in sexual acts in the oval office as if she was working for Bill Clinton\nSo I'm waiting now for the first ladies are ... are still alive like Roslyn quarter or Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama or Laura Bush the former

by the president but when our first lady is depicted as a stripper engage in sexual acts in the oval office\nThat somehow that is not worthy of being covered and that's the other first ladies stood on envelop her in fact have you seen any efforts by Laura Bush\nHillary Clinton where Michelle Obama to spend time and to make more legitimate interview with the mainstream media shoes legitimate with me my audience Trump who is by far the most brilliant first lady we've ever had she speaks five or six languages she's wonderful\nBut the media will not allow her to be the president's wife\nWithout sexual I sing her calling Aaron ignoramus doesn't speak correctly doesn't speak the English well enough for Stephen Colbert there who makes fun of her on\nA constant basis so if we're looking at a fair country with fair media you know media calling balls and strikes you would have criticisms against those in Hollywood and the entertainment industry\nWho wants to sexual lies and make the legitimate and minimize or first lady throughout the world and you would have the other first ladies the other floaters is coming together to say stop it don't do it can you imagine just think for a moment\nIf some country star\nFour or five years ago sexual lodged\nMichelle Obama and put her in sexy outfits performing sex acts in the oval office but shallow bomber\nWhat do you think the view Kobe or Hollywood the New York times every big city newspaper every magazine if they still exist websites would go absolutely crazy this would be the worst thing in the world\nTo make fun of and sexual lies the parents are Michelle Obama and it should happen I Want the same behavior that would apply to Michelle Obama do apply to him a lot of Trump because they're in the same category doing the same kinds of good things\nMay today earlier today millennia Trump plane filled with smoke on her way I think the Philadelphia and she still made the trip\nThis was a brave courageous woman who's married to a great president but the media wants to make the legitimate both diminish who they are and make them objects of scoring and ridicule\nBecause it plays well I guess what the audience is an
