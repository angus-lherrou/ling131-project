I thought his name was will rain for\nAnyway suggested in one of the tweets that Christine Blasey Ford\nWas not a victim of sexual assault my tweet suggested that she was not a victim of sexual

Nick\nThat will lead the did she witness cabin or the party were girls were drugged and gang raped would be considered the PRP and another universe because of the age difference say all of this is true but you can't say that on a university campus these days\nOkay the John Garber used the president so University of president John Garvey announced a that ring for it and it would be suspended for the remainder of the semester in light of the tweets but protestors weren't satisfied with the suspension\n[noise] matter of fact the president's statement read the Catholic university of America has no position on the Capitol matter\nBut lived there'd be no doubt that our university and particularly our national Catholic school of social service has a special concern for every victim and survivor live sexual so so your assumption is she's telling the truth and I thought you had no position on and you just made one\nYou just made your position clear\nRain for street still the past week or unacceptable so a group of about a hundred or I guess ... wearing protesters demonstrated outside the university students centered yesterday and then they marched to the president's office with a letter demanding rain for his resignation\nMarine ... an assistant dean standing in for rain burden for the rest of the semester met with the protesters and apologize any of them who would\nUh relived past traumas related to sexual assault in as a result of the controversy so if this impulsive and insensitive Bien means you relive your sexual attack\nWe're sorry how does that happen from a tweet\nTwitter account from which rain for me between has been deleted the president of the university also said that while the university was concerned about what it saw as in the insensitivity rain for tweets he'll rain for would continue to lead the school\nWell that probably is not going to happen they'll wait for it to blow over but these things don't blow over with these kinds of crazy folks out there and they can't live at blow over can't let it go over you know Jake Tapper\nHe was on a a co bears and it was called bears yeah late night with Stephen cold beer\nHe says I ever had all women panels lots of times but it is true that this Sunday I felt that we heard from\nMen enough so we don't need to hear from them in any more olden Jake I guess that includes you or you're not a man next thing\nYou know news flash leaves gentleman Fox News alerts Jake Tapper is a transvestite Jake Tapper says we don't need to hear from the men we've heard\nFrom the minute or so human just shut up

in today's heated political climate last year we march this year we run\nLike a girl from Westwood One mind on apple pie and kept them from hot half or wherever you listen to your content\nTo\nUnderstand veil Nashville\nStudio wears off I mean I [noise]\nKavanaugh investigation Trump well I'm In the White House is awaiting the results or the FBI probe into sexual assault allegations lodged against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nAs he headed for a speech in Philadelphia the president said things appear to be going well for Brett Kavanaugh but he edited all all depend on what comes out of the supplemental investigation being conducted by the FBI he indicated it would be unacceptable if Kavanaugh is found to have lied to Congress\nI think you should lie to Congress and then a lot of people over the last year that have lied to Congress to me that would not be acceptable Trump\nThen there's a lot at stake is it there when the federal government is making decisions the fifty states the territories\nAre much less important must less influential\n\nAs the central government gets stronger and\nAnd where and more and more ubiquitous you can't escape it\nWhen the federal government makes a decision it doesn't matter what state you moved to you can escape and it's a winner take all situation like abortion like Obamacare whatever the issue is it's a winner take all that's not at all\nWhat the constitution created and so in many respects where they post constitutional government they post constitutional Supreme Court and on and on and on we absolutely do and I've talked about that at length I've written about it at length\nSo what you're watching now is the breakdown\nOf the constitutional order in the United States Senate respecting the Supreme Court and what's interesting about this is the institution of the United States Senate as it sits today is not what the constitution created\nIt's not what the constitution created you had this progressive movement that became especially strong in the earliest period\nThe turn of the last century the early Nineteen hundreds as it was building in the late Eighteen hundreds and you're the sixteenth amendment the federal income tax which was always\nA desired result for the hard left and then you have the seventeenth amendment which utterly destroy the United States Senate senators are elected way members of the house are elected no they're six year terms of course\nWith or elected by the people of the state the Senate has no actual purpose anymore\nOh I understand treaties and so we're that's not my point in terms of its fundamental foundational\nPurpose it's been bastard us\nThe Senate collectively was supposed to represent the states collectively in the federal Congress\nTo members from each state states would determine how they're chosen that can be elected by the people are very few where they can be selected by the state legislatures most of the more\nBut the so called populism movement and the progressive movement eliminated that\nAnd so you have this kind of pure democracy as opposed to Republicanism\nWhen it comes to the United States Senate and you see the consequences of that you also see the consequences and another institution the United States Supreme court the United States Supreme court even though some of my constitutional is in conservative friends heated Lee disagree with me I'd written about this and the Marlboro versus Madison decision the Supreme Court seized\nPower seized power from the other federal grants\n\nJefferson knew immediately what took place as did other individuals who are believed in diversified a government\nHave libertarians today that argue strongly in favor of Madison versus ... and when you really read the case and you know the history of it it's a ... not only the constitution but the parties involved\nThere is no way Marshall chief justice Marshall should've been involved in that decision I'm not going to go down that road right now I'm just I'm just explaining that the Supreme Court's power today is far beyond anything that was contemplated by the framers of the constitution and certainly the rabbit fires in the states these states\nWe're still very suspicious of the central government and the constitution almost was not ratified in Massachusetts\nIn New York and in Virginia hence the federalist papers the advocates for\n\nTwo of them from New York one of them from Virginia John J. Hamilton and Madison they honestly believe that they had created a governing system that would protect the American people not just from monarchy\nBut for mob rule and more and more we're both\nWith the permanent government in Washington DC and the lifetime appointees when the Supreme Court\nAnd Marlboro\nBecause of the the unraveling of our Republican little are Republican system so you see the development of these factions and the faction on the left has become extremely violent\nExtremely aggressive\nWhich restaurants or at airports whether it's ... teeth are black lives matter\nBefore that other movements in the Nineteen sixties\nThe weather underground and the association between these radical elements\nAnd members elected members of the Democrat Party is really\nQuite shocking absolutely shocking and the association between them and most of our media is unconscionable\nAbsolutely unconscionable this is why the constitution is so important and this is why Republicanism is so important\nAnd the left keeps trying to destroy them one of the reasons if not the main reason that you see the the obliteration\nOf the confirmation process when it comes to the Supreme Court one of the reasons you see it is because Kavanaugh has pro fast he has declared that he's a constitutional is\n\nThe enemy of the progressive state is the enemy\nOf the Democrat leadership in Washington the enemy of the Democrats' Senate members on the Judiciary Committee\nIs the constitution truth be told it's why they always talk about precedent\nNot the text of the constitution not being original meaning of the constitution that's why they always\nDeclare that our original documents our founding document and our governing document\n\nI really do legitimate in many ways you say because too many that people who were involved in the process were slave holders therefore they are to be dismissed or used\nIn order to advance their destruction in the cause of progressive as again you're seeing this play out in the United States Senate not to the extent we're discussing it here intellectually but this is the consequence\nFactions a\nDefamation violence or we're going to take a look\nExactly what I'm Talking about when we return I'll be right back [noise] month\nYou know what's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes by you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Levin L.

short and what did I just hear from somebody they said you know politics or transitory but food is forever and ah my wife and I for the last\nI don't know three or four years I've been writing a cookbook or with the foods that make America happy because the alternative when uh a couple of years ago my wife started to realize\nI mean why do I even ask you what you want for your birthday meal because I Know it's you want me to make your mom's pot roast you know the one with the Lipton onion soup and the cream of mushroom soup you cook it all day and\nShe makes a a a German chocolate cake

years old again I'm I'm In that little house on Margaret street in Russell, Kansas and\nIt's a happy place and everybody it seems that who I've talked to has a happy food I asked Dr oz I said you know I figured this was a kale something but as it turns out it's a it's a German chocolate cake or Sean Hannity or I asked him what he liked\nAnd he said all the foods corn beef and cabbage\nAnd the ... you know here's a guy he could have steak every meal um but I happen to know that's not true well\nHe eats steak every damn meal that I happen to know as a matter of fact but anyway go
