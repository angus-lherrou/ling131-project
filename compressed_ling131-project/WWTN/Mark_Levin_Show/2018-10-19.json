now becoming the devil's in the desert in the future investment initiative nuts won't take by the Saudi led by the crown prince is going to be a major blow and incomes\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from art before\nOr many of you know me I I play tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country as a student\nWith a student visa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws that make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house 'cause I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets you you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation\nIn Saudi Arabia again he hasn't stood with them\nHe said we're investigating we're taking time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter going to a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out there will be a very strong\nResponse from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust some interactions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most scared tending things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with his caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough on this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should come down and should be loving which\nOne is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care venting to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing it saying he's on hands these crazy and he's mean an evil and have so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more\nImportant than average people I'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more\nSignificant in society\nOr shouldn't make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tax they all come and defend and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not and realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who are raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw it let's give 'em a license that will shut up the world\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you\nStill in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut our feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing\nThey will throw people in prison who are dissidents or to criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth and I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia they weren't riding\nThese articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines in his taken alive is because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him\nBut his ... but the media who is acting like this is something we must ... I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are\nWriting these articles it's fake outrage I don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism in that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we all see the place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that a relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agree that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama Obama agrees with Bush Bush trades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other parts of grades that Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter\nWe've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they say this is too strong it's there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean oil is strong with Saudi Arabia because wait a minute because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty for one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your whole life\nMost journalists herself important\nI Can't use the word I Want to use a I Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they're better for example than even talk shows were commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hate it that it's happened I hate to this journalist was killed\nBut make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president I say it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant Caribbean are legal immigrants heading towards America is what a president should do regardless of party you don't welcome all breakers you don't you know I mean what what what is the media wants Donald Trump to do what is it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying this directly the media\nDo they want that will try to go down the border and and and make it a great sense\nWith big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America and break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps and have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump pug\nOne eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven I'll get your reaction you\nCan tweet at me all during the show Ben Ferguson show on Twitter Facebooking semi masters been Ferguson on Facebook as well a lot of there's a lot more coming up on this and the Michael venture been Ferguson filling and we'll be right back on\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule it's a great products\nWe're talking real healthy natural energy ... eight six six to zero five for nine zero seven\nOr go to super beach dot com backslash loved in L.

new I got to tell you that you still need\nOh from the government and I'm going to do it because of a website called ... dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford have five hundred dollar unexpected ... expects\nLet me just explain to you how warped this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first forever proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year and the reason why she wants to give you that money every month is because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase of medical bill or childcare\nSo she wants to give you a government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense\n\nNow my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody who's making\nNine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make sure I say this number correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so all correct it right now are calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for a five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected\nNext expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to say that money because that same dumb a hasn't say five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nRemember when we had the tax credit that came out Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they were they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists around them are right people to save that money they got extra money and they went out and spin it right away don't look at the stats\n\nAirs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month\nOn average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year that they're now going to say that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget\nThis is nothing more than buying votes this is not about ... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey firm Bain great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the crap they're spending their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making the year ... is just liberal and competency at its\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning can you can you let me borrow two hundred\nBucks I don't have it\nMy dad would tell me to drive on the orange fair and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example\nThan I had a flat tire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom look I'm only making fifty grand\nI just had a flat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars do you use their math ... I I Would hope my mom would hang up the phone on me\nIn fact I Hope she would say I'm embarrassed by you your embarrassment to the family get your life together you moron and then hang up on me\nThis is nothing more than buying votes\nThis is nothing more than welfare on a higher level than the welfare that we're currently in that they've been offering instead of food stamps you're offering people\nCash because they're not getting the food stamp the more so you still got to keep them addicted to you\n\nYou still got to get them addicted to you that's what you got to do just get them addicted to you\nWant to seven seven three one\nThirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven then Ferguson filling in for Marco then we'll be right back\nYour data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and sharing your information these are legitimate companies but they're putting you at risk and now you add in all the crux since cameras and the risk of ID theft\nIt's insane look the best thing you can do is protect yourself and your family it's why I switched to my id care for identity protection they're the best in the business with plant starting from less than ten dollars a month and only my\nId care offers a one hundred percent money back\nRecovery guarantee you can sign up at my id cared dot com\nSlash mark my id care has taken care of fortune five hundred companies for years but now\nThey're protection is available to people like you and me and you my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my id cared dot com slash marks enter promo code marks learn more and then let my id care take care of via my id care dot com slash Mario Cuomo called mark that's my\nId care dot com slash marks\nWe will never fully understand what we've asked our military service members or their family\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity at one eight hundred seven nine for over four three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the number and I saw how quickly\nThat astronomical that that was in my life what Galloway\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands what I Would\nTell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a ... grand and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\n... trinity a one eight hundred seven mine for ... for three something that's one eight hundred seven nine for oh four three seven\n[noise]\n\n\nIf your child is shipped over and over again it could be ... by a defect in the immune system that affects millions early detection can give children a chance to dream Jeffrey Modell foundation [noise] twenty five years of helping to reach for their dreams\n... for for the Idaho call one eight six six info for PI\nOr life with Dr Sanjay [noise]\nWell how about Bruce headlines [noise]\nNo amount of alcohol is good\nFor your overall health I'm Dr Sanjay Gupta scene in the medical correspondent I've done a lot of reporting on alcohol over the years and the general consensus has been that drinking in moderation can be beneficial for your health\nBut now a large study published in the medical journal the Lancet finds alcohol is\nThe leading risk factor for disease and premature death in men and women ages Fifteen to forty nine\nIt's possible for nearly one in ten death the researchers say\nEverything from alcohol related cancers and cardiovascular disease traffic accidents and intentional violence the study's authors as we used to hearing that he\nDrink or two a day is fine but the evidence is the evidence look the takeaway here for me if you enjoy drink every now and then it's probably okay I just wouldn't start drinking and the name of your health\nOn Dr Sanjay Gupta helping you live a better life\nAre veterans were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life [noise] let them know we can join me as a pro supporter of our veterans Hi this is Joe Montana and on the one hundredth anniversary of Veterans Day help no vet alone improve the lives of those who have served our country\nPlease show your support and text V.

S. M. C. A.\nHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border all Democrats fault for week laws\nThat was the president spot on for doing this I Would say absolutely\nOne eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven and I want to go back to Barbara Barbara go ahead with your point\nThen they spend my passion for Twenty years and I've written on it and I ran for office on it and multiple things that I studied it for three years down here I live in Houston I bet a victim of six years ago there are thousands of cases that are coming that Tony that make it to the book\nWhere I had one come in my house with life in hand and almost killed me that aren't even making it to the court system I beg\nPresident Trump to listen to all of tax and that they are they are pouring over the borders eyes or ten years that he calls the southern border because we are getting inundated with very they already then making that credit card debt\nAnd I wanted to tell you sip our fast or south side of our tickets to the Trump rally Monday Night they looked at venue some energy to Toyota Center you cannot imagine how palm Texans are\nWhere oh they're they're they're so thrilled about this um and and look I I think I I talk I talk to Trump in and he's prompt and he's he's he's a big fan of Ted Cruz they bury the hatchet since\nThe presidential primary got nasty there on the same team they're working together um you also have a great working relationship between the two on Capitol Hill or are they have a very good relationship the vice president and Ted Cruz and and even Donald Trump junior\nHas come down in health and helped out Ted Cruz as well and I think what you're going to see on Monday Night is getting the people in Texas fired up to beat a this candidate that wants to open borders and says vote for me and all impeached Donald Trump which is not how this country's laws work\nWell and he wants he wants to take our guys you don't take our guns in fact this nine out of ten people carry yes only carry you don't come here and say you're going to take our kinds I cricket bats that it it's got to be a landslide victory across\nI I Hope you're right but I'm I I Am cautious about it because I think that we were in trouble or just from not paying attention or people feel secure in and I I Try to explain this the other day on TV\nThe reason why Democrats are doing well is because there is mad as we were when Obama was in office at the end right and so they're furious third a fever pitch\nA lot of people if you've got if you feel like things are under control and Donald trumps of president and you feel good about it and you feel like you're doing a good job and doing the right thing and lives getting good and you can enjoy life you're not as focused because you're not married you're not frustrated I Believe that Ted Cruz was in serious trouble from just\nLack of a of enthusiasm because people feel secure it they were comfortable and how things are going in Texas how things are going in Washington\nWith Donald Trump being the president and now uh because of the character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh because Democrats have already said they're campaigning on you give us a control the house for the Senate we will impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump is re engage the base and fire them up\nAnd that's why you're going to see the same we sold out on Monday Night you're gonna see standing room only you're going to see thousands at won't get in in Houston on Monday Night and ... and and and and that is in under reported by the media guaranteed\nThat they're saying that winning down here that women are serious with what happened to cap it off because that's what happened that everybody's husbands and wives and children are winning down here are so\nEnergized because they overplay their hand and and it's an ethical state where a loving state we love our country down here that women are very very vocal down here and we got some strong conservative limit out\nOr to fill the vacuum a and so I I don't think we'll see that right now we've seen oil actually come down over the last week or we're now basically where we were a month ago on the oil markets and so I'm unless we do something drastic ah to Saudi Arabia to impact their oil supply\nOr one would think that we're we're very much in in the realm of eighty dollar a a crude at this point on on the brands\nAnd I hate to think of it being political but everything's political it it would to me um unimaginable to Trump will do anything about Saudi Arabia before November six because that may have some kind of impact on the oil prices so we're probably going to see all of this taking care of after the midterm elections right\n[noise] yeah I think that uh you know ... to ... get some sort of answers this week or maybe even today or tomorrow\nI'm I think that they're on a timeline or that is presumably separate from politics uh but uh you know the timing may work out that that's something does happen after the terms of just because that's how the investigation rolls out\nInteresting Richard Goldberg with the foundation for defense of
