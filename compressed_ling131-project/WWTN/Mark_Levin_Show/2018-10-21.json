I I don't want to name a possible out your boss will sponsor a future sponsor so I'll just say there's a place it is called bone marrow bread\n[laughter] talking and code [laughter] and they have their yesterday [laughter] amazingly\nDelicious food yes to the Greek salad ... it's the best out I've ever had booked every single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of ... era I developed this seven foot ... what's that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you\nBut if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not\nGoing to do that if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my ... pay a lot of farmers market I bought spinach pasta whose twelve dollars for one thing of pasta and they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not okay so my hair stylist\nLovely lovely young woman named Nicole and\nYou know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is and what I Love about Nikolas she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional she's on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen and and for somebody her age to have this type of business at command something\nShe uses square and to you know when you pay\nAnd so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty\nPercent so I told her I said you know I said you've got this all rock and she's like what are you me and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to have and there'll be a certain percentage\nThat will that you can guilt them into going to you know the third call it which is the goal of all business you have people out of more money\nSo I told her explained to her I said so you know you're married you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old\nLittle pictures up there the kids you know and you know in the rye and they need new you know they're getting ready for college and their cheek bones we can really hungry [laughter] whatever it may\nBe a said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty percent or just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nFee if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I should so out of work out she goes\nMy gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and some people are going like thirty percent\nBut the ... isn't that different though because that industry has a history of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great\nSo when you're a bone marrow do you tip yeah really I Do that and why they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay here's the reason\nWhy gay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston ... and when you wait tables and I also waited tables I when I was at a a shoe\nAt a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at that so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but a bad but ...\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's and I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent like eight hundred dollars or something and probably had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right\nOne was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android\nOne didn't have anything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks\nTo honor that\nAnd they uh they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is how big of a\nForty five foot and behind that you have your ...\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot charter that we haul her car\nAnd which is a\nUm an eighty to ... or no true core but\nOkay so you get this where everybody has the picture and um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we're in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been serving\nWell great things I mean every day's an adventure and what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have\nA full size a refrigerator Airbus and if you're ... decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up there\nSo systems to take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there are kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing is huge so I'm the last we heard a was that we have to take out the side windows\nAnd pick up outside and basically toss it out the window I'm short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your mother board in the refrigerator while\nIt's very possible that if you change them I ... back in business and sure enough that's what we did\nAnd that was that that was it off it was\nIt was it was an ordeal et cetera on an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even doing the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\n[laughter] I [laughter] All right so Andrew but ... I Want you to loosen up because how has a technical question that I bet you're you will have input on Phil how give us a question\nOf basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies back from the old days watching the kids grow up and some of my early days ranchers which I don't know if I Want everybody to see but we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA state of obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D. P. side which is a file transfer site but we can get out for our kids to be able to jump on there and dragged that\nTwenty two gig radio uh back on to their own computers so that was the best person that we know that knows about all things digital or we decided to call the gym commando show so here you're dealt\nIn so who was the thought of as Andrew is that they use like a drop box or something like that right and the money to gig that's huge it's really a huge huge\nHuge and so unless you could you know you can break it out into individual videos right and then you too might be the best place that's what I was thinking too is a you just put it up there and then it can play and then if somebody wants to download it they can download if they want to\n... and then you can delete it\nYou want to you or your protective yeah you can protect and put it in on a you know with a um a private you are oh oh okay\nSo that if somebody is searching for you know how big adventure which we all because\nI mean All right then\nThey do that how big adventures doesn't quite come up while he totally miss you guys\n[laughter] well we wish to it's a very much for pleasure grab all to talk to you today\nYeah barely know break up the files put it up on YouTube and when you guys come back out we're going to do years three of ...\nAnd Jackie on the road because if you're in our here they have a lot of lessons that mother board story that they can pass along and they're really really great good godly people and I love them dearly thank you my good friends say right where you are more coming up here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life\nParents teachers dentist and always a different technique\nUp and down sideways my dentist says to make sure that however I Do it I should do it for a full two minutes of course Ninety percent of us don't emotional issues worn out toothbrushes to boot so let me introduce you to quit quit is electric it's small light and sleek\nThere's a built in two minute timer that pulses every thirty seconds to remind you to switch sides with quit new brush heads are automatically delivered just as dentist recommend every three months for just five dollars\nTrying to quit and see wide backed by more than twenty thousand dental professionals quit starts to just twenty five dollars that's it does it get quip dot com slash came right now and get your first refill pack for free with any quip electric toothbrush your first refill package free at G.

don't worry about writing this down we have some more information over a commander dot com\nA dead you're going to need to think I'm all up and then you're going to need to add some spooky sounds and so that's very few labs\nAnd it has Halloween living scenes and she will Halloween which is an abba Hugh haunted house those are some uh lighting and music ... there are ways that you can still step up to a game\nAnd get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and the sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nToo great to talk to you but thanks so much for your call today sure what's going on I Would say I'm a small theater group so we put on three employees a year that are in an old movie theatre here in ... and oh how cool is that it's\nAlso well I'm told all it does have a good ... on the total news is a A R keys to do at church to call the tractors to all these people and we get a look at the ... and so we got from the keys floating\nAll that's all over the county everybody's got to\nEverybody's got to the key to this place but we were having a large I control it so our idea is to one of the day or school we'd like to put like a digital type law sure that we can program was codes and give the\nNow is the truth lots of ... automatically explode or twenty four hours or ... or ... or whatever is needed for that and the second to it is a lot of ... the little due to to a program like the on site\nBut it was ... all such such nobody will step with all the time\nRight [noise] well she does it bother you know the good news is is that the technology exists the even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use ... almost two and so when you buy the smartest lock is\nThat a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have a a a v R B o house that I own is that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay\nAnd so when somebody books through ... and be I can go and I can put their name in and I can\nSay this law is going to work on this Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre okay\nAnd you put the person's name in there and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program this right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use those ... Gluck if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet type\nEvent you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next hop okay and then within the next year Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do\nSo like if you wanted certain lights to come on and the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's\nThere so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nKim Dotcom and for just a few bucks a month you can watch the show you can get the pod cast chat with all the great folks in the chat room because they're fabulous by the way\nAnd then we have contests you can come see the show and the list goes on and on the on the head over to get Kim Dotcom once again that's get Kim Dotcom get all three hours of the show it's great for when you're walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona a low there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well I have a\nQuestion uh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd I have a a website that I have one phone line right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I'd been toying with the idea of putting a ...\nA function I'm not sure what you call it a in the Web site where people could ask questions before they came in and the the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you were you know is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as\nThe employment of people to support that\nAre the questions and whatever you you know all of his article\nYeah oh really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we were deployed shop dot commando dot com and uh you know we put a chat function in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing you know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you\nHaving a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone in place so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function somehow that would work because they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them than those who are very question so I Would give the managers as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question nobody she they had the the canned answer that I've already given that of course those soon 'cause she goes to those dirty flushing\nYeah ... and say here's the reason why I'm having a painting the fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor\nI'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our business is that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself or my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get\nAnd you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office said you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that he will engage will be people that you can convert to a a pain client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like then desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building it for you\nOr yes although the we do have a website it's already been built and we have another company building\nOr another website all over but but when we have a third tempting does calling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add\nLet the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters do kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also lift some of those questions under ... choose as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats in boats and things like that\nOr is it you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad news out here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know

podcast a family strong pod cast with jeopardy so all pod cast platforms you want to talk to my Bones Are open six one five seven three seven nine nine eight six hey here's an excuse I often take students through\nIt's actually not an excuse it's it's an it's an exercise we find so many students making excuses for their poor choices and we often find it that students really when they when they pause to to move past excused and really think about their choices\nThey realize yeah man I've got I've got to take ownership in what I'm doing it who I'm spending time with so how often take them through this exercise to move past the excuse\nTo get to the heart of the matter so here's the up and have students do I encourage students I had them do this this weekend at the student it's due to ... make a list\nOf the five choices you most regret making\nParents you might want to do this to her that this may be a great exercise for you to do with your students during your family time this week that we're always dress in the Early Show\nHave your kids make a list of the five most regrettable choices they've ever made\nMaybe you'd want to stop and have them do it right now maybe they can't think of five maybe it's for maybe it's too they don't have to share the list with you the important thing is not necessarily sharing the list but thinking about the list so I Hope you'll have them do this and then have them do this beside beside each regrettable choice have them write them\nThey were in who they were with when they made that regrettable choice\nAnd in doing so more times than not I find that when it comes to regrettable choices a majority of students tell me they usually don't make these regrettable choices alone\nNo many times there was a friend oftentimes a very close friend a boyfriend or girlfriend at a party on a date on line with their devices I find all too often when students really begin to think about the regrets\nThey realize more times than not I am making regrettable choices when I'm with my friends is I often tell Gen Z students again who you spend time with\nShakes the choices you make friends equal time time equals influence\nInfluence equals character in character shapes your choices here's a few more questions you hope your son or daughter consider their life as it relates to their friendships some great questions for you to write down tonight to take to them so how's your character I think we need to have more conversations with our kids\nAbout the choices are making helping them understand how their character drives those choices so ask you a student did consider what's my character all about how as it relates to friendships\nHow's my character or my friendships shaping my character here's a great question do you find yourself making choices today that you wouldn't have made if you didn't have the fringe you have\nHas a really good ones are are you making choices today that otherwise you would not have made if you had a different set of friends at the answer is yes\nThen had these choices taking you down a road you regret\nThat's I think what's really important it isn't just the fringe you have and the choices you make but all the choices you're making with their friends you have taken you down roads you regret you see the friends your son or daughter has impact who your son or daughter becomes\nIt's just that simple let me say that again the friend\nDoes your son or daughter have impact who your son or daughter become so how do they know if\nThey've chosen the ride friends that's a really important question well initially you can always make that call but fortunately we've got some help with this tonight this is the middle of the night\n\nIn the mail of a night [noise]\n\nIs sponsored by cinco

have just moved into a new home in a new city at his previous school Jacob had some really good friends here\nHe's having a tough go of things she's made friends with a few guys his age but after we let him spend the night at one of the young man's home we began to see and noticed a change in our son Jake\nHe doesn't talk with us as much as we believe he has in the past\nAnd we really believe that there's this influence of other friendships it's affecting him we know friendships are so important are so important to his value system in his confidence however we want him to understand that just because someone chooses you listen to this is a really important statement that this parrot made\nHe says we we want him to have good friends but he says this we also want him to understand that just because someone chooses you that doesn't mean you choose them in return isn't that really good\nI Know this may mean that he loses these friends we want him to know that sometimes choosing character about friends means you just might have less friends any help you can offer us are placed in scripture you can lead us to will be greatly appreciated sincerely a concerned parent\nWow this is the limit parents that are often see your child badly wants to be accepted I talked to a kid about this week this weekend at the event where I spoke those who accept him or her aren't necessarily

of it because I think that's what a lot of people missed they don't understand the value comes in lots of different ways we call it value ladders\nAnd again obviously there's an initial process malicious code that you get with the ... in the health risk assessment and then you get your training which is another value and then you get a lifelong coaching which is another value on education
