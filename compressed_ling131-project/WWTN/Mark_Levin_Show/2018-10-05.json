healthy attitude toward\nA morality and toward God\nWe ... we share the same absolute values and these values guide us and govern our society and our hire a constitutional framework is based on those values and no other country\nIn the history of the world even comes close\nTo the principles that under this a constitutional republic there were some great empires but they were empires America's not even an empire and as if the most powerful nation in the history of the world that could have dominated and taking over the world but it has been benign it has been selfless\nAnd not selfless that his

me as a non Christian [noise]\nUm you write beautifully you write in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way down [noise] or you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that uh and uh and\nAnd you can see the uh the decency in your writing the earnest this in your writing and uh and you raised a point earlier when we were talking or in the first segment\nAnd that is and just mentioned it again the founding of this nation people need to understand\nOr is that the men who founded this nation not all of them but almost all of them were Christians who met at the uh who met and I'm On July Fourth would the declaration of independence and men in Philadelphia again in the constitution\nAnd look at what they did even look at the first amendment what they did they didn't us tablets your religion even though they could have potentially\nAnd yet they allow freedom of religion so in other words these are Judeo Christian attitudes and principals the reformation all these things that affected these faiths\nAnd so while people may say well I'm an atheist while I I I you know I'm I'm this religion I'm of that and I ... and I don't agree with you\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say\nThat the founders of the country the framers of the constitution were not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men do face were they not\nYes and and that's been documented him and\nA lot of people want to do that because it again the interests of the secularists to uh Shay to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and
