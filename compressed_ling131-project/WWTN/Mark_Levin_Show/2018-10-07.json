remember in marriage that it's not about me and we got to put our spouses before ourselves\nIn marriage thrived not by surviving you can't survive and thrive it's just not going to happen so we got to work so that we secondly don't get stuck\nWe can't become casual and complacent because complacency eagles compromise it's just it's just a matter of time you become complacent eventually you compromise so it's not about me\nDon't get stuck let me give you another one listen\nListen let me say that we're one more time listen I'm telling you I'm seeing the list of what I'm covering tonight in the slapping me ride upside the head point number one is not about me and point number two making marriage mad herbs means I I Can't get stuck but it's it's point number three listening\nWell that's a huge one opening your heart\nTo your spouse requires listening and let's face it this can be easier said\nThan done you guys hear the story about the elderly man who started having a difficult time cheering\nHis wife said hey let's let's go to the doctor and get this checked out so they go to the doctor and the doctor just simply says so you're you're getting older and so it's probably going to be important for you if you want to remember things\nYou need to write down things because you're having a hard time in the listening category right now so he suggested that at the old man started writing things down well you could imagine that didn't sit well the old man he got home later that night he and his wife are in the living room\nWatching a little TV show she says you know what I could I could go for some ice cream and he says maybe I got as we get up and goes into the kitchen and while you're walking into the kitchen she says I Want to scoop summing up and you probably should write it down like the doctor said so you won't forget he mumbles under his breath I don't need right to stand ... nothing wrong with my ear and I'm I'm just fine\nAnd she says you know what go ahead and had a couple of strawberries and sprinkle some pecans on top and write it down so you don't forget again he says I don't need to write anything down I can I can listen just fine well she hears a lot of banging pots and pans about ten minutes later he comes\nOut of the kitchen in the living room with a plate of scrambled eggs\nTo pieces a toast his wife looks\nIm looks at the eggs looked at him and says where's the making of ordered you hear the [noise]\nThank you very much for the support didn't know that was it was either that or you were going to do something that's got a little bit more like the\n\n... ... ... that's what usually happens when I'm speaking on the road that joke there's usually sides listen listening [laughter] I Love that joke it's so stupid but it's so good listening requires focus sometimes that requires a lot of focus because let's face it you guys know this life is busy\nWith issues and obligations and devices and responsibilities and chores and kids and bills in the yard work people pulling that you from all directions this it can be difficult to slow down\nAnd truly focus and listen particularly when we're talking about a spouse listening can be pleasant but so died it is down right hard look I Can't stress enough to have a healthy thriving marriage it's critical to truly learn to listen\nTo your spouse so let me let me quickly offer you a few ways to help you when it comes to listening well to your husband or your wife listening challenge number one listen through compassion\nListen to ... what what what about me mad is well when you listen with compassion is as if you were putting yourself\nIn your spouse issues seeing things through his or her eyes whether you're trying to resolve the conflict there just simply listening to your spouse talk about their day it is beneficial to both of you to listen with compassion when your spouse his speaking for you\nIt gives you this this window of opportunity into the world their perspective and knowing that you're listening it just make someone feel secure if you've ever been in a conversation\nAnd someone begins to look elsewhere looking at their TV looking at a device you know immediately immediately you had that feeling as though they're employed they're just interested me think about this your spouse has a tough day they walked through the door\nOr a sibling or a parent that you're now taking care of his combative or just mean you come home\nSo your husband needs to vent about something it's been a tough day you've got a son or daughter who's just going through some stuff and the two of you begin to talk of the\nYour spouse starts talking and you're kind of listen to you kind of switch your mind off half way through and maybe the TVs there maybe your district listen we all know I don't need to explain it it is so easy to be distracted\nAnd that's where I really liked about two three sixty it was simple and then I'm feeling a powder that by the way of taste phenomenal remember that old saying oh yeah we used to it yeah I think it tastes like thing and sometimes I have to remind myself that I've already taken so I don't take it to you in that big isn't really taste good\nBut it's simple it's easy it's one time there in the morning one of the afternoon and I think the more simple you can make it for people in a crazy stressful lifestyle that we live today um you're going to win because\nJust like with managing money in helping people become this one with a budget and things of that nature if it's too painful Scott they will quit doing it or natural tendency is to stop in retreat in pain\nAnd I love the way\nYou've built the program they'll two three sixty to take the steps it is a marathon I think if somebody is out there listening to um tonight and they're looking for a sprint you know get healthy quick uh there's probably not the right deal but if you really want that slow marathon I Want to feel great for life and live a better life\nUm this is a great opportunity for them to do that\nAnd I think coach you know he brings up a great point is that people are many times you talk about the right turns out I was reminded of just how the the culture that we live in today\nBeing so fast and so frantic and\nAnd now we have more means of connecting with people than we've ever had before but yet we're lonely or people than we've ever been before we we can we can reach out with social media and face time and used to be we used to have to get me going to get on an airplane and you can be cross country to see the\nThe family that you haven't seen all year within a matter of hours and used to be ... I remember my grandparents putting us in the car and going out you know down to Alabama or Mississippi and car smell like Kentucky Fried chicken and feet and I'm also died again we give us it's not like Kentucky Fried chicken feet all day long and ... and and the trip down there\nWas longer than the visit you understand what I'm saying to you how do they live in such a crazy chaos world everything is so fast and the ... such quick gratification and nobody wants to put it in the time and effort in work that it takes really\nBut health is one of those things you can't rush and so I always tell people don't rush the process trust the process right now and if your trust to process what you'll find on the other side is you'll find the real you but it takes time it takes\nEffort it takes commitment and takes dedication I think it was a Greg you had mentioned is the difference between interested and committed is the is the bacon and eggs or the ... the chicken was committed or was interested but the but the pig was committed 'cause he ate\nWhat all and then I gave it all up or are you gave it all up so ... as us because of the segment\nOr what would you share with somebody that's maybe sitting on the fence maybe listen to our show for years and never really taken that next step to investigate what L. T. three sixty is all about it at least from a a a ... perspective but you know they just seen is from the perimeter\nHow would you how would you encourage them to take the next step\nTheir health yeah again you know I think a lot of people go to Scott a lotta times are looking for the pivotal moment life to kind of happened to you or happened to my dad who you know you know died kind of right almost from a heart attack and was it you know a looked healthy felt healthy\nAh but I Would encourage those folks out there to understand that that tomorrow is not a guarantee\nI mean the only guarantee we have is the moment that we're in right now and for some reason I think we've convince ourselves especially in western civilization and our culture that time as a commodity", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "07"}
