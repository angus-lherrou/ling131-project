the back unless you have a mold for you and it's going to charge it there's no reason to have\nA case well that's what the Internet was attacking you know there's stupid okay here's the other reason why you need a case corners right well that's just that but you notice the color right a very pretty good minds pink\nMy black okay but the reason why it's tank is so that when I throw it into my

to have\nAnd I learned something which surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter] I've never heard about password walking you never heard a password walking never that's where are you\nThe keys and Reuters for you to enter in your\nPassword most popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are getting back to the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across ...\nAnd then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose will go down three\nRight back to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is much worse to row\nAnd let me tell you something if you were just look at that as a password you'd be like that's a darn good password exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol for most you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords arm's throw it down I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\nLike what was your a second grade teacher his middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's the way to to step verification is so great\nEspecially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but

that were used in the morning and this is really a tough one I don't know if these two stories are connected I think they might be and I buy the blonde hair [laughter]\nMy space and linked in yeah just use it as their password but what's that Mustang that's probably the these are brands are so Mustang Ferrari people like to use car names as their passwords playboy that's a brand Skittles again a brand of anybody you can use the passwords Skittles\nIf you're not using it for your skills account [laughter]\nOkay so don't use linked in as your LinkedIn account password no when it comes to

fifties we have a some history attacks and great podcast tech news today tech news this week you can\nGet all of our podcast on Apple's podcaster on Google clay or get your podcasts or\nHead over to our website over at pot net dot com once again that's ... net dot com and\nBack to the phones we go with Tom in Peoria, Illinois hello there Thomas\nHello Hi welcome what's going on\nBut well the question I had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource folks in something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver as that what's happening\nIs that part of it yeah or I I ended up using a nap or using a program to accomplish the task I get done and I go\nThere look they're an easier way to do that I have an example okay that we'd babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer the shit\nHere's what I did at grandma's house on Tuesday surfing I ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in touch it ended up being thirty five pages long about chipped keys to sixty photos\nBut it was a short it was really hard you know what I thought that there are publishing program but maybe it could help me do that that are\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the reviews people are brutally honest\nAbout what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew or you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that you've got these but you know making photo books is a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nIn one of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and 'cause I ... a a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word ... called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know one no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book but that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to come to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so in to the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay okay I mean that's why we're here and

this and back to the phones we go with a let's see Tim and young ville Louisiana\nHim hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right here all\nMy question it's okay to ... all along reputation management I guess my first let's be like well with me the best ... that I can find full small medical office and also when I was looking at it that was all Oreo a software that you just and then the\nThe F ... the search engine optimization out that go with an old all ...\nAll right well let's talk a little bit so so what's going on with your business on line\nAll the problem has been with them or if\nIt's obviously what most businesses have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bed ridden with balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people have experience it's usually doesn't go on line at the post there the\nPositive experiences with you at your business so what am I doing here mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business along\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation\nType management farm okay [noise] is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay because as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right\n[noise] right and so what\nI Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the medical it's like ... great the current okay maybe they use excel\nSo okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative\nIf you have to accelerate the positive okay bill anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews\nThink of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you\nKnow if they had a great time they're happy to do that and you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before you say you know can you help on line and\nJust drop some rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this or that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam I get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization\nAnd to learn what it is before you hire a firm because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search

this\nJust imagine she's in front of five hundred plus teenagers last night a camp and she said that she said I've been cutting for years it's been a secret of mine for a long time\nShe said I also think it's been my escape from everything going on at home\nThis week I've taken the steps to begin trusting God more my life I loved I loved that she said this a freshman got I'm Jacob ... he was in high school he stood in front of all of that and I said I've had a secret for a long time he didn't see what the secret was I assume by his comments that followed he was referring to pornography\nBut he did say it felt good to finally talk about it\nAt this camp just like all the camps for us speak they have counselor sometimes pastors available to talk to those kids who just need to unpack some stuff I mean let me tell you about one more team Casey Casey told us that night that she had been struggling with depression for a long time\nShe explained that she had never told anyone about any of her feelings and that she had kept it all a secret out of fear of what others might think\nI picked these three brief stories to tell you it's an eye because each of these teams will but they each had a lot more to say but each of these teams when they shared that and I used the word secrets\nIt gives you a vision for your future and then it motivates you to take action if forces you to focus in on your why and it helps you place a priority on your time and your resources so that you can make the most of of your life\nAnd again when you're setting these type of goals for yourself when you believe in yourself when you clearing out all those negative belief systems and and those negative in our conversations you know it'll allow it allows you to take a you know pride in yourself and and then you start to believe again you start to\nMonitor the conversation and again one of the things I always teach people and tell people is that you can't expect what you don't inspect\nYou've got to stop sometimes and take up a pause moment and take a hard look at your life because many people won't ever do that and that's why they stay in the same position year over year in year again that's why it's important\nTo understand that every one of us needs to kind of build every one of those needs a coach somebody needs them I mean we need mentors we need people that we can look up to and we can hold on to win those times do get tough\nAnd so when most people say I I I've waited too late to come in or I Wish I Would have come to we had a guy today or this week that came in and said coach I waited I probably would've two years after hearing you guys on the radio two years\nAnd I'm finally here and just think I could have been two years down the road and I would have avoided so\nMany of these health issues and so much of this pain that I've lived in and lived under if I would've just known what I Know today I Would have went back but here's what I'm telling you let me just give me some encouragement out there\nThat's your history that's in the past\nAnd coach you know you've heard me to teach this a long time you got to let go of your history you've got to let go of your past your past is not ever going to take you to your future and so when you learn to release your history it will allow you to get into your destiny and if you don't learn to release your history it will choke the life out of your future\nNo question 'cause as as you look at the three sixty in just a ... and you understand what we're trying to do that that is just a great value of health is the great value of health\nThat we're offering you okay uh so uh you know as you think about that\nUm again coach is a great motivator he inspires and that's it you know at some time and that's one of the last so long but you got to get motivated inspired to get started\nAnd then we got coaches who helped or keeping motivated inspired a ... if you use them uh but there's also got to be that strong foundation it's like when we were coaching basketball coach you can motivate all you want but you can have the access to those in there the foundation or really hold onto when things got tough you know that ...\nThat pre game crowd ra ra ra you know could could wear off pretty easily pretty quickly\nCoach chairs don't guard you're back I Know in in practices would have put those chairs up and act like they were defenders you know how it is you do your ball him than drills and you go in and out of those chairs and cared chairs don't guard you back up again you may could you make a great point a motivation is is a you know from the outside in that's that's I was trying to get you to take the first step\nInspiration is what you're looking for you're looking for something that lasts long after the motivation you ... its fourth\nQuarter of your life now is the third quarter of your life now and you see that the shot clock is running down again you're down by twenty what are you gonna do you're looking for motivation no there's something inside of you that says I still have time on the clock I my there still time for me to make a change there still time for me to hit that
