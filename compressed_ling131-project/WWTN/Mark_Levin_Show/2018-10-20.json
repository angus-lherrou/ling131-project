broadcast news on a daily basis with regard to the Democrats are acting hysterical about this president and about this administration than this is a no brainer\nThis really is a no brainer you cannot give Joaquin Castro\nAny more power than he already has in the house of representatives frankly has too much as it is\nAs a junior congressman from Texas He shouldn't be on that committee with that

hit with an enemies with [noise] to the ground for the NBA or Saudi Arabia\nHe goes on international TV and delivers that and then when everyone starts screaming ... I mean and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the Daily Beast a website which is which is a new left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that Joaquin Castro did that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walk back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah blah blah blah blah and of course there is no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy Harlow over there and CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay congressman Castro\nUh I understand your statement saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what you did intend to say because it seems pretty dang clear what you said\n\nAnd and and here's the best part of his denial that\nNever got any follow up and never got any challenge and it's just accept that oh well he's ... he says he didn't intend to do that so let's just take him at his word they didn't intend to it he said all I said\nWas there was reporting to the effect that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate I you see and now and now that's\nThat's the crux of it

it's thirty five years old and nothing anything close to the allegations she made against now justice Kavanaugh had ever been made up until this point\nBut what the Democrats say what how the allegation is out there and it's very serious so it needs to be investigated in fact we need an FBI investigation and it needs to take weeks\nAnd weeks and not liking Castro yeah with and it's being reported so it needs to be investigated and that's the next two years of your life\nWell the New York times is reporting this so it needs to be investigated the Huffington Post is not reported this I don't know if it's true or not but it's very serious it needs to be investigated\n[noise] I think Republicans if they're smart and Jews let's be clear the jury is out on that\nThey need to start

C. W. A. L. the the uh ... station for your nation's capital so I Know are these think tanks right Kato was a think tank that focuses on free market principles and ideas and a libertarian\nOr concepts and

thing at the end of it you know we did like an hour and a half presentation on stage and before we were done he said you\nKnow I Want to say one more thing get good all the ladies stand up because the women in the room stand up and it was more than half of the room and it was so great that he did that and and and I loved having there's still a bunch of women on the line wanting to get in\nBecause there's this there's this fake phony despicable myth that's perpetuated\nAbout talk radio about what we do here when we when we discuss big important ideas and conservative principles and values and we have this free flow of information and exchange of perspectives and they\nWill lie to you wouldn't say it's just angry white men angry white men angry white men it's always angry white men and I'm not angry are you angry I mean I mean there are some things in this country that if you're not angry ... years something wrong with you but I approached this from an angry perspective I Know that you don't\nAnd and you don't care what color I Am I don't know what color you are why is it always angry white men they think I'm In and so when you when you specifically say I'd like to hear from women boy I can tell you I've been doing a talk radio for years now the big markets and across the country and when you say women I like to hear from you\nBoom those phone lines just explode because oh let me tell you something there is no way you can grow and expand\nThe kind of of the communication product that has been growing and expanding for talk radio over these last decades by just being a a just targeting\nAngry white men it's a myth it's a ...\nHi ... they love to say about what we do here because they're ... they don't want a new generation of listeners the last thing they want\nIs for a men and women in their twenties that's when people start listening to talk radio when they're done with the idiots who play music and and uh blow the the ... a bicycle foreign and ring the cowbell and make jokes about a body parts and they they start to get real jobs and have to wear long pants\nAnd have bills and are making money and they see how much is getting taken out of their paycheck\nAnd they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know what's going on out there\nThan it usually happens in your late twenties early thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious way and it terrifies\nBut the mainstream media it terrifies the gate keepers in the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets radio television newspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge of the Internet\nWhen was the last time you actually bought a newspaper\nI mean unless you ride the subway in New York when was the last time right\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they put the lie out there they

that Washington Post journalist your mouth shook she died inside the Saudi counseling and this one ... two weeks ago Saudi authorities confirmed that thing he died of an apparent chokehold during an altercation during a roundtable event in Arizona President Trump was asked how his administration will address the situation\nIf you could name one thing the Trump stood for it was enforcing our borders and building a wall to protect our southern border there's no two ways about\nThis I Know that there was a lot else going on in this election or the the uh antipathy for Hillary Clinton uh the the you know decades of of her\nThey eat invading our living rooms in a very shrill and unlike away or the idea of Trump being the person to name Supreme Court justices versus Hillary Clinton or the promise to tax cut the rejection of identity politics there was a lot baked into the cake and the twenty sixteen election\nThe economy trade all those things but the Senate all aside from it if you ask the men on the street named me one issue Trump ran on the vast majority would be\nBuilding that well and protecting our border and Republicans I understand why in some cases but Republicans did not follow through for him they just\nDidn't\nAnd they'll tell you is because the Democrats do it in the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of a threat of government shutdown they'll tell ya lots of reasons\nIt doesn't matter they've had the majority and if they wanted to if they really really\nWanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other deep pocketed interest groups who do not want\nOur immigration laws enforced as they're written\nWar it's because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing they didn't get elected so that they could get reelected I don't know anybody who votes\nThinking yeah I'm going to put this person in the house of representatives so the two years from now they can win reelection I I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them and get\nTheir job is not to keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn and forcing our immigration laws and protecting our border\nAnd and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next step I learned O'Connor in for Merkel event hey Darryl\nLarry how you doing guys though I've watched I've watched\nThe border over the years grew up in a Chandler, Arizona and you know they actually had a here they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they got to basically everything ... they're welcome more than the citizens and that and your people standing in line trying to do it the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think walls don't work job after the Israelis\n[laughter] yeah exactly you know they're all it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger people didn't cross the border because if you remember a that movie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong who was born in east LA\nYou remember that and it was a parody song the day that he did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him on the run\nFrom border patrol and from immigration officials who are trying to deport him\nRight hey if oh\nIf only that really were the case in fact what what what has changed for God's sake that wasn't a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... I Can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean McCain has been there forever I mean obviously is not no longer with us but uh\nIt just that it's slowly that came in more and more and more and then they became later and later on the consequences of when you get here and then now they're actually given them benefits like hey we'll take care of you know you want to have you know four or five kids go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough foreign Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years\nAnd they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they'd been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship whenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I could get a hold on\nI'm sure there's a lot there here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding\nAnd they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally\nFor years and years and years\nAnd they've got a job and they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they've got a job that means they are by their lied\nAbout their documentation or they're using ... documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument\nIs complete and total nonsense [noise]\nIf someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes they are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had been truly and on a regular basis\nBreaking the law and the fact is one party in this country apparently still cares\nAbout keeping our laws enforced\nOr speaking of east LA let's go to Ken in Los Angeles where my my adopted\nMy my first adopted home now Washington is my second adopted him you're listening on the great age seven to the answer Carol a\nOr a tense what do you make of this\n... where I wanted to ... talk to people about getting out and vote and I think that falls pole and ah [noise]\nAre convinced so for showing and

use it for an older voted for President Trump flew the primary\nIn about twenty five percent of the general\nI'm sure you see there are a lot of people that aren't voting and I think actually most of whom were both conservative and figure it out and voted\nYet it can do you think though at this point after what we saw in twenty sixteen and and with the new trends with regard to polling and how you know people don't even answer the phone on their cell phone if they don't recognize the number did you think people still do believe these polls do you think that uh I I think that people just inherently\nUh believe that these polls are phoney and fraudulent they they're I mean when was the last time they were accurate\nYeah well I think often that's probably the case but it's similar to the fore Anders that people don't actually believe the ... for what they believe is that other people will believe him and they won't get out the vote share they think they're that\nLives in ... that is definitely the danger and and and Ken thank you for the call out there in LA uh I I don't disagree with you that is a danger I think though that this president the fact that he's rallying and going out and doing these rallies or several times a week between now and election or the fact that the the Kavanaugh\nHearing I still believe resonates and I do want to believe that that was a motivating factor for people I think and and and back to our topic of the hour that caravan I think when people turn on their television and see thousands and thousands of people waving the flags of their country demanding entry into our nation\nI maybe I'm naive maybe I don't get it but to me that is the greatest free advertising for Trump in the Republican Party that we will ever see who wants to be

or you know\nPurposely take a bath and and also it's funny when you get into the business it's harder to listen to talk radio\nBecause gee you know you sort of know what goes on it's like a filmmaker's look at movies they don't look at movies the same way you when I look at movies because they're looking at how it's been put together sort of that way for me with talk radio now but the

fact that it is coordinated and it is planned ended his organized by may use the word organized because you know organized is sort of a a a modification of the term organizer or if I may community organizer\nYou see our nation had a community organizer in chief and what we're seeing here this is what community organizing looks\nLike the the the demonstrations the moms the the screaming\nThe disruptions the a black lives matter or the uh the disruptions of the United States Senate the marches in the streets the stopping of traffic ... this is all community organizing\nAnd and I guess we should be used to it by now\nIs is is really how we want decisions made in this country based on the screaming in the streets based on\n... thousands of people demanding entry to record so we're so we're now going to change our immigration laws and accommodate these people were not going to make laws in the United states of America because thousands of people from another country\nCharge across our border and demand it\n... maybe we will have a red way [laughter] you know honestly maybe maybe\nIf they this is really their plan if they really think this is helping may maybe we'll actually ... majority in the house the Republicans will cause this is this is\nThe greatest thing I think that could happen to Republicans if they stay the course\nAnd if they follow the lead of the president who has been the you know you may disagree with his tweets you may disagree with the little language he uses you may think that he stepped on his own message sometimes you listen and and guess what I Would agree with you on hold on most of that\nBut on the policy on the actual things that this president has been able to achieve\nI don't know how a conservative Republican on the whole\nCould have an argument\nFor what this president's been able to do with the judiciary with nominations to the courts with taxes\nWith military spending with foreign policy\nEven trade I'm not a huge fan of his rhetoric on trade\nBut so far the threat of terrorists seem to have gotten results\nUh and and as far as I'm concerned we load up the terrorists against China\nThey are not our friend there are certainly not our economic friend\nSo we have Republicans could actually follow his lead on this and ... and ... and finally jump on board\nWith regard enforcing our immigration laws and drawing a
