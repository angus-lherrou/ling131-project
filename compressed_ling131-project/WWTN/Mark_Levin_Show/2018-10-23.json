{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "You know I Can't get a loan for something and you can't get along because your credit stinks\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's right\nWell I'm sitting here I've got a kid who's the toll is car or in a three car pile up here in Nashville and he's fine but uh he's got to get a new car and we're sitting there looking at stuff and I said look right you got to decide what you can't afford it and um\nWe were sitting there looking at a car that was you know it was a mid level but I mean nothing fancy or anything but it's a you know it's fairly fairly recent model\nAnd he says I think what I Need to do is go back and look at something that's a little older\nOr because I can if we wanted dependable and he wants to dependable and he has some things some options that he wants on there\nBut he says I just don't feel comfortable with that price point you know per month so let's find something a little older and something that I think that I can make the payment on 'cause he's gonna have to make the pain when they're like saying you know you don't make the payment they gonna come get it\n\n\nOh oh yeah ... is a bad thing on your credit report I see that\nYeah\nThat's right\nWell so how do we get the folks because you know again as as me as a white guy and they were trying to get people in the black community willy who called from Flint earlier will they could do he could do some proselytizing\nAnd the black community about this 'cause he's been through it I think that's what it's going to take his people saying hey man make this a priority in your life don't go out and buy stuff you can't afford to make sure that you keep your credit straight\n\n\n\nYou know I Know and and what not and it's not but you're right it's not being taught but I appreciate you going to Robin thanks thanks yeah All right Mike in Huntsville you would be up next to Mike what's up\nYeah so I I just want to let us know that just because you pay your bills on time or the other lady didn't have a good credit score we've paid off for a house early we have your credit card debt to income family late a lotta money\nUm AOL bad credit score is because we don't have any credit or any monthly credit card they'll do it on the low low loans\nWell see that's another thing if it's a it's sort of a convoluted formula do they use but yeah what did they look at is do you have access to a bunch of money like a credit card but you're not taking advantage of it they look at that as somebody being responsible and I know there are many people I didn't say cut up your credit cards and things and I'm sure there are ways around that\nBut one surefire way as they get a credit card and just spend a little bit on it and then pay off base and spend a little bit on and pay it off and they say that you could access ten thousand but you're only accessing five hundred a month and you're paying it off they see that as responsible\nYou know they do they see that as you know credit history as you don't carry a balance very balance our credit card so they don't know if I'm of the rich are not worth it\nWhat what do you have credit cards I Do what you just don't know how it off every okay everybody interest on it and they were very late\nBut you're saying that you do you I mean have you paid them all often don't use them anymore or what\nNot to use them but I Am up before you know in the ... ability cycle\nMhm and so they look at that as somebody that's a dozen that really a track record because you're not you're not doing it on ... ... exactly yep well look there are other ways to do it I mean I've had you know well I'll tell you this\nI mean one of the main things I look at it for me as American Express an American express you ... when I say you have to pay to make it now so you can float some stuff and I've floated some things before but that's a good way American Express is one of those things where\nMural looks very highly of that if you're responsible with salt amount of responsibility [noise]\nYou'll see one our ... we are in the more\nYou know if you've done costs um squeaking white board marker [noise]\nEasily one of the most

Abbott twice one and Austin wanted San Antonio he's obviously now gone down to Houston what the president was Senator Cruz\nIt's been a great day uh we've been all over the district people are fired up but I tell you early voting numbers are really high really really high they've smashed all records on I think an area that indicate that on both sides of the of the aisle if you will so we've got to do our part to get the vote turned out because if we turn out we ...\n[noise] yeah early voting in Texas has started as with other states and ladies and gentlemen if you hear me right now I really don't put this off get out there and voters and you know what the early voting was set up by the left to try and a and a change the system you can take advantage of it to go ahead and vote early\nAnd the more people who do that the better now tell us\nHow your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways Sen Cruz is raised a and it is a a you know tight and and and and hard fought but very winnable race\nOr with the support of your listeners a lot of good tax and we feel good but we feel that it's necessary for everybody to show up in order for us to when my opponent as I think you know is a a a a very liberal Democrat very liberal\nWho served in the United States Army and I think of her service but he uses that to try to claim set for somebody to claim independence is he's running an ad but there is nothing ... nothing independent about somebody who has already said he would vote to impeach Donald Trump\nWho's already said that he would undo the tax cuts\nWas already said that he would put in place that carbon tax is already said that he wants to regulate guns he wants to single payer government run health care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give them the other country and I can go down a long list but he is trying to run as a centrist and he's not\nBut I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they are seeing through Mr O'Rourke a efforts to a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\nAnd a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't they\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much ah we're seeing that both with congressmen award as well as my opponent and others are the Democrats very purposely without recruited leftists\nWho could run because they may have worn the uniform or otherwise good are wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something Margaret ... you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never as a response\nWhy would my opponent of why we're better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator to do all
