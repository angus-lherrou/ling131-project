believe that it's unbelievable ever without ever happen All right well appreciate your ticket ended things from phone call here yeah you too it's\nA [noise] I don't know I'm not seeing them nervous because none of this makes me nervous because I got\nPlenty to talk about the way from a from a job soon to be like oh I bet you wish this or I bet you wish that I mean I've gone through how many minutes raised at all I bet this good for rabbit I Will tell you this Trump it's been radio gold I Will not denied that Trump has been absolute radio gold\nAh but having said that\nI'm worried about the country I'm not worried about my gig I'm not worried about stuff to talk about I'll find stuff to talk about no matter what happens and you can imagine\nIf we've got a Democratic Congress and a Republican president is going to be plenty to talk about so from a selfish standpoint and don't misunderstand me no van Gogh listening out there\nIf I were to say for ratings what would be best for me it'd be best for me the Democrats won and took over at least a house or the Senate and then we'd have fireworks all the time people all worked up getting all upset about what the Democrats\nBut I'm worried about the country so I Want to move the country forward\nKnow probably the worst thing for me can be absolute smooth sailing in Congress where we where we get um the legislation that makes sense in Donald Trump's signs and then we move on to the next thing that could you know that that's got to be the most boring thing\nFor me but I don't care I Love boring I Want to get the job done and I think that um that's what needs to happen to see what I had been predicting year if the Republicans hang on and that's it is I think Nate Silver and\nYou know he was wrong on Hillary so I don't know how much greed and she put a name silver Nate Silver I Believe is giving the Democrats in eighty five percent chance of winning the house and like a Nineteen percent chance of winning the Senate so he thinks that the Republicans are going to retain control of the Senate and the Democrats will take over the house\nI Would love to see the Republicans take over everything\nBecause what's gonna happen is it the Republicans they're replacing our rhinos\nJeff Flake Bob Corker you know a ... some of these others out there\nYou're gonna get true Republicans in some of these open seats if the Republicans win and that means that Trump's agenda is going to go forward and here's something else too I don't want somebody in these rubber stamping everything Trump does I Want conservatives if Trump's going to go off on something that's not conservative\nLike I've scolded him on this whole infrastructure thing we got to rebuild the infrastructure there's nothing wrong with the infrastructure for one thing but the infrastructure doesn't need to be rebuilt from Washington each state has their own gas tax they can do it and just like Doug was talking about Missouri\nYou know they want to raise taxes and they're not spending the money on what they're supposed to be spending among now this is in every state\nYou can look at your gas tax in your state\nAnd if the elected officials are honest they'll tell you that it's going to things other than roads and bridges and that's the only thing your gas attacks supposed to be going to he's going to light rail it's going to bite pans is going to green ways is going to all museums it's going to all sorts of happy horse dung\nThat has no business going to if they were to spend the gas tax on what this supposed to be spending the gas tax on then there would be no problem\nIt's every state is in charge of their own infrastructure there's a federal gas tax and there's a state gas tax\nAnd uh the the federal gas tax is at the Washington and then it split up and then it sent back to the states and that's kind of a dumb thing to and I understand that and you know some of these states\nWouldn't get what they think they need and I don't know I I'm a big believer that you do a gas tax in on the state level of the state keep their own gas tax and then they can do whatever you know they can build the roads and bridges\nBut as I as I ride around anything I see crumbling around here has has user error all over it and I'm not going to go into the details about four forty but they're finally fixing that but that was just a boondoggle of stupidity\nAnd trying to put ridges and the thing and toward the thing all the pieces by the way I was in North Carolina last weekend and they've got that concrete with some of the original Senate thing at a hole in it so apparently who\nWas doing it over here has no idea what they're doing so we have to spend millions upon millions to re surface that now and I'm sure you see all that and your state\nTo a lot of its waste a lot of its misuse of the money there ain't no infrastructure problem is the stupidity problem [noise]\nAccurate mortgage wants to know

don't worry and another week or two nobody trashing law enforcement like\nThey always do like they always do\nAnd I wonder if this criminal justice reform stuff criminal justice reform they called us how the hell did this guy get out of prison\nHe's got a criminal record not as long as his right arm as long as there's less than is right on misdemeanors that one ...\n\nHow did he get out and that's just the foreign criminal justice reform we spend way too much time worrying about convicted felons or people who played the felonies and not enough time worrying about victims of crimes\nWe've spent way too much time worried about illegal aliens rather than American citizens we spend way too much time worrying about illegal alien children dreamers rather than an American citizen children\n\nWe allowed to talk about these things I mean I insist on talking about these things not the president has correctly pointed out I Know he's an avid listener to this program and I greatly appreciate it\nThat the media really have led the way with the rhetoric was\nReferences the Hitler would the references to racism anyone they disagreed with on the left and then he closed the media of course that's how they frame the issues dictators\n\nAnd there've been a number of very smart articles written today and yesterday pointing out\nHey look political rhetoric even bad\nPolitical rhetoric doesn't justify doesn't explain what a nut job like this dies and did\n\nIt simply does not I just gave you a laundry list of the crimes that he committed\nTo and through twenty fourteen Donald Trump wasn't even running for president up and to and through twenty four Cheney committed multiple felonies by that multiple felonies he was already radicalized\n\nHe didn't need Donald Trump or anybody else the push 'em over the edge you as already over the edge\n\nHe started committing crimes at least from the public record since Nineteen Ninety One all the way through twenty fourteen\n\nDoes nothing to do with Donald Trump nothing whatsoever\n\nBut the left the media that Democrats have a quote unquote registered Republican\n\nAnd Donald Trump he's driving around with what Trump and Pence

and is this the\nPrime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau trip all the old man's block\nTrudeau has set in the past say we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants from all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who were trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do\nPresident United States picks up the phone and he calls ... says hey we got seven to fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you said you're very compassionate about these things so here's where we are going to do when I get\nA whole bunch of greyhound buses and we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses\nAnd we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico does it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico oh we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses\nAnd will drive them to our northern border and won't let them out because\nThese people want to leave they hell hole say come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume or ...\nEven though they're carrying their flags\nAnd in the United states this president believes in law and order and enforcing the immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three\nThe illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving there how host Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea Mr produce\nAnd on top of that look at greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use so that's my solution ladies and gentlemen for the caravan\nHa a parade of illegal immigrants who were coming into our country\nSupported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states funding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth\nBut here we can accommodate everybody OK well use Hooper too I don't care if we can use uber use taxis greyhound whatever I'm not particular about these things [noise] while Mr producer my call screeners\nDown why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we ever live and number two if not if we have a regular American\nMike in Maryland the great WMA I'll go\nHey Martin great talking to you a caller on the ... on the war rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed that some things to push the buttons to push this guy was that\nUm you know it's the first time where the borders of a particular candidate have been directly or ... of the attack and attack regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they picked up five and then there are five\nAnd ... that's my point is you know they're going back and forth that it's the it's the rhetoric between um what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it's true it's directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrat\nI think I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nThat the political rhetoric causes these things I mean seriously ladies and gentleman this guy has a a long crime record including threatening to use a bomb and two thousand to multiple felonies\n\nAnd we get played all the time by the media really by the left more more more generally play it all the time well if the president we keep down his rent has nothing to do with the president then as I pointed out in exquisite detail for the last forty eight hours\nIt's the president who's called Hitler it's the president who's called a Nazi it's his supporters us who are called neo Nazis and racists it's the president who's called a racist and he's called a racist and a Nazi on MSNBC\nOr CNN by the late night host\nWhich is really truly appalling absolutely\nAppalling\nAnd then they tell you know we got to tone down here toned down immediately out of the ... who's responsible for CNN\nPuts out a statement without knowing anything blaming Trump\nJake Tapper such a fool he goes on the air like John Harris I think that they go on there and say what Trump

one million\nIt's one million okay that's we're operating\nHeritage a backlog of one million people understand how this works when somebody stepped foot in the country and uses magic words that the lawyers tell them they use lawyers south of the border lore is north of the border they have the system they know what the law is\nIt triggers a mechanism ... legal mechanism would they have a right to be appeared before administrative law judges and because there's so many of them they're given a date to return it often that they could be two or three years away and guess what the vast majority of them never show up\nRight now I realize that certainly my solution partial solution would be to try to in in California for example if there are shortages of attorneys you get appointed

to come back they don't have to be a ... in other words nobody adjudicate something right there you get through to assemble your evidence and make your arguments and so forth and so on so they're not going to adjudicate them right there\n... unbelievable look at the process\nAnd the president has been begging Congress trying to change the system to prevent this and of course the Democrats refused\nSo we will never be able to to eliminate that you know in backlog you're talking about\nYou know the million backlog is one day going to become a two million backlog and this backlog that I talk about again these people are gone there's somewhere in our country we don't know where they live\nIn some cases they get false names have have false IDs\nIt becomes impossible\nIt becomes about
