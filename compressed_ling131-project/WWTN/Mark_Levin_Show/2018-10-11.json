Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast\nAnd ... the the good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also and never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federal is she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Capitol hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and happened over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nDo you remember the mobs on the campuses at UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire and the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involved marshmallows and small cars\nIn the more the words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob all going to allow our our totally a mop it is without\nA doubt that there's no other where now it's going to put a stop or what ... what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August sick out ...\nAnd that's all I thought she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often deliver you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I'm Tucker Carlson Shannon bring a lot a Stewart Bernie and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob were ... jump right on it and then she had a rich joined her she had her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if I had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist\n... which was a mob or the antifa mob which was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville [noise]\nUh but he did not do that and the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left or my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these ads mostly peaceful\nIn the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests abducted ah in the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe ... Lewis what is that right yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly\nPeaceful that was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nTo do what we saw chasing it went right what about the people\nWho were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or is that a lot I think it's ...\nYeah and if there weren't any party as we call it um out for ... come out but they serious\nYeah so that's married after and ham jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual Brooklyn actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was gonna get pushed back she didn't have another originally under the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville sign of what\nA and then she goes on to say if you can play that are real fast Richard\nLennie Lennie Lennie will pass the N. word because I feel like that as part of the weaponization of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word as mob and he ... he now says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized\nSaying that word against Democrats against the law you know\nWhat you really can't tell\nFedEx delivery passion what we term at her by delivering\nOur veterans who were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life [noise] let them know you can join me as a pro supporter of our veterans Hi this is Joe Montana and on the one hundredth anniversary of Veterans Day help no vet alone improve the lives of those who have served our country\nPlease show your support and text V.

you've seen on ... and this angry left wing mob mob since the middle of his campaign or they really the leadership of the Democratic party actually do believe\nThat you are the most dangerous people in this country because you're calling them out on their agenda you're actually keeping them from power and now they think that they could intimidate you\nThey actually think that they can bully their

our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it ... this is their base they have decided that there is more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob\nThat's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians they got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets thinking that\nThey knew what was going to happen they are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and

Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs\nDemocrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate even if no senator as opposed to understand this\nBut Democrats care about the environment so Trump domination Jeffrey boss or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed it to come to the floor for a vote they\nSay that every single one of the nominees the Trump has put for remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the ambassador you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy he was the ambassador of Germany he languished without a vote for over a year we had no one doubts that are in Germany\nAnd once he got there boy he is is ripped that continent into shape not just Germany he has been that the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nIn Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry is suddenly doing business with the terrorists mullahs Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get Rick right now as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that's what Trump one way it's because they didn't have as ambassador there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed cloture this is a Senate rule that can be changed and should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator Foust cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate nothing about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now\nThat are languishing for each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want a slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nThe going back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's so here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years twelve\n\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\n\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirmed more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nInstead he's now saying hey it's a nice mid term election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\n\nHey Joe mansion I Know it's it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from D.
