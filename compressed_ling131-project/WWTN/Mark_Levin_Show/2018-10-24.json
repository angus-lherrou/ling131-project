be buying any of those and that's why I have long advocated a law\nAnd this would have to be state to state obviously but the law is is if you're on welfare and you win the lottery the lottery money goes back to the state so you ain't got a chance of winning\nAnd you know it's going to be hard to hide that you're on welfare once you win this thing they go do a double check and go oh well you're on government assistance so thank you will take that lottery tickets remote so does you know good once you do that the poor folks out there that are on welfare will stop buying lottery tickets\nIf you win the state get your money because you're living off the state you got to pay them back first\nAnd so that's what I Would do I wonder if anybody's ever even thought about doing that as you see they

strategy is stoking fears about immigration\nThere you go this is also an attack on New Year's eve because you're so stupid\nThat\nPresident he's able to cause you to be\nFearful and scared you're so stupid you can't process what's actually taking place and besides it totally zero point zero six percent of all undocumented people already in this country and the irony is that there's so many

time on the today show that would be NBC had to newscasters cut three go\nYes you're right I mean what's striking here as the economy is strong employment is low but instead of talking about his achievements these days the president really is leaning into this message for free and I'll just\nFear stop this is another journalist\nSo instead of talking about the economy which of course the media never talk about instead of talking about the economy which the media could care less about the president is stoking he's a he's leaning into his message of fear not law and order remind you\nOf

motivating you because you see ladies and gentleman unless you are absolutely emotionally out of your mind you're not going\nTo vote you're not going to vote\nAnd yet is not immigration a key issue is not an important issue it may not be an important issue\nTo phony journalists to phony anchors to phony host a phony reporters but it is an important issue to men and women who go to work every day try to raise their families and live in communities that are exposed to this\nIt is the people who break their ass everyday paying their property taxes and in some states where we have income taxes most states and so much of that money goes to individuals who are here illegally\n\nIt matters to people who are construction workers it matters to people who are truck drivers in taxi drivers it matters that people who work with their hands\nMany people who work with their hands none of these reporters work with their hands at least not above the table\nGo ahead Democrats from winning back

Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala and other countries not race baiting their identify\n\nRace baiting is what we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings by the left the Democrats and the media go

will spear no expense so\nUh we'll see what happens with this I was as I've said at the outset of this hour in this show today I Would think this would be pretty easy thing for the bee ATF and the secret service than the rest of and you got unexploded bombs\nAnd you can't just by these at your local hardware store\nI mean these are things that you have to put together and I would think that they're in short order we're going to find out who did this I wouldn't be real curious to see because I have my theory is I'm well you have your theory and if it turns out to be some crazed Trump supporter in America had\nThen we condemn that as well I condemn it already of who no matter who it is\nBut it just seems too coincidental I guess right here before the election it just seems too obvious to me I mean ... if you're a Trump supporter and you're I don't know I mean I ...\nI suppose you could get so upset that you'd want to kill George Soros with George Soros and the Clintons and Obama and\nMaxine Waters and Debbie what's her name Schultz and who else out there I mean they're sending sending these bombs all over the place yeah I'm sure a price Chuck Schumer didn't get one it\nJust I mean it's it seems like um it almost seems cliche doesn't it is I'm going to\nKill these folks you know I'm a I'm a right wing terrorists so I'm going to be or this is my list and it's Obama and it's the Clintons in his George Soros and its Maxine Waters in his Debbie what's hurting shields and it just seems rather odd\nNow as I said it could be well turn out to be some guy in the ... that doesn't mean that everybody in America had as a terrorist but that's exactly the way the left wing media is going to portray this as a matter of fact there are already starting to portray it this way they are talking about Trump's rhetoric\nMatter I was looking at Twitter and you know and sometimes you wish you hadn't but there's a lot of stuff out there about this today no matter of fact
