today\nFolks this is not a bad thing\nNow all of a sudden the Democrats that they have lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court they thought they'd have\nA six three majority with the president Hillary Clinton right out and ...\nDidn't quite work out that way now that it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than Anthony Kennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\nThe liberals are now attacking the courts now listen attacking\nAn institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but her which makes a really good point here folks liberals for years how about a really hard time doing one thing\nThey can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think about it now\nI'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen but the big ticket items that liberals on abortion on demand Bob yeah a basic income\nMedicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals\nThey have no national mandate for\nThey wanted a national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand on it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\nAs a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items of why it's very simple when you think about it it is a very simple mathematical equation\nYou want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in a presidential election to vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges in a black robe consider themselves swing voters to do\nIt for you the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the fees and you're just get a bunch of\nLiberals pretending to be judges on the court you choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do the hard work\nOf knocking on doors getting elected in telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn deal V. a a DMV excuse me or whatever the deal for years they can't run that either they convincing them that

do their national pastime is Jen you fly thing before the author of big government at whatever means they have to use the get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is this the
