bomber so that's that's where they're going with this folks today this is the ... bomber\nBoomers resist Trump put up this this mega bomber is an example of a\nTerrorism but simply when someone publicly demonized as a person or group it can result in the incitement to violence leg\nWhich is statistically probable but who specifics cannot be predicted exactly\nWhat are they going to say the same thing about Maxine Waters and the rest of these folks when the idiot shows up and start trying to gun down Republican congressmen and senators and hit Steve ... is that because of Maxine Waters\nCrank a rose Nikki Trump this caravan is bringing crime violence and even terrorism well that settles then this caravan is composed of nothing but Donald Trump supporters hash tag mega bummer\nI so I Know\nThe Tasha Roswell says Donald Trump you and your hateful rhetoric are responsible for the mega bummer\nAnd it goes on and on like this mail bomb sent the CNN et cetera wrapped in ISIS flag ISIS bomber hashtag ISIS bummer so why is hashtags mega bomber trending on Twitter without so much as a shred of evidence that is a good question\nAnd so they look at this and it's wrapped in um one of these bombs they say is wrapped in an ISIS flag so could this be ISIS\nWho knows who it is I Would think if there were ISIS one of them would have gone off\nThat's why I'm this is why it's so suspicious to me\nBecause it's again let me just walk this through for you if you are a crazed Trump supporter and you think that George Soros\nAnd Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton and uh Brock Obama and Maxine Waters and Debbie what's the name Scholten CNN or the devil incarnate\nDon't you think one of the bombs would've exploded\nI'm just saying they all show up and not one of mixed loads it it sounds like to me it's somebody trying to draw sympathy for these people not somebody who's trying to kill them if they were trying to kill them\nAnd I again I'm not making a suggestion but Maxine Waters would be pretty easy to take out\nI mean she's at rallies all the time I mean somebody you know somebody could show I mean what any of these folks on the right or left\nYou show up at a rally and you started shooting from the back of the room I mean nobody's checking anything is Maxine Waters rallying for crying out loud none of people there to watch the secret service with metal detectors and the rest of it she shows up at a town hall meeting somewhere in California somebody could take I'm not look again I'd please\nDon't anybody misunderstand I'm just saying if you're going to kill Maxine Waters this will be the hardest way to do it\nTo send a bomb to her office that you know is going to be looked at offsite and found before it ever gets to her office you know it's never going to get to her office you know it's never going to get the Debbie Wasserman Schultz is office you know it's never going to get to Obama\nOr Hillary they all have offsite male facilities that screen for this stuff from the secret service so you know it's never going to make it to their house\nSo why would you send something in the mail like then\nUnless you're trying to generate some sympathy and get the left ginned up for the election say look these crazy mega had folks are out there and the magnet bombers on the loose and we can rest and before too long they'll be blaming it on Trump himself he was devising this in the basement of the White House you know\nGive me some more see for [noise] where's my Dempsey for [laughter]\nThat's good I mean they're all but doing that now there and stop playing with a ...\n[laughter] a is\nGive me a short fuse like me so yeah I mean you look at these things and now we got ISIS markings on these things and who knows where they came from\nBut I'm just telling you if this were a professional that really wanted to kill these folks this is the least likely way to do it but it's the most likely way to get a bunch of attention and get people all upset and gender up against the\nPresident because of his rhetoric I'm just saying again we'll see 'cause I Would ... ... how many ... people and make bets on how long it takes the secret

of the media downplayed same with black lives matter downplayed\n\nAnd I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such closer to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as possible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded\nSo they have these are these packages and these devices are in their ah original form\n\nWill make it much easier for them to track down ... they'll get the guy or gal the guys are ...\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience with the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now and they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then they they're able to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of it\nThat's all we know we don't know their motives we don't know their motives\nWell we know the motive uh obviously is the threatened if not harm if not killed the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why can't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see the crescendo building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question faces death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him is it because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about him or Steve ... says about him\n\nThe other day the president said or rallies in a rally I think it was used in a says he's at nationalist well I'm not a naturalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\n\nAnd they try to tie it to not see is up or the ... or ... these this is in the media national\nSocialist party notice when people bring climate there socialists they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist socialist right\nThey didn't say that about Bernie Sanders hey he's using Nazi language he's using Stalin his language\nNo of course not\nMost of the media in this country they revealed themselves so for them now the sit back for the most radical among them on cable TV on MSNBC on CNN for the most radical among them on the today show or good morning America\nFor the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump what absolutely nothing to do it this is really just further evidence of how outrageous they are\n\nThe person or people who are responsible for this are responsible for this\nAre responsible for this\nDo you think the media in this country over the last two years have been responsible you think the media in this country over the last few years have been measured\nYou'd think the media in this country many in the media in this country cross the line with their references to Hitler Stalin and racism and all the rest of it\n\nDo you think Joe Scarborough was cross the line or make a ... or Don Lemon or Chris Cuomo on the list goes on and on you think they cross the line with their heated rhetoric what their point something language\n\nAnd now\nThey're going to tell you [noise] calm down stop the

and fifty eight family units these are ...\nNuclear families were caught between the point of entry in September a new record and he's sharp spike from the previous months into the one hundred sixty one thousand and I love and one hundred and Thirteen family units were apprehended this year remember\nOnly one point four percent of the family units apprehended last year were deported so much all of them remain in our communities along with the nearly half a million others who are never apprehended and this is growing every year so now we've gotten to almost seven hundred thousand\nAnd it goes\nOh this is an incredibly serious matter of course national\nSovereignty the rule of law or the nature of our immigration system it's being openly embrace him we violated and not just by aliens\nBy people in our own country like people in our own country now\nWe spend a lot of time last night it's been picked up by a lot of news outlets a conservative news outlets since today as we have in the past on this issue pointing out the hypocrisy of the Democrats Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Brock Obama\nBernie Sanders Chuck Schumer and many others Harry Reid the positions that they took ten years ago Fifteen Years ago twenty five years ago the positions that they took\nOn a legal immigration first of all they called them illegal immigrants\nAs recently as two thousand nine twenty ten Chuck Schumer called them illegal immigrants as a matter of fact he admonished his audience in two thousand nine he said look\nIf you don't use the word illegal then you lose essentially the moral high ground what is this undocumented stuffy said now of course he's reversed course because they're all about power politics not about country\nSo what's the point the point is the Democratic party is not even the Democratic party of ten years ago\nIt's certainly not the Democrat Party Twenty years ago its position on immigration like its position on economics like its position in the military like its position on healthcare embraces increasingly radical policies in attitudes\nAnd it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse if the media really want to understand that division in this country they need only look at themselves and look at the course of the Democratic party has taken\nYou've a party where John Kennedy couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party where Bill Clinton couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party that wouldn't nominate Harry Truman for the presidency today and I could go down the list\nAnd so now you have individuals who won out radical each other\nTell me who is a centrist and the Democrat leadership\nVoice so called moderate can you name one just name one\nWell I Can't name any I

should I\nYeah and I you know I come from a very democratic family I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania where my family recall minors and uh the Democratic party really look out for the working class they don't anymore if the Democrats have completely gone so far left that they don't care about the the working class in\nIn America anymore and you know the biggest thing that bugs me I Want the wall but I think the biggest thing that could be done is it's both sides it's it's if if you really enforced e verify it\nAnd you didn't want to these people and he said okay every illegal alien that you hire or going to find you ten thousand dollars a week\nAnd and I think Trump was behind that and if I'm not mistaken that was brought up during this whole dreamer thing\nWell give me another one why
