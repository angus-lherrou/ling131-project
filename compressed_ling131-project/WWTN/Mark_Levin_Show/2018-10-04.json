a massive story Fifteen thousand words that's like three chapters in a typical book on Fred Trump's taxes and tax returns going back to the early to thousands\nWhat did they get that information\nWhere did they get that information just as a civil liberties union we're forced to file federal income taxes we're forced to file death taxes we have no choice we have to give it to the IRS and state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages they went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages that boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard\nCopy as opposed to a a electronically and provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office the attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue so what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and has the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great wealth you've never seen that peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\nOr\nAny of these multi billionaire families with a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nKnow severe familiar with New York city aren't you all those buildings with the president's name on he created this\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\nThey want you to believe that Donald Trump\nIs a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and but for his father he couldn't succeed\nThey're so concerned about that and they go on about how he he's a tax treat first of all as I understood it these were his father's tax returns\nBut why is he attacks cheat has he been adjudicated attacks she now has he been adjudicated attack street administratively or judicial you know\nNobody has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually follow your own tax returns you hire professionals and you sign the tax return and you submit it\nAnd of course the goal is to pay as little taxes as possible\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted as used underwear member that Mr ...\n\nBut there's never been a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this the wheeling and dealing they haven't built a damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the country with the Clintons name on it now what do they do to make a hundred and fifty million dollars\nDid they pay their taxes\nHow about all these foreign speeches that they influenced the Clintons particularly when she was secretary of state or a senator\n\nIn New York Times doesn't care anymore than the New York times doesn't care that Hillary Clinton violated the Espionage Act multiple times or Bill Clinton rape Juanita Broderick and been molested so many other women now it's the me too movement\nIt's interesting isn't it it's the me too movement except when it comes to Keith Ellison and John Conyers remember Joe Scarborough defending John Conyers despite what was coming up\n\nSort of this big article and everybody just keeps regurgitate it everybody just keeps repeating out of the New York times because the New York times is always right don't you know\nThe New York times is never wrong\nWe're about the economy of the mayor of a New York city they went to recoup any money that Donald Trump owes the people of New York that's what he says\nDonald Trump created thousands and thousands of jobs in New York both directly in his buildings in indirectly through suppliers\nLet's not the way communist like\nIt's not the way they think at all\nSo which Trump supposed to do go through a Fifteen thousand word document and respond if one after another after another of course not and the New York times knows he's not going to do it\n\nBut who you're going to believe the Trump family or the New York times\nI've talked about this many times I had before me an article that appeared this is just one of many on April Eighteen twenty Thirteen and the Daily Beast\n\nBetween Nineteen thirty nine in Nineteen forty five the New York times published more than twenty three thousand front page stories\nOf those eleven thousand five hundred were about World War two twenty six were about the Holocaust\nTwenty six\nSo why did the paper of record which president Franklin Delano Roosevelt is said to have come through every morning decided to bury the bulk of the Holocaust coverage deep inside the newspaper nestled between the advertisements\n\nWhy did they do that\nBut why do the media
