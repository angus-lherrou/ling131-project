I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault\nSomewhere in their life they absolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do the right candidate I Am one hundred percent certain he was Brett Kavanaugh\nNot trying to effectively ruin that man's life his family's life how evil do you have to do that so I don't care\nIf she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did and it's important once again and we don't just wide off because break out I was going to make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored because there will be others\nWe end up toward him the biggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know know Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs seats and I'm not trying to rub it in either I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't joke develop because I mean just\nWhy you know not and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on a ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise then we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are now a couple of things are just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\nIt really has been that kind of a wake has that that kind of a couple of weeks to kind of three months\nI mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and and understand what Kavanaugh's been through an emotionally doesn't know it was kind of feel like we were through another election here this whole cabinet thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... ah yourself for different\nI don't want to show my home station W.

because I Know a little bit of a a generational thing here I mean we're talking there are probably like Thirteen Years old but uh yeah flea market Montgomery ... mini mall living rooms bedrooms dine that's oh yeah you know you can find that marking the saddest thing about flea market Montgomery\nIs that it went down during the recession was that was maybe one of the saddest moments during the entire great recession anyway are now in this great economy we can have new flea market Montgomery isn't there'll be a there'll be bigger there'll be beautiful or they will have a doors and then the walls I just\nUh by the way I Am by month for the great one more to live in and ah get to some of your calls here and just mom and by the way the the phone lines are not to be confused with the uh\nThe Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line which also has been known to have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just to go straight to the FBI place\nNow um right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career it is the single most common question I have a receipt and [noise] the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone if they tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem they most people in this is true conservatives to by the way it's not like this is unique to liberal is there a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time but that in other words\nAt most seven percent of this country was even persuadable Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you did it all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy so if you want to be persuasive\nThe first thing find the right people people are open to information not the loudest\nPeople who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make just by lack humid because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to except for that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent\nOf the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information they're just going to view you as someone who is highly political trying that can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable\nOr is that they are analytical and that they genuinely are inquisitive and looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link there the millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I closing in on being legal\nTo drink the youngest one's ... eldest one's like thirty five thirty six now and I have not blame them ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age\nAnd the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this cabinet situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of the sexual assault mean that'd be awful right yeah it'd be pretty bad\nDo you have

given that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nI took informed Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe mansion Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I'm humid\nOr a seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe our after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something that's interesting that\nDeveloped out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no you did not want to end debate and again if debate tonight\nAnd today basically Kevin I Would have been dead they would have been it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical to with her voting no uh you know she has come under heat from her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been going about it not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office or with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have an ... year the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision that the Supreme Court that would stand for all Africans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering\nHas taken a look at the most likely outcome here or it looks like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positive that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nHave known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know that they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty and Spartacus but didn't you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabinet ...\nOr ... that man what he has been through and and having a backbone of steel to see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nMetal ultimately what I think Brecht cabinet as role is two fold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged and paying attention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model and we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce their kids to somebody\nThat seems to have all the right for priorities in the right places they just the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nThe folks have learned about how this and it actually works and that's important from the point of civic says well how deliberative the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nApproximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYou know there are a lot of things about our government we complained about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by but they're always

person for the court all this time and this ... ... for me with is the station it is all it is as hard choice probably as close to call all of any that I can ever remember\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncumbent president's party loses generally in fact there's only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifty is\nThat the incumbent presidents party has actually gain seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point in American history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had\nThe bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans bunch and boy American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush in the wake of nine eleven\nSo it took the great depression nine eleven\nAnd the botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in a midterm cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house is just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate maps favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was likely to be a no vote\nAbout ten points about ten points with the what's the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already in danger there Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia the voted yes Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on back of this\nAgain when I've been taking a look information on how much this vote meant in those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump\nBroke Kavanaugh states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to say but still the house you take a walk in if you check any of the polls he checked decides to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pacing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nAnd my question is and this is what I'm working on because again I base everything off of information or we add an inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that it now I guess to what we went through in any of those other examples\nNot\nThe great depression not after nine eleven\nBut if you're looking for a company absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy to what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton\nBut then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they've made him the issue right we've had the ... we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house I could be analogous you throw cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs this that moment of dawned an inflection point in American history where things are different historically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year\nBut there was an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue the

Anchorage, Alaska\nAnd and then he understand that uh you're a you're a little higher on Lindsey than non Susan at this point\nWell just from the standpoint Brian of a senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it wasn't on the for the Senate then have all the trappings\nBut Lindsay lane those other members on that Judiciary Committee eighty eight there spinach okay exactly what they needed the hair I don't think they pay attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait to see which way the wind was blowing\nThat's kind of way I look at it

needed to be said to those memories of that and Judiciary Committee there were acting uh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think\nBut but actually something you can be proud of but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham's by this moment as well are you talking about the the five o'clock hour five o'clock eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote and it was ... eastern time but Lindsey Graham\nA week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where it's better now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him in ... in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be pragmatic yet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately\nTake anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take I'd given that

indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back those comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although it should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the

the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron does scientist for governor for years after endorsing Democrat right\nElectric from the store a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor for ... years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyway there are a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently as a Democrat but it is a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway so I thought my he actually was a Republican governor in in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the party what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement of dissent is the PBA\nStudents said dissent is would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote\nThe men and women of law enforcement want to tell for the ... that Iran does say that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years some of the quote\nFrom the president of the border police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the\nBlood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to\nThis pose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sudden signal he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nBy morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mothers that their children in the car\nBut you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over and part of what made me so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look in and I was tracking violence towards police officers remember\nBefore the whole Kaepernick thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly theories that I Do here in South Florida that tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as a journalist\nWho has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police as a result of the place being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance\nBut here's what's real in this story\nRemember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor endorsing Rhonda saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three\nTo say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed\nThree forty killed and until this week\nWe had ... and this is the audacity of this person writing this article informed about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers dine line duty afforded than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nWhen he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Ford of police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement would then kicked to the curb by special interest groups by media by politicians\nAnd it's exactly why I started a series that I did a couple years ago and in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now but I didn't put in that position\nYeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop to hunt get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a bad apple\nBut almost every one of all good people put their lives on the line every single day for us and it is our responsibility now more than ever to back the badge and spread the word\nIs not getting better it's gotten worse where this kind of crap that's going on and media if we don't want to have good folks that want to be police officers that put on the badge that leave their families and by the way just this year\nWe had Seventy widows Seventy widows Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've got more than a hundred children that have lost a parent\nIn the line of duty stories are never told\nBut if we don't have great folks to pick
