praying James is on my list every morning and I look at them and praying for I've been praying for his heart and I've been praying for him to um called back so I'm\nIn the fall in that um [noise] I mean James who's been through hell and a lot of guys out there that have gone through it in it\nSo understandable that he gets to a point where he's like you know what evil ... wins out and he talked about I says man he's talked about when you've been touched by evil yeah touched by evil and he remembers the time it touched them\n[noise] and uh and it did it changed his life but the problem is in the strictures ... fast Seventeen is that for anybody in Christ is a new\nCreation the old has passed away the whole the news has come\nIn natural man that's hard and it's it's real hard\nI mean it's easy to say that to James it's another thing to watch that play out but that's the problem is and we can't give up on that promise not even for James but most guys struggle with that and Jane just struggle with it and a and a deep deep level but guys in the spectrum\nOf of wound whether it be a father wound a mother wound or an abusive wound whatever that is\nThere's so many guys out there I think you know what ... it's too far gone God can't touch me God can't free means so we box the ... and the power of the God of all creation in and we don't think he can touch that spot where evil touched\nYeah I agree Scott I mean his stories so powerful I think could help a lot of people I think I'm\nBlessed the promises that scripture reading yeah that's what it says yeah it was it gets comforted he shares that helps those the ...\nThe most important thing is just you know one minute and then he called back and you know you need somebody in\nThat's where we are called to do so or hope James you know we got when I randomly and make sure we have this number and we do and\nI'm reach out to mention one other thing you judge just pertaining to that not only you know it's a real issue with guys not only wound can God really he'll just wound\nA Kenny really bring healing can you bring comfort in in free me from that um but it also plays out\nIn this idea of sin we sent ass in Houston and some others repeats and over and over and over again some sense\nIn our mind we just think are just too far gone in no God wouldn't free is from that he wouldn't forgive us there and you know we again we limit\nThe ... and the power but we also limit the love of God and we think we can out sin is love and in turn outs in his grace\nBut God can forgive and we've got to be reminded of the story of king David is king David yes he's the man after God's own heart but he messed up\nHe cheated on his wife with ... he's the one that sent her husband to the front line to die which is murder\nScott gyms are sitting here going I was a kid I didn't send now yeah I was abused right off live this life of this you know that I've had to live with the rest of my life yeah forty years James has been dealing with this\nAnd I think the point is is is each day is harder and harder to get out of the pet mhm and areas like math I started smoking I don't I'm I'm just doing numbers are not accurate but\nProbably forty years he's been smoking has been doing this for forty years you said he started smoking after the incident as a young kid you know that that's what he had to turn to the same adding that make it to the day you know listening to make it through another day any sink in Houston and on why\nGod why me as a kid you know the thing is intriguing and it's interesting as we always go to God and not understand there's another force out there and he mentioned the force you said the word yeah you know and um\nYou know that I think that's a lot of times that people have a hard time going will this happened to me [laughter]\nAnd um he's walk without a long time and I'm and I'm hoping that each time he's thought about calling us and that is that I mean you sound a totally different conversation this time right\nYeah and last time yeah there's a lot of emotion last time you know or even kill system\nAnd maybe this is a step maybe it's a step closer to freedom I I I started to show saying\nI Can't I think Jim didn't take his life back [laughter] I don't know how much\nHow you know he said Jesus can correct yeah we got one ... spirit we're going to want to yeah porn spirit and he's there yeah and so the with Matthew five says is that when you're poor and spirit you get to a point to where you mourn and then the next blessing there is me\nIt leads to meet in a sense of where James is that now he's porn spirit he's morning that the maintenance is turning from you\nWho can't in turning to the God who can and it's huge is huge and there is a blessing there and so if he would turn to the guy who can shows meeting is here in ... that was done in blessing\nEverybody's got to count on six one five seven three seven nine nine eight six seven three

sure you've encouraged a lot of people to not let you go\nPatio I just think you are going to cut you off we got a minute or two but your stories powerful you pray to God freedom yeah\nYou've got to God I Can't do it that's the first thing you've got to do is you got to admit that we can't lawyers and you weren't yeah there was a porn spirit and you turn it over to him yeah you know and got to say you know got is the giver and take her advice but he's given you live and thirty eight years of age\nAnd it's pretty amazing but you know in a couple of things there uh I think you're right on the prayer it I think it changed my desire or protect me for myself those are very powerful prayers to say to God and he'll do it you know the real challenge I have is you know I think a a a is good\nBut it it's not the final answer it can only take you so far because one thing I Would challenge patio and I am I'm great this huge thirty eight years sober\nA but the gods she's talking to doesn't call her an alcoholic anymore you know I was addicted to pornography I don't wake up every day and I am a pornographic you know neither\nA world identifying you yeah that's right into identify myself as a child of God\nWho is set free and set pretty I'm In new creation and Christ and Patty even talked about that her husband looked at her and said this isn't the same person there's a new creation there and so we got to be careful\nBecause if I wake up every day in label myself something I'm going to have a tendency to lean\nTowards that label fulfill that where God wants you to be free from that label and he wants you to have the true identity that is found in him and he wants you to disregard that label and so that's where I think you know a and in a in some of these things alters they yeah they talk about the higher\nPower but there's only one through higher power and fifth not Jesus in a in a higher power it's a false higher power and it's not going to set you free\nNow because of giving all this political correct yeah our barge rhino what's God we know that he's the source\nAnd she even before she even went to those meetings and she went she turned to God yeah right yeah and um I Know she said she's not a religious person will let you go to church and we want to encourage her to go to church but it sounds like she is a child of God is that the patio and encouraging stop labeling yourself an alcoholic you know\nYou start labeling yourself the train Ottawa yeah deemed child ... yeah nutrition that's why I've played that song at the end but I Am a child no longer a slave to send ... alcohol is a sense you know whatever\nYou know what I mean we're all addicts are all addicted to sin you know you know God is one that he's the one that he'll just from it transforms her heart but I Want to get this I Want James understand this James your story got Patty to call got caffeine to call\nYou have a powerful story how do you have a powerful story you need to share your story but James we need to change your heart God needs to change your heart just like how do you\nGot for give me my since I Need you I Can't make it another day without you that's what I Want you to

man every day we wake up and we walked in spirit we walk in the flesh and so there's a struggle they choose the spirit we walk in the freedom and we resist the flash and it's a struggle but we have the power to win the struggles\nAnd the power and to me and my prayer for everybody to this week is to recognize and experienced that freedom [noise]\nYou know in the show no the truth and the truth

that was ... who else knew what he would he was saying the things he was saying and and by the way he hated Donald Trump because Trump was a great\nFriend of Israel and Bowers also had a Trump because Trump is the only American president in history they're Jewish grandchildren his daughter Ivanka has become an observant Jew her husband Jared Kushner\nIs a ah Orthodox Jews the children the president's children are Jews the ...\nThen it has attended many Jewish religious functions is I have and so this guy who ah hates Jews and wanted to kill Jews mentally ill no criminal past his neighbor said it was a great guy always very friendly\nAnd went after Trump for loving Jews is now Trump is being attacked by the mainstream media in Washington Post for somehow causing directly or indirectly the murder of Jews\nWhen Trump is their best friend Israel and the Jewish people I've ever had\nA few hours ago Sarah Sanders put out a choice presidential press secretary quote is there any\nTragedy the Washington Post were not exploit to attack President Trump the evil act of anti Semitism in Pittsburgh\nWas committed by a coward who hated President Trump because President Trump is an unapologetic defender of the Jewish community and the state of Israel so oh one headline Saturday yesterday in the Washington Post said bomb suspect found an inspiration and Trump\nSo the media is saying that ... was encouraging incentivized by Trump to put out a fourteen bombs simulating the killing of two ex presidents and twelve other a notable Americans\nSo that the president's being tried to assassination attempts and the murder of Jews\nNot by some far left wing\nWebsite is filled with hate but by CNN by MSNBC and by the Washington Post that are supposedly mainstream objective news sources which of course they're not in fact on the day that CNN received\nThe photo bomb in the mail from ... the New York times ran a progressive fiction depicting the secret service itself assassinating President Trump with Russian help\nIt's unbelievable on that day and in fact CNN's parent company Time Warner as you may know what's a co sponsor of the play in Washington park that simulated the stabbing the murder\nOf the president last June performing Shakespeare's chili Caesar\nAnd they had an actor playing Caesar dressed up like Trump he was stabbed to death each time and the performance\nAnd uh one of the sponsors of that was the parent company of CNN\nNow can you imagine the reaction if say the summer of twenty Fifteen that one of the parent company of Fox News had a play in Central Park that simulated the stabbing the vicious murder upper Iraq Hussein Obama I Want to know\nThe media reaction to that event but the parent company of CNN paid money to sponsor she Julius Caesar's Julius Caesar that had the an actor playing Caesar dressed as Trump being stabbed to death\nIn fact after James Hodgkinson attempt to the masses fascination\nOf Republican members of Congress resulting in a mortar wounds to Stephen skill lease\nThe Washington Post the next day\nRan a story about stirring up violence focusing on right wing talk radio even though Hodgkinson was a supporter an advocate of a Bernie Sanders\nAnd also posted many complimentary things about Rachel Maddow so instead of focusing on the fact Hodgkinson actually traveled hundreds of miles\nTo the cap and take the leadership of the house of representatives and he was a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter\nOf frequent viewer of MSNBC\nThe Washington Post ran a story about violence third up by right wing talk radio over the last several weeks much like the ah the photo bomb sent to about fourteen people\nThere have been at least twenty examples of left wing or sending envelopes filled with white powder for many many Republicans in fact all Republicans\nPeople like ... defense James Mattis the president himself the vice president all the adult children of a President Trump have received in the mail\nEnvelopes containing white powder simulating rice and\nIn fact the the the rice in like substance was sent to the home of Senator Susan Collins after she voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh so all this is going on for weeks and weeks and weeks and the media largely did not cover it because all of the news that fits they print\nAnd if that doesn't fit and then they don't print it\nIf there is a political violence committed by James Hodgkinson of Illinois they blame conservative right wing talk radio\nOf course we know about Ted Cruz an IT cruise chased out to restaurants and also when Senator McConnell was having dinner in a ... restaurant\nA Democrat grabbed his food and threw it in the street or the diners came to the assistance of Senator McConnell\nWho's a survivor of polio ... and his wife who's in the cabinet and the media doesn't want to call those actions a mob in fact one CNN anchor Burke Baldwin and Don Lemon chastised Republicans for using the quote an word one other example\nWhenever a white nationalist they got the right to do it but I Wish they would march in the street progressive activist\nCover the words they expressed as violence\nBut win largely violent leftist ... and other progressive groups commit acts of violence causing thousands of dollars worth of damage on college campuses the media never covers it that way at all and so this is a long history\nOf radical leftist and some on the right\nCommitting acts of violence that is covered it completely differently by the objective mainstream media the worst in my opinion is Time Warner the parent company of CNN providing money to sponsor a Shakespeare play Julius Caesar\nWhen the main actors dressed up his trumpet he stabbed to death and people applaud in fact when Louis ... Louis Farrakhan the left wing nation of Islam began the anti Semite set a large rally\nThat Jews are termites in thousands in attendance applauded and cheered calling juice termites\nThat is the same person Louis Farrakhan where President Bill Clinton and Brock Hussein Obama stood next to head pictures taken with\nAt the funeral of Aretha Franklin and in fact a Obama had the political sense to know when he ran for the presidency and overweight\nNot to allow the public to know that it was a friend of Louis Farrakhan they ran around together in Chicago and that that's the classic anti Semite that the media completely ignored the relationship between Farrah Khan and Obama because it was bad politically so this whole thing disgusts me\nI Hope soon\nVery soon but a few hours is killed either a by lethal injection beheading electric chair shooting whatever it takes powers has got to go the way it tempered thing ... McVeigh for violence and Bowers was a Trump hater\nBut the Washington Post has somehow implicitly tied Trump to the murder\nOf God's loving eleven Jews yesterday morning in Pittsburgh the whole thing is disgusting when you get your reaction plus we're gonna have later on David Wray fair to talk about what's happening on the southern border\nIs anyone thought about the public health crisis\nCaused by thousands of immigrants without vaccinations flooding into the southern border with type ... measles whooping cough aids pie or re diarrhea gonorrhea in the health crisis cause anyone think about that\nBut David Wray has has a fair so let's take some calls we have three lines open to be a call now eight six six six or seven seven three three seven eight six six six or seven seven three three Seventy Drudge Report tonight as a bunch of headlines about the country coming apart\nDon't have to look like your dad because this isn't your dad's hair loss treatment\nAll over the country trust bosley because they're ahead of the curve\nThey use the latest technology to give you your real hair back\nBosley permanent solution is protected by the bosley guarantee\nLet them show you for free how awesome your hair could look with an absolutely free information kit\nAnd a gift card for two hundred and fifty dollars off\nText easy for four to eight five eight five zero ask about the bosley guarantee\nE.
