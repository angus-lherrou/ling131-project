{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Up any pretense that we're journalists it's time to take the gloves off we got to make sure this guy doesn't become president ruin\nAnd a lot of these news outlets followed what\nWas that we had just a few ... a few was several weeks ago whatever was when they all got on the bandwagon oh yeah yeah yeah the\nTrump says that the ah the media are the enemy of the people and they never said such a thing he said the fake news is the enemy of the people you notice he doesn't\nCall Fox News the enemy of the people he doesn't call the Daily Caller the enemy of the people he doesn't even call roll call the enemy of the people\nHe talks about the New York times CNN BS NBC and they are because what they're doing is they're posing as legitimate news outlets when they're actually a propaganda arm for the Democrats and the liberals\nSo what happened we had one of these outlets call for a day of editorials remember that we're going to have a day of editorials on a Thursday where everybody is opposed editorialize about how horrible is that Donald Trump has waged war on the media and they all\nDid it they all did it and they all live the they didn't tell you what he actually said they told you what the talking point was that he said that the media are the enemy of the people who never said that he said the fake news media are the enemy of the people so we know where they are\nAnd they tell us to look at this out of the other one the interesting thing is is it Trump in his sixty minutes interview last night with Leslie stall was able to dominate that conversation\nShe tried and look they have the luxury of editing too and they could and there's no telling what it looked like had have been wrong\nBut even edited\nTo their advantage Trump looked like he just absolutely took into the woods yet she's trying to say this that and you know he's pushing back\nMillennia Trump\nDoing an interview for twenty twenty sane thing pushing back well what about your husband's infidelity I don't this is a structure and I'm not I don't even worry about that kind of stuff I'm not you know she just doesn't let them get under her skin\nAnd now she's handing out water today in North Carolina and Florida and places like this I guess Florida Today\nHanding out water to people that have been devastated by hurricane market say one thing about that too before we run on time because I Know a lot of you folks down there in Florida or listen to the show I Hope this is a lesson the some folks\nNot even a hurricane mark will stay put for a category for hurricane\nI don't think you'll stay put for a category three\nWhen they tell you to evacuate you better evacuate\n'cause I don't understand why people stay around there is nothing in my house to me is worth dying for not listen my kids and put them in the car and take them with me there's nothing worth dying for yet\nWe have the death toll is probably going to go up when they start digging through this rubble and find out how many people stayed there and there was like a bomb going off in your house you don't stay when there's a category three or above don't stay in your house\nWhen it's coming through and I know\nThe part of the problem is the news media hype and they always hide all this going to be the worst because Al Gore says that they're all going to get more frequent and more deadly and all and so it's it's sort of like the boy who cried wolf but one set thing you see it just offshore and it's a category three or above\nMove get out of the way and it's a shame that I think\nProbably most of the deaths I Would think they would all have to be where people who refused to leave weren't they I mean nobody got killed by the hurricane when they weren't there for the hurricane so apparently the people who have died died because they stayed don't stay if not worth there's nothing in your house is worth it [noise]\nOh my God this whole grand piano my grandma getting me it's not worth dying over there's not one thing in your house is worth dying over\nSo when they say that this is going to be a category three or above believe them you can always come back if it was wrong you can't come back if you did [noise]\n\nNothing interesting they apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter\nWe need to bring them into this

in twenty eleven that his relationship with Microsoft is complicated was\nHugely productive and innovative and fun partnership to the lowest there at the end um and I so I went on to you know do many other things uh [laughter] but that was that when that was definitely important chapter in my life\nCNN is reporting that Saudi Arabia will acknowledge that missing journalist was accidentally killed during an interrogation correspondent Elise lab that\nTo understanding now is that the Saudis are going to say listen this was a ... a kind of kidnapping attempted to call in Iran doesn't\nThe question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut it's not a Republican just answering like that oh yeah\nOh they hadn't been a hall and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall\nUnder the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course and how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of them by by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance she re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC which Trump starts talking about how bad the media is\nThis just say hey this is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people who are weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical\nTrump knows that\nTrump is comfortable with that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it\nLed really saw who smart she's listened she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal says liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cut them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing in his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talked period and the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paints this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word in this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nTo benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\n\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says if the end and you know literally and and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of again a battle scars and all\nAnd authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity\nSo he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a kind of just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they are they\nBased their entire campaigns around identity politics and class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n... I mean who what other president other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the entire movement could have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows that lives with one's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you said you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned a live by driving them when Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic Elizabeth Warren will not let this go let it go places

it's the comparison\nYou'll see what I mean in the ... the top one percent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners pay an astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country I think about that\nOut of a hundred people\nPace thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in this country chew on that one for a minute you may say okay\nWell you know that one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich folks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent few liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff\nPays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nTo pick about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... they don't pay that much I don't pay your fair share of the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you know pay your fair share it's not the Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative\nAnd he starts over with that yeah you know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes\nGood job the top one\nPercent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load\nThan the bottom Ninety what the hell is a fair share if that's not if you hear what I'm ...\nThere's more about this isn't just that there's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg peace again not\nOr something right wing website here\n\nI mean the sun and the negative way but I'm sure the liberals listening will be like no you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to

Warren\nJohn Kerry John Kerry used as a as a one percent of one percent or\nWill still insists you don't pay your fair share of they have no idea what that even means it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of that\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn it you might as well burn it you're flushing it down the toilet you know Milton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while either\nIt's always worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great Milton Friedman he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back\nThis way to spend money summarizes completely why the government giving the government money is a total complete epic disaster [noise]\n\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right new spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product you're purchasing matters if your money\nBut the quality of what you're purchasing matters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car you want to go home you want good close you know by crappy suffers gonna fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money left going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people\nFriedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer this equality\nMatter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you're buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you spend money on other people the quality of what you're\nBuying a matter so much it's not yours\n\nOther people there's another way to speed less efficient other people can spend other people's money on themselves you go into work trip\nYour your job is is a is paying for the hotel that's other people spending other people's money on themselves you're spending other people's money on your hotel room this quality matter yeah you're damn right your hotel room you want the best hotel room out there but the cost\nThat no no it doesn't matter that's the jobs money yeah yours give me the the\nThe the top floor of Trump Tower I'll take it\nCost them matter you may say wow that sounds like I'm really inefficient way to spend money all round always gets worse it gets even worse [noise]\nOther people spending other people's money on other people\nThe most inefficient way to spend you can never on here the smoked other people's spending other people's money on other people what is that if the government it is the the the cesspool of government taking your tax dollars to think about the government's taking your money and spending it on other people\nDoes it cost matter how low it their money they don't care what they're buying this equality matter if they're not even spend it on themselves they don't even care here just giving people money\nWhile we're going to pay for their health care but it's crappy out we don't care if that's payer money whatever just go to this friend that just keep spending\nThat's government it is the worst possible way to spend my the government's better off taking your tax\nDollars and buying themselves lamborghini's at least they can look for a quality car and boost the economy or we need we need quality you're not going to care about the costs when they take your money and they spend it on other people the cost or the quality none of it matters nothing\nFreedman was a genius a genius\nYou know understand why it is an imperative to not fall into this gas lighting trap that we're not paying their fair share your fair share as much as you can keep it is possible because every dollar over that amount\nTo fund our military and the constitutional role of government is wasted by people who don't care about the cost or the quality of what they buy the centrally flushing your money down the toilet bowl that's a fact jak\nWe need the Reagan days ... when Reagan made the argument the government is the problem in Trump's doing that

Spygate stuff that's important to do what I did write a book on it literally was one of the great projects in my life I really enjoyed it [noise]\nBut there's been a break in the case or we'll break in the case over the weekend I shouldn't say break a revelation to break in the case happened a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe who's been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice and at the upper level management of the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week it let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed this story somehow I don't know if you've been out in bars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and\nIt's like that Bruce Willis movie or what was that with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [laughter]\nBut Donald Trump people's spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even by I use liberal footnotes too that way to liberals can't repeat what they said in the past on it\nBut the case is very simple in its essence a opposition political parties from Donald Trump bronco bomb in his White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case of the FBI the upper levels in their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it now why am I bring that up now not that give you go well what's great what else is there a lot to talk about them I'm bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise]\nRatcliffe\nLeash they just a torrent of information and Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that that Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going on [noise] remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at a time a presidential candidate the explanation\nSo that's why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seem to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves it started as a whole was all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which is all\nAbout alpha bank that's in my book lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\nFolks the reason the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the old he's kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried the alpha bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out there\nNo shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals Paris there's two\n... George Papadopoulos did it George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information that there you go bingo we got\nAll these gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight as a court there is a verification process for the information that you're supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it means the case that the the target let me give you an easier example this book sometimes a little complicated me ever been a federal agent [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge or a search for that I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence and this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing your job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nOr significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented\nTo the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only the stuff alleged basically in the ... and\nHere say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right now is married to this latest narrative this is all they have\nIf the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI and information the guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole thing that's why this is so critical now what's the big question here\nSank you feel amazing show man don't stop\nThank you I appreciate you listening will talk to you soon quaint time out going to be back in a moment one eight hundred six one eight so we're back into [noise]\nJoined him or not I mean Daniel Glazer long it against them rather than I can talk about it tomorrow night on to protect Ninety nine\nWith a holiday is fast approaching we're gearing up for Nashville rescue missions annual radios on on Monday November twenty of hey it's Brian Wilson inviting you to join us for the one day of the year that we can all give back to this amazing operation that serves the need here in middle Tennessee they help over\nEight hundred men and women and children each day so please be a partner of hope this year in support national rescue missions radios on on Monday November nineteenth right here on super ...
