it\nSays sliding scale of morality and all told we only had our\nChanged by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality times people will go you know how is it that this friend I've had over here turned around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage moral outrage by the media on back of ... a visiting President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality works\nUnless you're potentially responded Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno Chuck Schumer I've you'd be so maybe you know as long as you're not the the sponsor saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo on a scale of one to ten say that one is evil ten\nIs perfection we're all Tuesday nights and therefore at our bass were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that may well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than not well let's say that you started out and and that sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life\nBut when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting you arrange for his first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit\nSo many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people that defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapists waiting he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than I have an idea I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place them around to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view of things through the prism date you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about you and climate science and what fraud they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial fraud the conversation\nThe reality is fraud bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for it\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody saying well her witnesses the ones that ended up repeating her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this was searched that there may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which could be they didn't remember\nAnother might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can commit felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nIt fit sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about the sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office it certainly wasn't about\nThe president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media\nThat sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West and the oval office that is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more\nThan ever before it's important to know where your moral compass happens to be\nOr you five six seven eight where are you where when you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they do or they\nAre they six is not a good day in threes on a bad day\nYou know last week I was talking a bit about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people of things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open to information the first place and the problem is that a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there were only seven percent of folks top to bottom ... ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent through everything that's it\nSo you got to find people that are open minded and open to information as I pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself an add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because anymore\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including\nBy a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world we now live in so ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years\nRemember the last time we were talking about Kanye West and the president\nThat was a

Bush was a racist no\nObject I Do want during Katrina relief effort when we did have the ... ... Bush doesn't like black people yes was I miss memorized by Michael Meyers and what his reaction was as that entire thing was taking place yes\nIn fact I actually went back in and watched out but a lot of uh the the little series there earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was a combination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nHe's looking he'll look it gone you know look at the teleprompter elected gone yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts [laughter] so yeah and\nAnd then it's bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up and start treating the teleprompter\nAnd all the time of it anyway no I I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to introduce policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you Nate and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThat you can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that is a Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nIt has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare providing a path in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you had to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing\nNever forget I've lived many lives even though I'm not all that old I pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\n[laughter] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going be [laughter] I I um I had a smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh end up getting a call and call came from government office during a unemployment verification track verified it\nEmployment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone ever to the employee and conversation takes place and I can tell after a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she was getting really upset I was like OK gets off the phone and she tells me\nYou know what to do just happen Senate making too much money\nSingle mother she's a single mother and she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked last because she was making too much money\nThey weren't actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalyst that uh again James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well of course open change we know it was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at him\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping the economy that will not allow people tablet Ford mobility you're gone right where you need all okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nAnd what do you see\nYou see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue ... not a Republican\nItaly's not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done\nHe made a difference in acting policy they gave people a chance and that means that you create open minds that

days but an interesting week and a well the more things change the more they stay the same which is the hostility and the most pervasive form a biased in the media which happens to be old mission\nNow they're talking about the ... effect throughout the course of this first that we're all with a sliding scale morality here's something else that you probably don't hear about too often\nNow we have had according to the media Research Center observer news busters\nNow Ninety two percent of the coverage Ninety two percent of the coverage of the Trump Administration by news media be negative Ninety two percent and you you compare it to Iraq the bottom of the same point about forty six percent negative\nAnd you know where we were in the economy you know where we were in this country a couple of years into the Obama administration [noise]\nHere's something that you also don't here again the omission\nYou'll have the media media\nIs always happy to say oh here is a poll that shows Donald Trump bad whatever approval\nRating but there's been a truism pretty much the entire Trump presidency the more informed and engage a person is the more likely they are to approve a President Trump\nAnd that remains the gate says we're a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of various different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three percent [noise]\nRegistered voters pretty much around the same but among likely voters we continue to see it rise you'll see some bowling writes about the one boy just we got to fifty one percent and an average of likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great well let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to block Obama's among likely voters his approval rating happened to me right now three points higher than rock bottom three points high\nNow imagine this for a moment president we need to person negative coverage buried your president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote or moose and for those that are most engage\nIt's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you lie to them about what he is or is it in their wallet is true of Obamacare\nThe lives that were thrown out there and we're perpetuating while that deal was going down\nIt was a keen to work you will guaranteed to fail we got a bunch of people don't want to believe they bought into the hope and change okay it's Obamacare is going to be great okay here we are years later the same insurance coverage you have\nTwo percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that we know about the you know if you like your doctor you keep your doctor at all the rest of\nThe voters said as soon as they had to pay for it or place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media covers a lot of folks get\nUpset about the way things or worked right but remember that the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think may have if they\nHad the type of impact in elections\nThat many will skill assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again you know middle they want the people know that they're making more money people will know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better knees are all things that are actually that's why the most informed and engaged\nAre more likely to approve of President Trump is why we might actually be a one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans not losing\nIn this presidential elections like\nThese are all the things are on the table\nYou can't a lotta people value\nLie to people about financial fraud\nAnd we're going to talk about that Medicare for all coming out now because Medicare for all the financial fraud ever for actually I live in for the gray one market look [noise]\nWho are we talking about politics and so much more super dogs and I mean I see

understand they don't actually know what's\nOn I mean I just [noise]\n\n\n\nIf you go back a few years ago\nMedicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points real quickly\nAnd here's the first one\nIf we already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know what's gonna happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal corn into the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in year one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see you\nAnd it gets worse every year from there that currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it\nYou got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do in the bathroom there's one real quick\nFifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\n[laughter] I mean it is financial fraud that's is bigger than Bernie made off yeah you have a political party that's perpetuating it end\nFlorida we've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it financial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud and by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to board has given the joy of race and you're not in Florida that's okay that's okay but\nGuess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist wins where we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right\nHere in my home state of Florida where we have run this day and just it was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republican tore place Rick Scott who was term limited and running for the Senate Andrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians will know you will have the most liberal in less just\nGovernor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum whims and you go well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen we've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Andrew Gillum rode a wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination which is thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is they mail consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check to a ... year Michael Bloomberg sounded like he uses the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this race of ... is critical and again there is one platform piece of particularly\nThat is really important to watch it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic we're talking about the governor's race because we'll Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter\nAndrew Gillum has also run on impeaching President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate\nIt's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years\nAnd benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it\nIt is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better there is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we've got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a ...

because he's usually the people ... and making people dumped are both on the you gotta gotta feeling better once you got a dose of his own a kind of thing there\nAre talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's not complicated and and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike argument you have a Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pasted insolvency in eight years\nFifteen Percent a hundred percent of folks that work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens\nWhen you put the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country and it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is\nPerpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by the NRA sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational here but here's something else\nThat is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person that take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody well I haven't seen any benefit from it\nThat's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments\nTheir their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts so it's all going to be reconciled when they file their taxes when they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody has a I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything now\nThe next part that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because\nEvil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back home their stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well is dishonest to its ally the or CNBC you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] bad the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC what their CFO council\nHave found that a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way who has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not ... percent of the corporate tax cuts\nThis year buybacks right this horrible shareholders of which you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses and employ you raise is thirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should pay it off that helps the company become more stable lessons their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in dividend payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nThe employee but [noise]\nYou know I I guess conveniently that that message has just been missed I'm sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nCould be the most

that you didn't necessarily know specifically we're going to happen with Donald Trump is president but hey you know there would be the moment so it'd be a little bit differently go a and yes you have the fame to outrage the the moral folks in the media\nThat are all my gosh the profanity Twenty years Twenty years removed from the oval office equally a blue dress\nTo Kanye West is using profanity in the oval office is somehow or another Twenty years later oh just reprehensible but the president you know\nDoing a little Lewinsky thing yeah that was okay that was\nActually part of the Nineteen Ninety eight midterm election that whole impeachment effort which is interesting because really the number of different comparison she could actually make between that midterm cycle in this one but are they talking about some of the\nMisinformation out there the fraud that is Medicare for all talked about how much more money will really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year\nAnd then you get into this recent study that was really just mind numbing it's why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey\nRepublicans believe us economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats do came out earlier this week Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Democrats do\nHere's the irony of all this success not exactly being partisan getting caught you west not exactly you're right wing we bubble\nConservative tight but guess who else isn't like all of your richest self made people in this country and I bought a few names

side effects so why is it that\nWould be a rich as the most successful the wealthiest individuals in this country\nActually bean left to use than most Democrats feel the euro us economic system isn't fair\nDoes gets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour sixty percent of adults being financially illiterate\nBut here's the more important point and this is another shutdown argument if you want it you'll have people talk about how much more fair it is elsewhere well guess what the median world per capita income\nIs ten thousand two hundred Ninety eight bucks and the United states\nYou can even legally work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand\nDollars a year so yes the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a little bit ago\nOnly point six percent of the population orange is approximately sixty percent higher than the median income around the world so to all the folks who say that our economic system isn't fair nobody's keeping yeah here\n... let's go

it's kind of unfortunate he he's even ... it's been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm by mud informed more clip and by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but uh nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you like what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea in a comparison real what a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have\nSome of those images in your head in one of the things that I ended up noticing when we were taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground\nZero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado\nOr this you know in hurricanes a lot of people but to focus on the category and the tops of state when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them wow good hurricane be about almost anything but the went just as you saw with sports and the Carolinas just as you saw with hardy\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes\nRarely is it about the wind now Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nYou get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around the its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the five tornadoes go right\nTops the St wins that a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very for Jim I got my my family has been trying

On\nThe other coast I'm south eastern Florida um I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through towards some of the power lines near us they were out power for like going to do actually fared better where Hurricane Irma struck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother and Panama City beach he's older reporters through Michael do run PC beach give me an idea he will as a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina basically fine\nThey are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nThere's something else that is kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be a long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah had an idea there\nWas one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nAnd affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures to Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but to bring and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look at the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before the standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures\nThat were built after Ninety two with those upgraded and updated standards to me and the difference not only in life and death but it can make the difference\nAnd then once you do
