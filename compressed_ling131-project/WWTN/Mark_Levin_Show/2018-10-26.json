I'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nThe coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't in Mr producer\nThere was no panic mode they didn't blame Donald Trump Fort incidentally\nFrom family was receiving some of these things\nThe president who was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said\nI told you yesterday that I could see them together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's\nFully open it's fully open\nThat Trump's words and Trump's rallies in Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first out of the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things in the present us\nThan any politician does\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I were to submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute interview I just spent an hour talking about it you can download it so you can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't really know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we\nHave thousands of radio stations scores of radio companies why do we need a government run radio company where the hosts are overpaid and they have no ratings\nThey don't live by ratings or die by ratings like anybody else you know competition for them it's government radio whatever government radio and a free society for but anyway\n\nSo we have these rice in attacks against Republican senators Susan Collins right after she voted for cabinet other threats\nPositive for rice and sent to Madison the or the the chief of the navy center the president of the United states white powder scent the members of the president's family I really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about white powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\n\nNow why does all this matter it matters because the media are out there trying to determine\nWho politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque thing\nAnd of course it's Trump Trump's to blame but perhaps not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything now\nI Want to um play a montage for you on this pathetic program on MSL as the the morning show and Mr ... you're going to hear and make a but you're also going to hear he never Trump or probably denies he's the never Trump or John ...\n\nYou're going to hear him a couple of times you also hear Steve Rattner Susan do her CEO whoever the hell that is John Heilemann Hi Adam and hire hire them in any way a\n\nAnd I want you to listen to this because it is it is really appalling what takes place on this so called network cut five go\nBut I hear now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that ... that ... was he targeted this is an unusual so the ...\nGo ahead\nSort of the reasons that it is fair and blame him from some surprises rhetoric elects a stock market\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense ...\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot or like Jay moron\nIn some sense ... the you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys over commentary written much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner go ahead\n... cautious I think we have a right or if it were kind of rhetoric wave having this guy over and over again [laughter] that's\nWhat I find that his call the navy or the enemy of his ... and his right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot in the federal judge who was murdered I remember that it was in ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings have kids in elementary schools and there's the media\nAnd then you or your cost the enemy of the people of course we're not the enemy of the pie but what what the hell are you really I what are you what are you doing tonight what did you do this morning what did you do yesterday\nIt's appalling go ahead\nOr whatever ... is a part of this and is being treated as an enemy\nSoon going to have like this consistency me so I ordered she will be complicit in what's all along\nSo he is complicit what follows would a disgraceful fool really to get face time on MSNBC

allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric and they are making people less safe they are making journalists letting taste\nIs the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks waiting in the mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nMeeting up on the media and also just sort of this violent rhetoric calling Democrats and law that saying that they support and that Thirteen incremental [noise] um I'm kind of radical endanger at it's such a staple and the way they talk about on his opponents than you\nKnow I don't let them and it did they do any of this when all that price and or would be powder was being sent to Republicans to the Trump family to Trump to ...\nTo Collins to Rubio\nOr when ... was shot in the middle of a baseball field did you hear any of this any of these recriminations about the Democrats and Bernie Sanders and the left and and how they're just too aggressive any recriminations about black black lives matter or or antifa\nOr even going back to the Obama holder administration where they were trashing the cops and what took place in Baltimore and other cities and so forth any of it\nEver so why are they doing this now\nFor the reason I said the media or not the ... the Democrat Party the Democratic party is the passage of the media go ahead\nWhether it's about Maxine Waters are crazy in June for Jay are calling him a media the enemy of the people on CNN fake news constantly ah people listen to that mostly is fake news\nYou're doing it right now\nNot he calls you fake news I Would say you're full of crap news quite frankly I think the president really let you off the hook he calls you fake news it's a passive term it's a relatively nice them you know your fake fake effective if he doesn't color you are lying pack rats you could do that\nBut he hasn't done that any the irony is even while you're attacking him your proving his point aren't you the bubble people they live in their own bubble go ahead\nOf the rhetoric of a push back then the president's why has any but has Trump\nCalled anybody in the media Hitler many in the media call him Hitler compared them to Hitler many in the media of compared his supporters to Nazis to racists klansmen the neo Nazi I was watching this debate again last night between the scientists and this guy gala\nAnd give them talking about how neo Nazis or supporters of Ron dissenters\nHow neo Nazis are supporting Rhonda Santa's not neo Nazis or doing robo calls but they're not supporters of Ron a dissent is their fate mongers\nRhonda said this probably the leading member of Congress supporting Israel supporting recognizing\nJerusalem as the capital of Israel supporting holding hearings on moving the American embassy to Jerusalem his Democratic opponent\nClaims that he supported by neo Nazis his Democratic opponent who supports the boycott effort and then they die basement effort against the state of Israel he's part of these radical left element that Bernie Sanders radical left element\nHe claims that the sadness is supported by neo Nazis and the media have no problem with it none whatsoever\n\nNone whatsoever they push the the racism narrative everywhere and Gillum was doing that to Gillum has been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of

test well but the accusation would be left up a laugh out of the courtroom if you leave political narrative and cross into your real world effects evidence and the wisdom of everyday experience here's what you know you hear a barn burner of his speech made me get your riled up maybe you are moved to work harder defeat your political opponents\nBut people do not leave a political rally sang to themselves what he said about those bastards really ticked me off I think I'm going to commit a mass murder attack\n\nPlease don't get me wrong he says\nA lot of the speech we're hearing from politicians as reprehensible it's a sign of the time by the way from the media to Andy it's a sign of the times a reflection of the coarsening of our culture an indicator of how we've lost respect for ourselves and the civility a good manners they go with it\nThat was more over long been a category of speech usually referred to as fighting words that has given been given minimal constitutional protection because apparently insults in insights\nLet's see but I Do not mean to suggest that it is inconceivable that any but the most palpable incitement could ever be actionable\nIn politicians explicitly call for violence and violence results they should be held politically accountable regardless whether the circumstances\nAllow for the prosecution my point is simply this no one goes on a bombing spree because of something heard it a political rally no normal person has moved a murder because the here's an ideological firebrand demonize his opponents people who engage in mass murder

suspicious packages former vice president Joe Biden urged everyone to put aside differences\n\nPeople want us to\nThat going out with judge Greg cat that catches the courts only member appointed by president Donald Trump cats are served as deputy White House counsel before Trump kept him for the powerful D.C court of appeals last year\nGoes on\nA spokesman for Mueller's office beat her car declined to comment on the litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow one showing the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging Mahler subpoena beyond Miller Miller's Laura's agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute several other lawyers who represent witness\nThere's another investigation also said there are unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed\nDC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this is actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone filed a motion to quash or otherwise resisted the grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know hey Gibson Dunn and crushed her attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nSank clear what is the case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on most of the party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all Mr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making\nAnd professor ... has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again not\nBecause I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat to Mueller's investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of us that's already illegal legitimacy before a judge is relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here\nSuch questions have also been raised by defendants and some of those criminal cases but all the human defendants who set foot in a courtroom and ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the party or tactics\n\nMystery case is moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief he lie she goes fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\nThis can't\nThey can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry Diller recalled a case from a previous investigation where he couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because there was under steal\nAll right\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller\nI counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler the appointments clause and the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst than others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and robbing the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Muller and this is why these two questions are important stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\nOr is he an inferior office\nFor purposes of a challenge to the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's an inferior officer so reports to deputy attorney general Rosen's thing\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy to an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial appointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Mars some versus also\nKnow the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not it's a legitimate challenge of is it's hard I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd eyes more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court in the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is a it was going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activist so the the final case will have to be made to the Supreme Court if they'll accept that we'll be right back [noise]

Democrat is about as radical left as you can get\nIn the left all over the country is pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects\nRound to scientists who have strongly endorse Rhonda sent us um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there it's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nYeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government to get basically sending money to to build the project they want to two million dollars and so what these lobbyists did is they arrange the number of excursions one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to own infiltrated\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the play Hamilton Rene people hear about these Campbell to pick a day to go to the movie\nTickets or at least a thousand dollars at that time um and so he gave it\nTo Andrew Andrew knew that injures lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that but then do say lobbyists also arranged a luxury for night stay in this Costa Rica villa which ended up costs and about a thousand dollars a free Andrew and his wife a in addition to some other folks\nAnd again the injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLow involved and mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those lobbyists that two million dollar deal that they were looking for and so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobbyists got a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt\nIt's wrong I'm Andrew has you know he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about that but then documents came out almost immediately refuted\nHis denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can because he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line there still to this day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart and the law you understand about\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that now the reason you would do such an act\nOf course nobody knows if he's in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people in him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation I mean that bad that my kids for care um interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem and he was attorney wrote a cease\nAnd desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know more some of these bugs words\nYou can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney did not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said you know ... not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission uh because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\nEnron descent as he immediately tried to racialized decision that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he's tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nAll comes down to one thing that's turned out and if you vote St turning out you have nobody to blame oh I Wish I had voted this um oh I don't wish you'd voted go vote just do the right thing like Johnny ... already

and I sent you an email\nBut I didn't know if you look at it before the show under the day\nYou know that band just look to perfect almost like a Bible rap job as a ... an outlet southern Florida which I spent a lot of time down there\nIt was the fate in you'd see some things that basically indicate that ban is not looking like it just got that job put all that I'm thinking this whole thing is a scam they found the guy that had a medical problem with\nThat probably caught before doing this kind of stuff and they're trying to figure out a way to well just distracted everybody with another problem to divert attention from what's going on which is what's coming up on the border\nYeah I I mean it does seem rather I mean it's like over the top this guy's or Trump guys not like oh you may have voted for Trump or we may have gone to a Trump rally is like this guy is just one thousand percent Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump it does seem a little odd doesn't\nIt seem unbelievable almost
