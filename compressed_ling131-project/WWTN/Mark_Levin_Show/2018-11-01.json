liberals cry louder for single payer health care well England's nightmare worsens this is from town hall\nAnd they talk about um embolden by Senator Bernie Sanders success in pushing for Medicare for all single payer model or running for president twenty sixteen many congressional Democrats have radically changed their tune\nThat only has a single payer healthcare become one of the defining issues with the Democrats today in many respects it seems as though it's the parties only issue of significant importance\nOther than calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump of course this phenomenon isn't limited to federal elections many groups many gubernatorial candidates are saying it's time for the ... much to take over the healthcare marketplace for example in purple Florida\nTallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum by the way you folks in Florida you are you listening to me up there in Florida\nIf you are not getting out and voting good grave it's all hands on deck and Florida and tell you this you have got to get out the input run to Sanders\nAnd the governor's mansion anyway\nSays it Andrew Gillum the Democrats choice to recapture Florida's governorship has been a vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders single payer scheme although he admits it would be difficult for Florida to an act single payer on its own\nBut while the cries for socialized medicine have grown louder in the United states across the pond England's national health care program is facing huge difficulties liberals in America don't want you to know them\nAnd they give some examples here in early October reports emerged\nAs a national health services forthcoming ten year plan would include a policy change that will make group appointments with primary care doctors do the fault option for those with long term health problems under the new model patients will be expected to meet with doctors in groups of Fifteen\nTo save money and time\nIt is billed as an attempt to alleviate strain on family doctors many of whom complain of being overworked can you imagine that so instead of going to the doctor and having the doctor is going to the doctor will see you know the doctor will see you all now so you go in there with Fifteen folks and see the doctor what's up with what's up with what's right and they get out\nHow in the world do you think your proper king or when you're more than Fifteen people seeing the doctor all at once\nDuring these group primary visits which will reportedly lasts about two hours each patients will be expected to share their health concerns as they would normally in more

dial dysfunction we watch over here\n\nSo if you've got diabetes ...\nGoes you know all people with diabetes and reptile dysfunction the basically the same they say ... and to ensure no one in the group discusses the ailments of others when the group primary care sections N's uh each person will be required to sign a confidential or confidentiality ... you know that's going to work don't you oh I'm not going to tell anybody\nI Can't think of a more bizarre and insulting way to treat patients suffering from serious in sometimes embarrassing diseases than to force them to discuss their problems in front of a group of their peers but this is a sort of thing that happens when the good of collective matters more than the rights of individuals\nI got a friend who I Will not name who's a

that Sunday\nAnd I'm going to do things a little differently on that show I'm going to uh do a monologue and I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case because it's an extraordinarily important time in our history and I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling a very bleak force and they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them many like Don Lemon a CNN\nThe thing he said the other day is a firewall offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said and I've gone through and look these are firing offense is but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors of these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this\nThey want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation the United nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations in these executives believe they can ah they control outcomes in this society\n\nAre we going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue\nSaying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar there that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort to curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statute because it will be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it\nThey want birthright citizenship some of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or would have been done already these are the same people in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the laugh says and some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no not things\nThat\nBirthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul\nRyan said preposterous\nIf that's the case that house a statue gonna fix it\nStatute won't fix it because they're saying you have to amend the constitution when's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way and a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\n\nAs we discuss the other day\nAs I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship\nWas not actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies the Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of a cabin all was so crucial\nHe's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\n\nThe president happens to be right about this president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to me write about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than they do\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads when ... when you have the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship with a left\nCherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous presidents that plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq what collectively ignoring endless uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite\nOffer the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to illegal aliens\n\nFourteenth amendment representative James ... who else and Republican Iowa the chairman of the house Judiciary Committee back in the Eighteen sixties who helped draft the fourteenth amendment spoke in fat ethically that it was quote\nEstablishments no no right declaring no new principal on quote quote it is not the object of this bill to establish new rights but to protect and enforce those which belonged to every citizen\nThe quote that's what he declared in Nineteen sixty six and I want you to think about it how many states ratify this amendment\nIf they believed it will be applied to illegal alien babies known as birthright citizenship not a one\n\nThis amendment was passed\nTo protect African American former slaves\nNot foreigners yet to be born who have no right to come into this country illegally\nPeriod\nThe notion that an amendment designed a grant freed slaves who lived here for centuries and had no allegiance to any other jurisdiction the basic rights of American citizens will be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes is scandal is\n\nThe first sentence the fourteenth amendment all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state we're in they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at that time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not only allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American territory are subject to our partial jurisdiction in the sense that they have to obey our laws and our subject to criminal prosecution for disobeying our laws but one congressional drafter added the second phase of jurisdiction to citizenship clause\nThey require it clearly limiting citizenship to those who in the words of one of the three key draft ers were subject to complete jurisdiction as Americans\n\nSenator Jacob Howard of Michigan the principal author of the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment in the Senate explicitly said that candidates for citizenship must be born here and not owe allegiance to any other authority echoing Trumbull\nIf your child is sick over and over again it could be the ... a serious effect of the immune system early testing give children a chance to

the Democratic candidates that started the basics I'm a conservative fighter\nMark you know I took on the Obama administration I sued them we had big victories in court it was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the Obama power plant that was just this amazing power or out over the United states energy supply\nWe lead the way built the twenty seventh state coalition we stop Rocco bomb at U.S

the changes which of of all in West Virginia so we have protections for the unborn\nI'm also strongly in support of the second amendment in our gun rights and we're working tirelessly to help President Trump\nWe think President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country and for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with them or running a campaign partnering up with this president because he's helping turn us around now the flip side of that\nIs you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington the track the water and now he's in cahoots with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and all the radical liberals including Hillary Clinton\nOn the issue of life he sold out west Virginia values he

of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington\nLiberal Joe mansion and conservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win an election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you it's because he not only support to he doesn't trust your image than I noticed throughout his career in the Senate he waits and whites and waits to see if he can throw a safe boat\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about this\nYear right

hardworking\nFamilies and our state the lowering of the rates are but we also have other changes here they're really helping lift our economy out to levels we haven't seen before when you combined the

Obama era\nThey tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work\nAnd certainly they went after fossil fuels I stood up and I said no to that not SATs when I saw those lawsuits and President Trump well he's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia\nWe need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes\nAnd then ultimately deregulating so the regulations fulfill a more basic purpose markets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either\nIndividually or within our communities on the local level when you have federal regulations in place there\nHas to be a very compelling health safety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the rock Obama era or they went so far beyond the pale President Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote in the U.S shut it would\nHave power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people of West Virginia [noise] they need to understand that when Hillary Clinton and her bunch talked about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens\nOf West Virginia told me one of the Democrats done in the last forty years for coal miners I Can't think of a single thing other than trying to put them out of work\nA look I think the biggest thing is when you of a presidential nominee who says we're not put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work you might be able to say oops and try to take it back but the people West Virginia don't forget that's one of the major reasons why Joe mansions going down that is true self\nEmail phishing attacks cost businesses billions annually in real cash data loss and brain damage fishing emails are hard to detect because the messages appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees\nBarracuda fish lined a groundbreaking cloud based solution designed to help employees recognized sophisticated emailed phishing attacks through interacted training reinforced by continuous simulation transform your employees from the liability into a line of defense ... dot com slash appeal to learn or\nShould have the hands were to\nGet in line behind Marlboro Man yet so much love and worthy or show sure we talk about politics and so much more super tall Ninety nine seven WGN views weather traffic and talk [noise]\nI can\nA lot of activity would trick or treaters\nThat my own view about this is the fewer trick or treaters the better you know Mr producer\nExactly more candy for me\nI'm just kidding for crying out loud there was a time at the bunker when I used to put out I've told you this before a big bowl of Hershey bars I don't mean the tiny little ones one bite I mean the big ones I'm not the big big ones but a real Hershey bar and they used to\nNot a big bowl of them used to have like three balls in them and I would do it during the course of the broadcast during the breaks\nInto a few years ago when I Would do that and apparently some kids are teenagers took all the Hershey bars\n\nAnd so there were ... but the another ball out they did it again so I stopped and shut the lights out and said that's not enough of that but now my wife's in charge of it so uh I hear\nA lot of activity going on up there and they yeah Halloween people are talking about should we move to the weekend I don't you just leave things alone what just leave things alone from once\n\nYou know or\nHave you ever thought about the word education it means to lead forth the word fourth raises another question is you know we've talked about this my which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction while the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go now my friend Dr Larry aren't president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that\nAnd that they've been taught to say that you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College had Hillsdale they understand the true education means pursuing the highest answer to the question which\nWay is fourth Hillsdale students are challenged to discover to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books are the greatest minds in history and they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful\nHillsdale holds a unique an important role in American education today I encourage all of your mind listeners turn learn more about this remarkable institution and it certainly is\nAt ...

committee so this country that I'm willing to lay down in my life for on the battlefield is one is worth fighting for in Congress it's an honor to be there\nBut I'm not going to be intimidated I'm not gonna tower I Know obviously that you never will your your audience won't uh and that's the country that we're fighting for its only six days we could do this we can keep control the house we can even pick up a few seats in the Senate and the alternative scares the heck out of my\n... and if the nation wants to help you and the people in on Long Island in your area there you want to get involved where do they go\nTo jail for Congress dot com or you can visit my Web site on Facebook at least ... and I mentioned my Twitter at least ... wherever\nYou live if you have a ... a Republican who's running against one of these on hinged leftists\nWho want to take our country in the wrong direction you're\nFighting on the street on your block with your neighbors with your friends knowing can stay home you can't wake up on November seventh complaining about the country that we have if we don't fight for these next six days you have to earn that with your vote\nAnd you're such a great patriot and that's all we have to do with men and women all over the world who are facing enemies their lives are endangered they've left their home and their families as you did some years back\nAll we have to do is vote makes sure five or six people who we know of like minded also boat and we will strongly a defeat the other side\nThat's right and and our national security I mean the embassy in Israel moving to Jerusalem the president not just fulfilling his own campaign promise and doing the right thing but filling promises of presidents past withdrawing from the fatally flawed Iran nuclear deal\nWithdrawing from the Paris accords were we were making these commitments on our end Waller country like China was agreeing to actually increase emissions\nMeeting your understanding their enemies do not respect\nWeakness they only respect strength we can't be silent not because we want more but because you want to prevent it we have right now a president any national security team behind them\nAs ensuring that American exceptionalism is nothing to apologize for we are respected again and I love it\nWe have to continue going in the right direction and the president needs people in Congress who are going to support him when he has a backbone standing up to threats to our country that is how we protect ourselves a next generation that's how we protect our freedoms and liberties and I'll tell you as an army reservist\nI Know that if I was ever sent into harm's way I Would be sent to win or not sent that all\nWhere we've had conflicts in the past where we send our

last week for promotion lieutenant colonel wow they'll probably serving in her in the reserves as well uh there are many ways to serve\nAnd I uh it's a privilege to be able to to wear the uniform that
