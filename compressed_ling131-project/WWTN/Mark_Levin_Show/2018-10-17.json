I I got to disagree with you when you're talking about that a woman for\nBecause there or something like Ninety two different witnesses and as you know they stack the deck on getting the FBI to investigate so they only allowed the FBI to investigate or of the witnesses and they knew that there were problems with them or to begin with\nWho are there other witnesses you tell them\nOh well there's a there were any number there was his college roommate that uh you know said that he started that bar fight uh there were a there was a one\nWay but that's not that's not a witness to the attack\nWell if if this guy is going to be given a job for life\nAt taxpayer expense and he's supposed to be above the law that that uh we're supposed to look at him with respect and are\nAnd then we're not supposed to just forget about witnesses and only stack the deck on a certain incident that uh\nUh she uh I think she put for something like sixteen witnesses the Nineteen uh are there are supposed to be Nineteen other incidents\nNot just my two witnesses to her\nSo living humans were throwing ice in the bar is going to keep you up the Supreme Court and you did this when you're twenty two years old\nUh it's not just throwing ice in a bar but draw up causing a barroom fight and then lying about whether or not you through the life and the bar and you didn't get arrested and your buddy did get arrested\nA nobody got arrested in that incident sure there was no one person got around there was nobody\nTo get arrested the police came they question everybody there was there was an incident report written there was nobody rested\nI thought some guy got a ... there was somebody got cut right in that incident\nNo well you got got cut with a with a bottle or something that I'm Kavanaugh's friends through at him\nBut yeah they ask Kevin on the police report says you throw the icy says I'm not going to answer so not least they didn't say I didn't throw the ice and we don't know whether you through the eyes or not I mean this is just for the police report so we're going to happen you know we're gonna have ice throwing in a bar in in what eighty four\nAnd you can't be on the Supreme Court for them it's ridiculous and that's why he's on the Supreme Court because it was really [noise]\nNothing interesting they apply when did it become OK for men to be lazier softer fatter we need to bring them into this country back to greatness with age list male Macs a patent pending formula with an agreement that helps boost your total testosterone\nPromoting greater increases in muscle size and twice the reduction of body fat percentage that exercise alone plus an amazing sixty four percent increase in nitric oxide which can be handy in the gym and in the bedroom\nTake your manhood to the max by trying your first dirty diaper bottle free not ten days not Fifteen days for the full thirty days supply free when you text the word quick\nTo Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine states shipping and handling\nFinally a formula that boost total testosterone if you'll results with ageless male Macs are too intense please decrease use for your free bottle text quick\nSeventy nine Seventy nine Seventy nine text Q.

anyway\nOn the talks of her pedigree warranted show Donnie bustamante for report\nPosted on warns website along with others supporting documents in interviews detailing her background according to the report\nOh this is just kind of a minor detail here the majority of Warren's identifiable ancestry is European oh however the report as however the analysis also identified five genetic segment\nAs Native American in origin at high confidence boost the ... analysis places wards Native American ancestry between six and ten generations ago with a report estimating eight generations\nUh okay so let's say go get something near\nMisses where the Boston Globe and their\nTheir ... were you really got off track by the way really got off track trying to figure out a the the six to ten generations okay so if maybe there was a little bit of a Native American thing going on let's say a generations ago\nWhat was that equal here and the answer\nElizabeth Warren as it turns out his moral lily white then Whitey white folk like perhaps you and me\nThat is what the experts have actually been able to find after they dug into the report on our website whoops\nAll throughout the course of the day\nI have heard from my my friends still lives here in the in South Florida as I've been talking about this and the noise continues to be allowed out there and social media and it is fascinating the doors of knowledge on this particular subject that seemingly the average leftist wannabe socialist\nActually has about Elizabeth Warren commonly received the question will why is it why is it that this is even an issue well the first thing happens to be she just made in one again [laughter] and she was her Neal nobody told her to go out there and get all actually President Trump did [laughter]\nPresident Trump did in fact uh do you have cut three ready\n[noise] they're gonna cover hulk I [noise] think of a [noise]\nThe great [noise] tribal heritage what is it a let me think about

God I Apologize for you [laughter] [laughter] oh gosh this I won't\n[noise]\nThat would cause problems you know that name because now even the liberal or say hey get that\nThere you go she took that testing always entertaining and fresh and\nDonald J Trump president of the United states at a rally back in July she took a test so she's the one who put it back out there you know you have to wonder you have to think that the president prompting her like that you think she was like I'd rather take the test\nAnd then he or she supposed to be Ivy League educated right when you actually like try to figure out exactly what the results of your test would mean before you go out there and say yeah you know I'm a I'm jerky here it is and then there's ... ...\nActually no you are a wider than the average white folk here in the United states just saying oh by the way but that wasn't the best smack down to ball now in the end the grand scheme of of entertainment and uh the the full fledged W W E version kinda smack down here\nThat came from none other than the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck asking junior this was the statement that he put out yesterday\nWho coined DNA test do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America sovereign tribal nations set their own a legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage\nSuch as fraternity to an individual it's not evidence for tribal affiliation oh by the way he was in a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely\nIs inappropriate and wrong\nIt makes a mockery out of DNA test and it's a legitimate uses well also does honoring legitimately tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage just proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nAnd once again boom goes the dynamite any questions\nYeah you can have the the president the United states were forward to Elizabeth Warren a bad book on us as he might say as a fraud\nBut really only have to do and listen to the secretary of the Cherokee Nation bed she claims to be blown up\nGoogle or a fraud old by the way on details you know these little things so part of the the liberal argument that I've heard of and throughout the

have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a a story I'm actually working out for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago chicken in the states but a registration and ... and so you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes up or did break for Donald Trump beyond that\nAt least since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida are the best\nThere's we have fifty one thousand\nAdditional Republicans registered to vote oh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people are without registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative job that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst he is you take a look at the economy we have the best ... in a generation I never faulted millennials were buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck but you're a bomb and they go well I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then he got some eyes that are up and\nThat's the guy in the in the generation but we have two Supreme Court justice is tax reform the end of the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis on a plane in the right in forty nine years in by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men\nYeah remember al it's all about the white with white men\nAnd Asian man the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out\nOh by the way but\nYou also have the biggest increase in that take home pay in thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I received the notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it's pays about two point eight percent base salary year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year\nWhen you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated two sides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but\nHaven't seen any benefit for the tax cuts well that's because you know where your employer probably David about which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not saying that it will be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just cited\nYou have to ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why wouldn't you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty he probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often or are we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem you\nTake a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically all these are angry white men men are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration gets what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot and the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've Elise cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is has been dealt with about as he's fully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped toward the spotlight and talking about all that\nNot even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott's\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually have had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration said that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow material now that's where this whole situation with hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own\nThat goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter and a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bond bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot they already moral after you started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who and what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of

Iran but here's the problem the dirty little secret about sharia law in Islam in governments predominantly in the middle east there are still over forty of them they carry the tenants of sharia\nIncluding by the way Saudi Arabia now\nWe haven't necessarily had on track record to see how long that's going to remain part of their government that the bigger problem is\nIf you're on board with shrimp your moral compass really sucks and if you were saying that you can like ah you know kill people at will because I don't know there are a woman they were raped or you're homosexual what else are you willing to do like this journalists thing for example so that's where this becomes the tangled Web\nAnd so it's it's easy to quarterback this thing it's much different to to be pragmatic

like me and the president in this box for after all the president has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia listening there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his painted your country and painted himself\nLike Lindsey Graham did his version of coming out isn't it\nEver since the ... thing it's been a whole new Lindsey Graham and he's\nHe's out these loving every minute of it I mean this is enjoyable for him [laughter] major sanctioned the hell out of the old\nStudy boring to Lindsey Graham anyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous and it's what makes me not just the the idea of just say in the hell out of okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia and\nSays you know what I Know we had\nKind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know\nWe aren't feeling quite as as cordial as we had previously\nWhat happens ... and ... what happens if they say you know what\nWe're just going to go ahead and turn off this big to do back and see what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something that a wreck the economy a little bit therefore you know Presidents Day\n... things that that could happen any number of different implication so I think it's easy for a Lindsey Graham who's out there and loving every minute of it enjoying this newfound freedom\nYou mean the person you always wanted to be that he finally feel that a piece Spain is kinda fascinating do you think about it and I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like oh no I came out I maybe said things that it would that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people did\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect I mean it would take a look at it and the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception in Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happen\n[laughter] I mean it's an interesting day these people clearly enjoying this this newfound freedom from the Trump effect that has come over them\nBut it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know but let's just go to sanction the hell out of them that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our\nWho uh is mysteriously ... where

I mean I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria ... scenario is that the least of which would be well maybe when you how the Saudi officials leave\nThe consulate may left with them\nYou know if your if there are any number of things that can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because well you are and how many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for at that point so\nOf all the scenarios that two weeks later he's still there being tortured I think would be among the least likely but hey do your point anything could be possible appreciate the\nCall now I've been talking about the oddities the oddities politically and in some of the assumptions that often or not white

criticizing the growing international outcry against Saudi Arabia over missing journalist telling the Associated Press so that's another case of guilty until proven innocent correspondent are with daemon reports on new details about the person behind the alleged murder of democracy ...\nLearning from three sources a little bit more about the man who reportedly organized this botched operation we are hearing that he was operating outside the usual chain of command\nAnd then he attempted to orchestrate some kind of a cover up afterwards to prevent people back in Saudi Arabia and of course the king of crop print themselves from finding out about that\nPresident Trump says he will not be responsible and won't accept the blame if Republicans lose the house in November the president as at some people have told him they won't vote since he's not on the ballot President Trump meanwhile as having a war of words a porn star Stormy Daniels and her attorney\nLast way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking or stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of Swiss surprise endorsement which was may be on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now\nI'm going to get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently has a couple of days ago we're still my gosh it's happening I think it's quieted down a little bit over the past the hour or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going\nHey so he was up in Tennessee or see I'm Taylor ... specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain sending in tendencies us in a race you see it at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nShe was averaging a three point lead and the three most\nSome polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead and be the way most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect where is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race is now nine points so\nOh I'm not exactly what you're probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighing in on is negative six percent\nIn a week so I like to say you got two sides to stories on one side of the facts but here's the deal you got a lot of folks that are ... million or the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction or science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing I'm In in the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSafe if you're in Tennessee\nYou're following politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now\nShe said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values but you and say here's the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania huh and she happened only moved to a tendency to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life\nYou know him the Taylor Swift this tendency values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas knowing now\nShe spoke of supporting el ... writes\nAm GB T rights as far from Tennessee values by the way [noise] I guess what the Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton said he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much\n[laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go\n[laughter]\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in in Nashville better yeah\nBut here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who does not support\nGay marriage and host of other old G Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bad evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there's a lot more we we can continue down that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those into the the they pretty much get the point to and law you log\nIn terms of Tennessee values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity and in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't as the ... I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm either way it wasn't that an awkward moment I mean I did the trick is does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTendency L. J. B. T. writes values\nShe could've actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that some Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOberlin praised endorsement really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for broad Obama over Hillary Clinton so if only Taylor Swift headway then whether Pennsylvania\nAlgae B. T. Tennessee values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy\nWho doesn't support gay marriage or the L G Beatty rights than made her look like she is as close as she actually is that she could have had somebody that you know it was going to shake it off\nDo whatever it is that she does these days but nice try Taylor nice try and find a way by the way as for tendency values part of the reason why you have the Democrat Bill Bratton send that is not supportive of those things\nEighty one percent of tendency hands are Christians fifty two percent of the evangelical variety\nOh by the way you might want to at least investigate the state that you claim to be from that you represent the values of just saying\nTwo sides to stories one side effects anyway uh we're we're just getting warmed up this hour Brian ... in for the great one month\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them after my God the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and see status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here I Am I kept finding on Nathaniel ... by half until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands to resolve this tax that for good optimum knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolved over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now phew oh back taxes to the IRS call my friends would opt them a tax relief\nEight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred that's eight hundred for nine nine sixty\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little lists sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nFun to seven nine six four or five that's F.

attorney general you know the the former top law guy in the country I mean you you can really see the value system air when they go low we kick them okay violence yeah that's that's cool are just like Maxine Waters who I was encouraged her I mean it's not like we had a somebody who went in and hunted down Republicans at a baseball field or anything\nOh wait we [laughter] [noise]\nGee it's almost it's almost like it's imbedded in many of these Democrats [laughter]\nYeah just the peace and love the open mindedness it's all there for you all there you can feel the love build on why wouldn't you want to be part of that by the way it's oh I'm Sorry oh let's go to Joe in Jersey Joe go\nHey Brian how are you all good a\nWhile I was waiting for you I just thought of something and extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um\nThis this Taylor Swift thing could be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being any body of any value or wacko value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen and Tom Petty were they were held in the war drums the recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song his we won't back down um it was all a it was all kind of aggressive music that hinted towards we're coming at ya\nBut they're the St they will come from the same cost especially Springsteen were they were anti war ah it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping to God that people are just not taking a serious anymore\nI can tell you I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there's some\nThis is where the celebrities do play if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there's research that did show a from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the first thing is you got to find somebody who is open to the information if you find somebody has closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most as offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of dodge meant until I was sixteen made that kind of thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania [laughter] same\nThing too many of the folks in Tennessee that those people and so it's kinda like a no offense to you and in in Jersey joke but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey not not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state um for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more\nThat's that's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is that I or in a certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just ah\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will if I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really you you got some work to New Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy\nWith what's going on in North Dakota Halen\nOh I'm not liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and honestly with the Kansas sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nI'm very quickly I didn't vote for Obama I ah I'm I'm probably believe in gay rights I slowly and believe in freedom of religion I fully believe that a woman's right to a woman's right to choose [noise]\nI'm I'm Down the line I but I have always then I never said calm\nTo what anybody tells me without my own thought process behind it good and so I Am the absolute I Am that moderate that everybody wanted me over and the other side
