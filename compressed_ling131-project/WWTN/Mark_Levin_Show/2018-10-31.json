bureaucracy began\nNot even interpreting the constitution Jess conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\n[noise] my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of national views these want to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion to address the issue\nCodified in the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then we have Paul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr boost and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch kicking back being Saudi do interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\nThat's not who is changing immigration laws you know I brought as a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent he writes over a conservative reviewer and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\nOh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the law the or patriot dad he's a he's not replace thank you\nUm you know this is constitutional it constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop the kid there\nAnd he has the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you can do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do that through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agreed to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate eighth floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant\nUnder any circumstance as the court didn't want to ... a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersedes that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive early but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing to law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... actual lifts and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly what they meant\nAnd nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right um even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S\nIs a citizen I got news for them for a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases of written by the one Kim all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access to the court in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil\nAnd and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument that someone\nWho is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to\nMandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that for most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nStar
