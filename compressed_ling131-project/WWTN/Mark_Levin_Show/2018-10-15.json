D. P. modeling but we've got 'em all but the triggers on those things you can just stage um like a single act you know they are just so great and part\nPart of what makes the trigger pulled difficult on some guns is that the people pull a to slow the fatigue the muscles in their arm because they're pulling so slow the trend hit the little orange dot well now that can be difficult so you can ... single action fire a lot easier\nWell uh anyway so\nAh so we got a I I was going to tell a talk about that a law man tonight or today and so we've done it\nWe go walk at all I did last night that I Do want to mention one thing real quick that that I I keep on seeing about people's pistols automatic pistols in particular but it can happen in ... to what the condition we call a squid load so small it again this week got a Ruger pistol in his at a squid load in it\nIs ... couldn't figure out why couldn't open slide just because there was a bulge in the barrel\nBecause he had had some kind of anomaly some kind of cartridge that didn't push the bullet out of the barrel I just want to and and so then the second bullet strikes the first and Bulger's the barrel well or he wasn't injured the ... the only thing that I think is damaged the barrel with a pistol but I Want to just mention one more time that if you ever uh shooting along\n... ... or whatever and I'm not ... I Do re loading but if you buy ammunition and you find that you hear different anomalies one on one was quieter than the other\nThe stop and have a look at it before you hurt yourself or damage your gun ... here's something strange while you're shooting of stopping check it out now\nGot a ... on a very important and I think in Port in any way\nAnd this is the worst thing you can do is change banks that did that would just kill you to have to change bank chick you do get everything has to do wow that is\nDriving down the damn hard if you got your email and they put the heck's on those\nBut anyway the fence as far as the bank and I know they got a bunch of branches around here and I tell you what\nThe president of the bank could be our best customer and I'd still say it ... if I banked it fifth or bank I find me another bank is that right and I do because fifth or bankers come out this week and said we're not going to do anything for gun don't see any more we're going to loan money to gun people well like spikes tactical yeah\nThey're they're a gun company down there that does you know they make all kinds of good stuff and they have sent letters ... board of directors no longer going to invest\nAny money in anybody's got anything to do with guns not going to do it\nWell that's all right if you can stand it that's fine you know and I bet they invested liquor it I just got back ... three hundred and six three billion dollars so you know my Thirteen dollars wouldn't hurt I'm going out of there you know\nBut uh and it it looks somebody a lot of farmers merchants they'd love to have you made your farmers by they love that city group that's another you don't want bank of America as another ... won't be got credit card and things and people get rid of costs they are anti Second Amendment and our anti people that have guns\nThey got ... percent known aboard there that don't want your business if you got guns to do so yeah\nI generally finished third bank probably advertise or somewhere\nYou know and they got on this radio show and they will help if I run me out of here more you know probably ought to hear now because I've done it now well I've done it now ... you say anything about us bank [laughter] no Middle East bank or at least it might be on the list but I don't\nKnow oh okay [laughter] I ain't smart but [laughter] but anyway uh Smith Wesson a dove a classic\nSeries guns there and make the model a twenty seven and you know they go back and make all the old guns that they they quit making they're doing a model of Nineteen combat master\nPiece and are they discontinued\nThat gun in Ninety nine and everybody said it was a time frame by frame I think it was yeah light small and the cops wanted it and everything but after they shot a bunch of three fit submitted it shot it loose\nAnd uh so they went back to the and Frank guns or something I don't know what an automatic whatever but they're making that man's bottle Nineteen again and it's still in a cave frame but they said now you can shoot all you want to fall heavy load in it and it's not going to shoot it loose say redesign it where\nIt was oh I remember you know I'm going to have to talk about then again listen next week it was trying to remember to talk about\nBooks [laughter] books this has been ... radio our hero Ninety nine seven WGN if we really enjoyed that hope you'll enjoy their Facebook Live\nAnd uh we're going to go home now because I'm getting hungry and\nLosses just tired of the thank you so much for being there they're not [noise]\nFedEx delivery game ... ... what we term after by collapsing\n[noise] the possibility of lung cancer can be pretty scary especially for women to approximately ... million current and former smokers in high risk that's why I see by the skin ... once you to know that now due to break too low dose E.

friday we we had a lot of people come against us and the people that came against this were people proclaiming Jesus so ah one lady you know you talk about engaging\nUh this one lady gets out and uh she was talking about how sorry she was a we proclaim Jesus that we were doing what we're doing and she was really morning that us\nIn how we were engaging and we're engaging in love and she thought we were wrong than at another young lady gets out with a cross around her neck thing she represents Jesus and I began to talk about our child and and she agrees that God created everything and I say you know God created your child in\nAnd then she turned on me and got pretty angry with me but um\nYou know I had it and then we had another Christian uh that that we're doing it wrong that we shouldn't be out there engaging like me and the whole reason we have Planned Parenthood's reason we have abortion mills the reason there's the struggle with pornography\nIs that we're not engaging with us you know we're we can't rely on I mean the government yes I I Wish they could help but at the end the day it's people it's the church rising up and doing with\nThe church called the day six one five seven three seven nine nine eight six any comments questions struggling with porn overcome porn had an abortion how ... how you're living with that\nSo many years after having an abortion what does that like marriage suffer because of pornography you've lost your job because of pornography but I'll tell you what's going to take those three people have got to the current approach you they're consistent they're consistent in the western Christian that's what a western Christian is is\nTo play everything safe or manage thin and just go on Sunday here a good sermons feel good about yourself and then you know will pick it back up on Sunday but let the let the let that stuff just getting wider and wider instead of going to do joining capping the route which you're doing\nWhich I'm trying to do is we're going to the source where exposing the darkness with the light and that makes a lot of Christian western Christians feel uncomfortable you know and um\nYou know can you imagine

sons or wife or you know the struggles they've gone and it's like\nWe're like yeah I mean we've been there we get it and you know you got you got some brothers ... and we get a ...\nThe end um [noise] you know what I mean we you know my my focus is on you know for things right now that we're growing in but I'm also talking about the warrior spirit men have a warrior spirit and I think we're losing at some point in a man's journey is either been beaten down to monitor he's given up and he loses that warrior spirit\nThere was a warrior spirit look like on a day to day basis like if I wake up tomorrow with a warrior spirit how's that play out in an average man's life as it goes about to work and you know it's one thing at work but what is the worst fear it looked like there and what's it look like at home and yeah marry\nWell I look at a distance as we've got this unique a billion when I called the the worst spirit is\nI'm a competitor mhm I Want to compete and I don't want to lose so you know that's how I grew up that was my life in sports and coaching as I like to win\nBut I Want to be I Want to win in life and I want to take that spirit of you know what I'm putting everything and I've got one hundred percent into my marriage one hundred percent of my kids one hundred percent of the stranger next to me one hundred percent to the bartender last night my wife and I went out to eat and I go right to the bar I sit down on my Bible\nAnd next thing I was just engage with a young twenty three year old girl\n... you know are living in a you know with a with a boyfriend to kids and\nNext thing you know the gospel is being spoken and it was like man it was like\n... to the Holy Spirit took over in me to go you know this person that you're talking to is sacred their sole counts ... now what is what are you going to do well it could have been very easy that's uncomfortable and I can just walked out but I felt like the you know I'll say the warrior spirit took over and said you know what man they need they need God\nAnd I'm going to present the gospel and you know I'm going to let my kids morning I'm also going to do this and I'm going to make sure I'm not harming myself I'm gonna love myself yeah I'm not a point in my mind and my soul\nI'm not going to drink you know not not an odd people dream but you you know what I'm saying uh drinking can be a trigger for a while you trigger yeah I just want to be the best I Want to be the best job that I can be every day for anybody that's around me yeah and I want to be able to clearly discern what God's says to me\nAnd I can't if if I'm living in\nJust la la land or focusing on things that don't matter or just feel you know man I just have it today I don't feel like you should you know get out there and get after it man I I Want to compete I Want to compete for souls and build the kingdom\nYeah I like what you said you know the worst fear is is is about being one hundred percent in Jesus once one hundred percent\nOf your heart he wants one hundred percent of your talent he wants one hundred percent of your wealth\nAnd we're looking at that today I preached on a dime store treasure on earth store treasure in heaven and that call there and Matthew six Nineteen is really to be all in it says if your eyes\nAre good you'll be full of light but if your eyes are bad you'll be full of darkness and so it's just one or the other and then right after that it says you're going to serve either this mastered the master righteousness or you're going to serve the master of sand\nAnd so yeah it it ... in revelation three speaks to it as well as the\nThat way harder grateful that is that's a that's a good thing men you know what did you I Know you've been listening what do you think about Curtis man he's twenty two year old dude man Conan are gonna were jumping in the ... with them just bought a lot of courage just like you know when you call it just kind of sharing your story so um I think men are rallying around man they want they want to change\nA yeah there's this is actually something that was somewhat more mainstream Kevin more mainstream press about a year and a half ago time magazine actually did a story on young men for turning away from corn actually\nHad a ...\nYeah I got to kind of has an a copy it wasn't a friend just said porn and had a a screen I think on time I think I got there article too is said young men are turning away from turning away from it yeah really\nYeah they feel like it's happening there were actual people in society properly\nAnd they can have sex without a screen like they're going to have a relationship like physically have sex so they've turned from one evil\nAnd they jumped into you know there was anything that got the one of the guy said he's like yeah man I'm I'm knocking out checks left and right now that I'm watching point I'm like I was like oh wow yeah so where are we going to be going in this world yeah well adjusted man listen I'm praying for you All right and I'm praying for these so Thursday's your show\nA yeah Thursday as are opening night\nAll right man will just we just had a quick minute I wanted to hear from you appreciate you listening in tune in and I'm ... gonna always be praying for you man you you sound good man he's still getting the word a little more me probably a little bit more I I Love it\nYeah I Know the fact that I haven't taken that much if that's something of a character flaw on my part\nWell hey we're all will judge or some other where your spirit man yeah that we're ... we're up and let me ask you what do I what about watching porn where young with that\nOr haven't really touched anything in a while have not imbibe\nWait a second you have not watched it in a while you're while be two weeks three weeks\nOr maybe about two weeks by the guess\nOh my gosh you got to start that's a great start man proud of you man keep ... keep kids don't go back to that stuff man you get three weeks you're done you're set free but only one way you can be free and that's through Christ so Justin hey we're going to be we're gonna we're gonna have you calling in a couple more weeks man I Want to hear the pilot's going\nAll right well the of the dog you got seven at night\nGod Bless man see that as a cool man loves Justin none of talking to them in the first time we talked to me as well and good now he's down yeah but the last time when he's been he's excited but what does he done\nHe's changed his daily thing he said you know and it's been a lot of time in the apartment or house whatever but now he's on a play games with people is engaged with people I think he's actually said he got maybe a something going on at the church like um I don't know if it's a Bible study but you sound like you were doing more stuff and I'm yeah I'm that's awesome\nTo me is what's the power of community I mean for us as guys or something in is it doesn't want to live in community I mean there's a part of me that you know you go home and\nJust do you're saying there and in retreat and you know you got to go to work you gotta make a living and that's good enough that men you never can reach your potential when you live in isolation and the sad thing is it's it's possible that even in your church\nIf you go to a big enough church you can show up at that church you can sit in the Pew and sit in community but never be in community and in turn never\nReached the potential to God given potential\nThat God wants you to be God designed all of this for community and you only a reset potential through community and it's nice not just a I got to be careful there 'cause that community could be\nA you know there's communities in bars or communities at clubs or has to be a community of Christian men that love the lord who are pressing in and trying to walk this\nHang out so I think first just for guys also is you know yes one having that community\nBut you have to have a relationship with Christ you've got to build your foundation on that because sometimes even if we do get around guys hearing their struggles and you're just like man I used to might not know where to turn to but it's just like just going to church as we might have a great pastor\nBut we can't focus on the past there should be connected after Christ that we've we've got to have that vertical a relationship first and foremost would you agree yeah yeah\n... it all comes to the the vertical relationship and he ... he pointed us there and at the same time equipping\nYeah and then having guys that are like minded that relationship with Christ that you can talk and pray with I think that goes I notice in supporting to pray pray with men yeah right yeah and we gotta keep in mind I mean\nPastors or just regular guys do you know there's nothing\nA special about us you know there's a ten people tend to elevate us for some reason but we're just as a messed up as anybody else on the journey with Christ in this journey of St vacation yeah that is a it is a there is a lot of pressure I I think\n... can be some of the loneliness men in the world yeah because there's an expectation there that uh we walk the walk at a level that nobody else does and uh you know it's not true yeah it's not true you need you need people need a need brothers man you know on the community a\nFix one

for an African American to step out of line and not to be a liberal Democrat\nThere is no more loyal partisan voting bloc in America than African Americans especially African American women they vote like Ninety six percent democratic African American men vote about Ninety percent but\nThere's no more loyal part isn't good for the Democratic party than African Americans especially for American women some as diamond in silk about that but\nWhat happened Tuesday and Wednesday I think a ... was in the White House I might have been Tuesday or Wednesday and CNN hundreds Jeff Zucker viciously and racially\nUsing for Jordan racial terms racism attacked Kanye West but courage sellers who's a former Democratic office holder and South Carolina\nNow he's a paid contributor to CNN said about Kanye West quote Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read\nStories you know he said he's illiterate stupid he went on to say quote\nDonald Trump is going to use it in pervert it and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures but then it gets worse CNN said terrorists set Meier who's I coins herself as a former Republican said quote this ... this is an average American Woman talking quote\nBlack folks are about to trade Kanye and the racial draft they've had it with him he's an attention whore\nLike the president he's the token negro of the Trump Administration unquote\nSo you have an African American paid commentator saying\nNumber one she is speaking for all black Americans black folks are about to trade Kanye the racial draft they had it with him hey she's spoken to thirty five million blacks and that's what they tell her and and it really couldn't it got much worse so racism was used by CNN\nShe went on to say quote no one should take ... seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized unquote Jimmy Kimble said that he's irrational and the madman snoop doggy dog a doggy cities local Tom and so\nEntertainers comics late night comics have gone after in the past Clarence Thomas\nAnd Jessie Molly Peterson and Colin Powell and Benjamin Carson and Congolese arise in others for being disloyal to the Democratic party when the Democratic party has not been anything but disloyal to African Americans and hurting them practically every chance they have\n... it's incredible to watch what's going on back for the past half century\nNinety percent of black voters have cast their ballots for Democrats a national elections even though it's against their self interest the Democrats have consistently opposed Coach Joyce trapping kids and failing public schools for generations\nThey've ... Democrats have promoted illegal immigration which is destroyed black working class jobs\nAnd champion Bill Clinton's pro NAFTA policies which have led the massive levels of unemployment in black communities\nThey've also Democrats who crippled the black families find bracing welfare writes the penalize married couples to get married it goes on and on and on\nAnd this was all set in a sense of CNN's Don Lemon who laughed with venomous Scully at what these other African Americans were saying can you imagine if a white conservative Republican had called some black guy a house negro\nOr you sell the racial pejorative against them they wouldn't be kicked off said but not when their own get to do it and they do it with such ... and you know when you think back in history\nWhich CNN did the Kanye West borrows from an ugly ugly and tragic history of slavery and the pre civil war you see white slave owners who wrote Democrats ruthlessly\nPunished any black man or woman who sought to educate themselves and think for themselves the Democrat white slave owners in the south headed control blacks maintaining power over them and after the civil war ended conducted by Democrats\nSlave owners had to release their slaves but they formed the Ku Klux Klan Democrats formed the Ku Klux Klan\nAs a terrorist arm of the Democratic party\nTo intimidate murder Lynch suppressed and destroy any political activities\nOf the newly freed black population to keep them under control if they threaten the Democratic power structure believe me the Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan went after them hard later on in the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codify into law the idea of literacy tests\nAnd other means and methods to dumb down and keep African Americans poorly educated and keep them all in line\nTo protect their power Ninety five percent of black people continually vote for Democrats because his sample shouldn't media like the CNN and ABC NBC and CBS\nControl black Americans to keep them in line to keep them under control we're while I watch free thinking African American men and women be partially destroyed\nBy CNN and the mainstream media in Democratic Party and so\nThen I look at the results of the Trump Administration black unemployment historically low\nCriminal justice reform is coming\nHe's fighting against illegal immigration that hurts black workers he's trying to find a solution to the never ending slaughter of black men by other black men in Chicago dominated only by the Democratic party\nAnd he's going to try to make it possible for Democrats to sit down at the table of equal economic opportunity\nAnd so what happened and Kanye West has the same crap that's happened to Clarence Thomas\nTo Jesse ... Peterson the Congolese arise to any black who steps out of line they're called madman like by Jimmy Kimble they're called uncle Tom's like by Snoop Dogg they're called mentally ill by Don Lemon\nAnd they allow the racism on CNN dummy employed\nAgainst a black man if he doesn't express the right political viewpoints that is why CNN working with the Democratic party\nMuch destroy Kanye West and and they do their best but I don't think it's going to work I have trust and faith that African Americans maybe in three weeks we'll discover and learn what the Democratic Party\nHas done to them and not for them the truth is just take a look at the education system and the crime in cities like Baltimore Chicago Detroit Memphis or Milwaukee the schools are completely dysfunctional that black families completely broken there's no job creation\nThe average black student comes out of high school in Milwaukee or Detroit or Chicago reading about the eighth grade level unprepared for the world of the twenty first century and all those cities that Democrats have been in charge for the last fifty to eighty years with no discernible results\nYet when a black man like Kanye West step settle on him against their expressed support\nFor a different political outlook he has called every dirty rotten filthy racial name and the book because it fits the idea of the Democratic party keeping blacks in

go watch a high school football game where the relative playing but I thought well this is pretty important so on Wednesday I made a request to the White House to do a short interview\nWhich of the White House should said should be kept her about five minutes if it's granted I said okay actually turned out to be almost Fifteen minutes because the president had so much fun\nSo I met the president in a hanger on friday evening and about an hour later he was going to go speak in ah north of Cincinnati about thirty miles north of Cincinnati and Warren County\nThat I Am a Republican gathering of which twenty thousand people show up and little Warren County while standing in a field with a light rain in cold dark\nAnd the sun was down and must have been forty forty five degrees the president let 'em up so well on friday night the White House said no problem I met with the president\nDid like a Thirteen fourteen meant an interview and the references to about an hour from our relate to the what was going on in orange county\nAnd then yesterday Saturday he was in Kentucky and uh and beautiful and I think he did he told me off the off air is going to be doing this three or four nights and the next three weeks and he said I got more energy about this than I've ever had\nSo here's my talk with the president that uh was approximately seven pm on friday night tater had it\nFirst of all Mr President welcome to Cincinnati thank you your long distance relationship here I Do I have had a ... a head swift in\nWith my father a long time ago and we uh we did a good job we fix it up\nWe uh eleven hundred and sixty four year underserved remember the exact we fix it up I worked here for two summers sick of fighting in the garden that's right right by since I don't even know if it's still there no they knocked down about six months ago a really gone the whole thing is ... everything's on what's going to happen\nWith the making of housing development oh okay good but it was great for us we fixed it\nAnd sold it for more money and ah it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city let's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all in the world are coming in how important was due to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and it was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nBut we got him back and we got back to Iowa we got back many people actually if you look at it as like just seems like all the time we're bringing back people and uh I Know President Obama said one point eight million for nothing you bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safer shortly he's in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll in the in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage\nNow he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure is very happy right now about your wife is great you are a lot to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa well she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go\nAnd see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live and she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and other kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you are going to\nContinue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such on a human basis they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nPills you really had a big impact on me\nAnd the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat is that why what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come in and Rob and uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada that just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all the use of what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making our refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make and I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we're just trying to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with south where so\nMany jobs and talking to my everybody talking about Canada Mexico are we talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potentially don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff to make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall\nRidden a bitch that's Joe ... Chu is the Democrat was up by one point we have a new poll out today folks this is the poll taken the eleventh through the fourteenth released today by New York times Sienna\nPete stall bird the Republican in this democratic district in the middle of Minnesota is up Fifteen points\nIs anybody talking about this today but your uncle Phil\nThis is what ballot ... political the rest of these folks that this is one of the top ten seats we need to be looking at while I'm looking at it they're not anymore ... well now hold on now that doesn't really mean anything doesn't mean anything does it\nThat's the sixteen point swing in a month what do you think happened over the last month\nCabinet ... yeah Kavanaugh happened Disney yeah\nAnd the people don't like what they saw going on\nI was talking to somebody yesterday and they said listen this is somebody in Tennessee and they said look\nI'm normally a moderate vote Democrat and a lot\nBut I'm looking at these nasty people up in Washington DC\nOr that are protesting and screaming and hollering and their Chuck Schumer is people and these people are crazy and there's no way I can allow Chuck Schumer to take over the Senate so\nI'm not voting for Marsha Blackburn this person said I'm voting against reticent 'cause of vote for breath as soon as the vote for Chuck Schumer I'm going to exactly\nI don't even need to tell you you've already figured it out on your own I don't let me tell you\nWhat if you're looking at the sentiment around now of course not one district is going to be the district but could this be sort of a canary in the coal mine\nThat's my question today this is a huge swing and this is Lee it'd be one thing if we took ... looking at two different poles we're looking at the New York times saying poll\nSane people polling seeing people doing it as a New York times or sixteen points swing from plus one for the Democrat the plus Fifteen for the Republican in just a month in just a month\nSo I'm Wondering if this isn't an indication of some things a foot\nHere's something that could very well happen folks are talking about what the Democrats need to pick up twenty three Republican seats to take over what are they don't pick up any\nOr what if it's a net gain for the Republicans in the Senate in the house what is going to happen with the media these folks going to lose their mind because let me tell you something my friends my friends\nHave pulled out all the stops to make sure that the Democrats win in November they don't know what else to do\nOther than just completely be overtly Democrat what you already are anyway but I mean just to say so long before okay screw it we're all Democrats we got to you know you remember this call you\nRight before the election in twenty sixteen I can never remember to Google his name but he was a columnist for the New York times and he says All right we've got to draw", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "15"}
