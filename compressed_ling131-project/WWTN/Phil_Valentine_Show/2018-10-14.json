{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Keep you I'll keep you healthy it's real genuine replacement parts that's what the body needs and that's what it's been lacking for many many years you know all these symptoms and stuff that we've been talking about whether it's a thyroid problem or high cholesterol high blood pressure problems or high blood sugar\nAh and it's taken about ten years for that to develop you know you just don't wake up one day and uh\nUh go to the doctor and he diagnosis us having high blood pressure that day or that's not the way it works it actually takes about ten years for this to wear and tear the body has a thing called homeostasis so it's always trying to reach balance is trying to handle it behind the scenes\nBut if it doesn't get the genuine replacement parts to be able to repair and fix it\nThen you're in trouble but uh the body is very resilient and it'll work with whatever you give it if you give it a bad food it'll try and make good out of a bad so most of our food is bad it's processed food\nFor the first time in the history of man the American family is now eating sixty percent processed food and are never happy eating more processed food than real food\nBut that's what's happening and uh people are falling apart we got a an epidemic of health problems\nNow the solution is also seems to be a problem because the solution is just to manage it OK let's wait until you have a health issue and now we'll manage it okay let's you know again use high blood pressure is an example or even thyroid on that ... that's our subject here today [noise]\nUh so what will come in as a they'll they'll come in and they'll say okay you have a thyroid problem or you have high blood pressure and here's the medication for it well here's my pet peeve\nThey never say why did they go up what caused it to go up why did the uh you become a high both I ride 'em they never looked to find out why\nI'm most doctors that are trained a nowadays are disease dropped doctors are trained in disease or they're not trained for functional issues how do you handle something like that\nAnd here's another scenario I seek specially with thyroid is they'll have be having a blood test done\nAnd the blood test the doctors say oh it's normal and what they're testing for is a product called a T. S. H. fibroids stimulating hormone it it comes from the pituitary gland a and it tells the thyroid to make its hormones so it's called the TSA\nAnd what happens is they'll they'll find it in the blood and we do the same thing in my office we do a lot of blood tests at my office ... anywhere you go in the world and they said they're going to check your thyroid uh that's what they're checking his the ts age\nUh now unfortunately if you're TSA comes back medically normal which is a in this area it would be zero\nZero point three five to five point five I think comes back with in those ranges are considered normal\n... unfortunately you may not be normal oh there's a whole set of other numbers blood tests numbers that are used for functional problems and these were put together many many years ago by the lab associations they wanted to know what um what is it uh\nWhat are the numbers that uh would be healthy numbers we know what the ...\nThese numbers are what are the healthy numbers so they put these numbers together many many years ago\nAnd then most doctors forgot about him because they don't use them today so they're called functional ranges so in my office we use the functional ranges when now we're interested in the laboratory ranges but we also use functional ranges so we look at the blood test a little differently or say then you're a general practitioner\nSo the functional range for the TSA your thyroid stimulating hormone\nIs one point eight to three if you're out of that range of one point eight to three we're going to take action now at least in my office we got to find out what's going on with that thyroid if it's out of that range we're not going to wait for it to be at zero point three five to five point five or by that time you need medication\nSo we're going to find out what's going on with the thyroid we're going to get a good strong we're going to help get rid of any toxins around the cells and get it functioning right get it healthy again and um\nThen you'll feel feel well now a lot of people that come to my office that have thyroid issues are already on the medication\nOr so but we have to do there's we have to clean up the systems we have to um support the thyroid and we have to clean up the systems now like I said earlier before the break here that it takes a while if you're on the medication to get off of it in a while I mean maybe a year\nMaybe even a little longer um because you're shutting down your thyroid and we're trying to stimulate it with nutrition and get it up and get it going [noise]\nSo there's a way to figure that out as time goes on but our first goal is to get that thyroid good and strong\nAnd then the second goal would be to start cleaning up the thyroid getting rid of the toxins that heavy metals that are around the thyroid a and we'll find heavy metals there's two ways that we look at heavy metals that my office one is through a hair analysis\nOr everyone that comes to my office uh they do a hair analysis\nAnd the hair analysis will tell us what heavy metals the body is dealing with in other words it pushes it out through the hair so you'd have things like aluminum mercury you'll have a\nArsenic a cadmium lead those are the ones that will come up through the hair\nUm each one of them has a certain area lights in the body like aluminum loves the brain uh for some reason that likes the brain gotta remember your brain is about sixty to eighty percent fat so uh that aluminum or heavy metals gets embedded in the fat\nSo there are certain areas that we look at when these the heavy metals come up doesn't really matter of words that we are going to pull 'em out\nAnd like I said earlier we work with a a a a system that has real binders to it so it's actually it's been Scientifically Proven to pass the blood brain barrier and Paul heavy metals out of the blood brain barrier\nWhich is hard for a lot of things to pass through that's there to protect the brain the brain doesn't like a lot of things going through there\nSo it will pass through there and start pulling it out now in this case in our example here since we're talking about five really were also interested in getting heavy metals off of the thyroid and getting it working and functioning better\nA wall so I have to clean up the digestive system a and we'll talk about that here in a little bit\nBut the thyroid a we have an epidemic thyroid issues are mainly due to our food supply and all the chemicals that are in their ah the thyroid the purpose of the thyroid is to uh\nTo handle your metabolism uh when most common is high both thyroid which means that your metabolism is slowing down\nAnd if your metabolism slows down as what your\nBody has to do something with all that waste product in there and you can get re absorbed into the body the body is trying to read it out your metabolism is slow you go to sleep at night and it gets re absorbed\nAll right so we're going to take a short break here will come back and we're talking about the workshop you got one coming up this Tuesday at six thirty PM and if you're interested\nCosts six one five three three three zero zero five

recently issued Saudi state man\nThe kingdom of Saudi Arabia extended its appreciation to all including the U.S administration Fort Worth training from jumping to conclusions on the ongoing investigation\nUh I find many many times a person comes in and they gave me their blood tests and sure enough laboratory normal a well run the test or we take their tests and we put it through our computer so we can look at the functional range and we can start seeing patterns show up\nBut just running the T S H um by itself unfortunately the insurance companies won't\nBefore anything else if it comes back laboratory normal but in most cases it's just a waste of time you got to run\nOther um other\nMarkers within like the tea for what we call free T for there's total tea for which is the hormone bound to proteins as well as free then there's free teeth for which is more and more valuable to us which means how much is available to the body not bound to protein so that's the free T for\nA ... a free T three so if we run the those if we ran just those three are we could find out about the thyroid does is accepting the TSA chip it's not then it's going to stack up in the blood and it's going to get high so you always have a high number to have hypo thyroid so no that's a thyroid issue\nOr if we could see the tea for is the uh let's say we have the free T for and now we can see is the thyroid making enough tea for 'cause you could have low T. T. S. H. I've seen this happen the TSA just low but your thyroid still making a normal T. three\nOr four um your thyroid makes about Ninety seven percent tea for which is the hormone that then is sent to deliver it makes about seven percent a T. three\nSo the key for sent to the liver and converted into liver to T. three that's really what you want the active form\nSo the tea for again is made in the thyroid\nA Ninety percent of or or Ninety three percent of everything that is made from the thyroid is tee four and then that sent to the liver and in the liver converts the tea for into the T. three they called the tea for the in active it doesn't uh it's it's not active at all\nAnd deliver has an enzyme that will take one of the the foreign through your eyes down molecules so it takes one of the iodine molecules off of it and it becomes active now it's T. three\nAnd that's the active portion but if you could have a thyroid what appears to be a thyroid issue but it's really a liver issue you could over convert of the tea foreign make too much T. three\nYou could under convert or the T. three ... you can have enough tea for but not making enough T. three the T. three is what goes out for your metabolism and your immune system so it helps in that area too\nSo there's all kinds of things that are going on besides just looking at your T S H um so you want that ts age to be in a functional range of one point eight to three if it's out of that range there's a problem and we have to handle it functionally with nutrition\nSo here's some symptoms that you may or may not be aware of that uh happened when your thyroid isn't working and we're talking about hypo thyroid or sluggish thyroid is slowing down of course you're going to be fatigued and tired you could sleep all weekend long and and you're still tired it doesn't matter how much sleep you get\nIt's irrelevant how much sleep you get you will always be tired when your thyroid is is a sluggish\nUm you'll have general weight gain your you'll start gaining weight evenly distributed throughout the throughout the body or you're not you're not getting that pot belly necessarily you don't get to spare tire you just gaining weight in general\nAre over time you're going to get sagging skin underneath the arms or maybe the chin or the midsection because what's happening is your body isn't metabolizing and it needs minerals your body has one purpose and that is to survive\nAnd if it can't ah find those vitamins and minerals guess what it's gonna take it from somewhere and it'll start taking it out from underneath the arms or in the mid section a your body doesn't care about elasticity if it can't find the minerals and it takes a lot of minerals to run the thyroid that the second most\nUh uh nutrition that comes up to fix the thyroid his minerals we use one called organically bum mineral [noise]\nPour appetite you're starting to lose your appetite you're craving\nBreads pasta chocolates this week [noise] um [noise] and that's because you don't have enough energy slowing down [noise]\nAll right we're going to take another break we'll come back we'll finish our some symptoms on I really didn't maybe get into the ... portion of this and I'll tell you what that means no it is not a car\nI write issue [noise]\nThe salvation army is on the ground across the state of Florida and the Gulf Coast serving those impacted by hurricane Michael with generous public support the salvation army can provide immediate relief with things like food hydration shelter hygiene\nKits and emotionally spiritually care to contribute to the salvation army hurricane disaster relief effort visit Salvation Army dot listening give dot org one hundred percent of the designated gifts will be used and supportive those affected by hurricane Michael\nAre veterans were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life [noise] let them know we are joined me as a pro supporter of our veterans [noise] Hi this is Joe Montana and on the one hundredth anniversary of Veterans Day help no vet alone improve the lives of\nThose who have served our country\nPlease show your support and text V.

the body needs and that's what it needs to heal\nAnd that's what we're missing in our society as far as trying to stay healthy or we we're supposed to have the number one health care in the world well if that was true would have the ... the healthiest population in the world a there's a thing called the industrial health index\nAnd there's something like fifty two different countries that are rated or their populations rated on where their health is and guess what we're number forty two were far far from being number one which we should be that's because we don't have health care in America\nWhere we have is a disease care in other words you're fine everything's okay until you get diagnosed with a disease now you have a disease we can cut it out we can burn it out or we can medicated\nAll right that is not health care what we do in my office is we catch those things and a lot of cases would catch them before they become a disease if you want to stay healthy you want to get healthy you're gonna have to learn how to do that\nUh we live in a toxic environment now you know the days of just going around eating what you want to eat and staying healthy are over with\nOr you can no longer eat food to get healthy now don't get me wrong once you're healthy you got to eat healthy to stay healthy but you're going to have to know what to eat what not to eat or these people that come to my office they're getting a educated on\nHow to handle these things um you know people can go out and have a say a cake or if they're going to celebrate a birthday or something like that and not feel guilty about it there's a way to reset the thermostat so that uh\nYou can overcome those things but you got to know what to do and how to do it and that's what happens in my office when somebody comes in and they get a program and I run tests that no other doctors are running why they don't run them don't ask me a there functional tests they find out things like ah do you have a inflammation on a cellular level\nOr are you having do you have toxins attaching to the nerves of your eyes\nAre are you dropping into that low gear these are the things that we are concerned about functionally oh we also run blood tests and do all the standard a blood test but even the blood tests we look at a completely different or we look at it through functional ranges not laboratory ranges\nSo we take things that might be considered okay in medicine and we look at it and we say hey that's not okay it's heading in the wrong direction and will correct it with nutrition\nOr you know a lot of doctors are especially on the radio or TV the talk a good story and then you go to their office and uh you don't get any nutrition you get a little bit of nutrition like hey there's a small little shelf over their help yourself\nA no in my office we have we got a a ten foot by ten foot room just packed full of nutrition\nUm I wished I didn't have to handle it but this all professional nutrition so\nYou can't buy this on the Internet you can't buy it down at a Walgreens we're talking about professional whole food nutrition unfortunately most people don't know there's a difference between what you buy at Walgreens Wal Mart or any other place those are called nutritious food uh goals are made in the laboratory we are talking about real food that comes out of the ground\nOh that's what the body needs to heal repair and stay healthy\nNow if you want to know more about that a information you need to come to my workshop you know we got one coming up this Tuesday at six thirty October\nSixteen and we got another one uh Saturday it won't be this coming Saturday it'd be the following Saturday October the seventh\nSo if you want to come to either one of those just call my office six one five three three three zero zero five six six one five three three three zero zero five six\nAll right we're going back to our subject here and we were talking about the thyroid we were going over symptoms that occur when your thyroid goes hypo or sluggish\nOr in other words is not a functioning or like as opposed to a slowing down and out one of them that we ended off on before the break there was depression now here's a scenario I see quite a bit\nOf the person is trying to help themselves they go out and they go to their general practitioner and they say hey what do I need to do to get healthy and the general practitioner usually tells them to things eat less and exercise well without any guidance or very little guidance they're out there doing that on their own uh they don't uh\nUh they're not they're not getting the results that they want after a few weeks or a few months ago back in for a follow up and they say look I've been eating less I exercise I really don't feel that much difference and I feel depressed well guess what the next step is from there yes antidepressants\nAre I'm sure that doctor had a good heart wanted to help that person but unfortunately this is physical depression now when you come to my workshop we give you a handout of sixty different physical depressions things that are physically wrong\nWith you that manifest as depression there it's not depression it's something physically going on it's called physical depression\nSo the thyroid will mimic that\nAnd the person thinks they're depressed\nOr and then they get on antidepressants and that's a whole nother story\nUh so uh what we want to do is make sure that we can handle the thyroid and once that I write gets better than of the symptoms of depression will go away a thyroid people also have a hard time making a decision believe me I see this all the time especially when they come to the workshop\nUh cause I give him an offer at the end of the workshop they can come in and they can uh get a two hour initial evaluation which is normally three hundred and forty eight dollars they can get that for a hundred and sixty five if they come to the workshop which is less than half price\nA and they're going to spend two hours in my office and we're going to figure out what's going on with them and they have a hard time making the decision so I wrote people have a difficult time in making a decision if you have a difficult time and making decisions\nSo I'm so that's what we teach that's part of the program this part of what we do not only give you supplements but actually teach you\nAre on how to handle this you know when I when I look at somebody or in their purchasing a program I look at that as tuition they're buying education they're buying knowledge and at the end of it or they'll know how to handle their condition [noise]\nAll right so I I wanted I Want to let you know one more time that we're going to have a workshop and that workshop is coming up this Tuesday as short notice and we got two days but Tuesday evening if you're available you need to be at this workshop\nIt's October the sixteenth it's totally free we're going to go over things like the thyroid the adrenal as the ovaries or we'll go over the best way to exercise and we'll go over all a lot of stuff but the whole purpose is to get you healthy\nUm uh so we got one coming up this Saturday it's going to be at six thirty PM or just call my office six one five three three three zero zero\nFive six that's three three three zero zero five six or if you can't make the Tuesday one star signing up for the next Saturday one won't be this coming Saturday it'll be the following Saturday the twenty seventh\nThat one starts at ten am most people can make that one but that one starts at ten AM so is this coming Saturday October the uh uh twenty seven and a I have to just call the same number six one five three three three zero zero\nFive six uh six one five three three three zero zero five six and just tell him which one you want to come to Tuesday night or a Saturday\nEither one that's totally free will be very glad that you did a there is no high pressure sales techniques or anything like that don't worry about that matter of fact when you call the uh that number I gave you nobody's even gonna answer at the other end of the phone or ... it's a voice mail so just leave your name and number\nAnd ah you're going to learn so many things that you've never heard before\nAnd if you take action on it it's going to transform your life\nAll right we were talking about the ... with ... you can have a thyroid issue and how she motives but you got to look at these a separate issues even though the kind of get lumped in together and with ... they don't know why it turns on and they don't know why it turns off\nBut eighty to Ninety percent of your immune system's your digestion\nSo there are certain tools and strategies that we will teach you on how to handle that and how to clean up the digestive system so that we have a chance at least to shut the a ... down or shut it off\nBut with ... models you can have a lot of those symptoms that we already talked about\nPlus you have this nervousness or ... you don't know why you're nervous or jittery just do for some reason\nUh you can get night sweats so if you suspect you have a thyroid problem you have night sweats and a you've never been checked for ... might be a good idea to get checked now there's two ... two antibodies you have to run\nTo get checked for the ... or check it in the blood once called the T. P. O.\nThat'd be Tom Peter Oscar PPO and a body\nOr the T. G. and body Tom George and a body T. G. anti body you have to run both of those now a lot of doctors a well run one comes back negative but if they ran both of them one of them would come back positive so you always have to run both of those because one could be negative and the other one positive\nSo the tea peel and a body and the T. G. anti bodies what you want to run their not an expensive test if you went through my office I think it's like forty eight dollars to run those\nAre in the in the testing world that is cheap\nYou've probably spent thousands and thousands of dollars on testing and look what got you where you're at today you or your insurance I did that so uh forty eight dollar test that's nothing I'm so but we check it on everybody that comes through my office we check it on a standard like um\nThey don't check it in medicine because there's no medicine for it so why would they check it\nAll right so how how she motives were going to get some nervousness we're going to maybe have night sweats heart palpitations you get this racing heart for some reason it seems to be like it's in the afternoon or evening mostly\nA if that happens long enough frequently enough guess what the person thinks they're having an anxiety attack and ah do end up in the doctors or at the ER and guess what they get anti anxiety medicine\nOr that ... doesn't stop at a hundred percent but now that's a whole nother issue a these are psychotropic drugs they never fix anything and they actually damage receptor sites in your brain that is why they're hard to get off of them\nAre also internal tremors I had a lady come in a while ago she said to her ... her intestinal track it felt like it was vibrating is what she said\nAnd I said all internal tremors and she says well you could say that\nAnd uh she was on medication for her thyroid she had high profile road she had it for Twenty years and nobody ever check to see if she had how she models well I checked it and sure enough came back positive for how she models and guess what we were able to handle that with nutrition and stop the internal tremors for her\nSo once we are no you have ... than we know that we're going to have to get some deep um healing going on like getting getting down on that so your level again and getting rid of\nToxins a heavy metals a toxin center in the environment chemicals are they're all in there [noise] so so when we're dealing\nWith a thyroid we always have to rule in or rule out the ... ah there's two antibodies that we do that with the tea piano and a body and the PG and a body\nMost everybody or I should say not most eighty percent of everybody that has thyroid issues also has how she models unfortunately most eighty percent of the people that have I wrote a horseshoe motives don't even know they have ...\nProbably never even heard of it before because it never gets checked\nA never gets checked because there's no medicine for it most doctors that check your thyroid our medical doctors or doctors I call them disease doctors are trained in diseases looking to see if your thyroid is in a disease state\nOr they don't check how she motors because there's no medicine for so why would they run a test or just to run a test they run test to change the standard of your care and that's the same reason I run tests to change the standard of\nCare [noise] All right well I hear that music coming on and I do want to remind you we do have to workshops one on Tuesday this coming Tuesday six dirty October the ... the next one will be Saturday a at ten am October the twenty seventh just call six one five three three three zero zero five\nNext let me know which which I didn't want to come

a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nA vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well and so they go and\nWhat we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting phone line is you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest\nIt wow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nThe calcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down this great absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nOr I this is probably a good time folks if you want

to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break into where you have a real noticeable thing than right to their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you know to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] not your bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the transmitters and the nerve\nAnd when you take us combat formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back in ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I Would functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period and it it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this count max formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nArthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body being hernia could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough she was the one who took a week of ah the formula that ... formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer making it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes you than us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles work in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medications that many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium may need them in the system so that very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because the fish and in many of them\nIt's also

type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd documenting is why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country\nAre deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and it's not there and the statistics show that back in the Seventy two on when he started getting cable networks and of course with the Internet and we're not going outside\nAnd most of us get no vitamin D from sun what\nMakes your fast smelled the three formula a much better choice\nOh Chris first of all I put five thousand units of vitamin D three per serving in each tablet can actually feel the difference second I use the right type of vitamin D and my formula and third I've worked with in advance team of scientists

G. M. P. certified lab which means current good manufacturing practices\nAnd this is an FDA mandated set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently the FDA came in and did an infection\nAnd they said hey guys keep up the good work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your fast smelled the three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWhile diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin in the body but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D three does it taste that problem\nAnd it seems to fix it now they've studied vitamin D three and it didn't prove this insulin it sure by sixty percent and just to give it a comparison the most popular diabetic Dr\nImprove the Thirteen percent\nWow now let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast smelled these three

automatic monthly subscription programs this is a one time order so I encourage you the number to call is one eight hundred\nFor seven six five six three zero I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for seven six five six three zero so\nHow about if folks to me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end as going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts might have been the formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and the unity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men the men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn it on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is\nVery very important ... people in their forties that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you'd start killing her you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning mhm\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on to the formula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done and\nClarity you know this is more and more important as we go along because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pick is such that your fast melt the three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath of the mirror in the morning then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like that and the sooner you can get on my formula the better eyes you're going to have of having a really\nHealthy high energy high mobility life from here I Know\nYeah well it makes a lot of sense and documenting just looking someone expect when they start taking your ass melts the three formula\nYou're going to notice within the first several days that something changing in your body because the kick start so many different cycles when your body that you'll start having less pain having more energy\nAnd having better mental clarity better sleep your mood can be affected by this vitamin D three is necessary to

W. B. C. mortgage and here we are in the middle\nOf August I've been seeing lots of kids going back to school and Greg you've just moved in yours into college you know we've got to go get a puppy\nOh you guys must happy or no as a puppy up because he's gone now either gone or replaced it with the oh [laughter] um well I haven't done that yet but I Do a next\nWeek I take um I've got one senior in high school but he is playing for his first time away with hockey and then um my oldest um is playing in the north American League so there will be some crocodile tears from this um and then a week I Know we've had a great summer though and\nI still see them pretty much um weekends because I'm a hockey mom through and through so\nI'm a before the break we were talking about\nUm are we in another housing bubble and I do think this is really the buzz around the country right now um if you look at\nThe different markets especially the big on metro cities um of what's going on there\nUm how I like to look at it and it's definitely a debate um one thing you can say really not Ford is the new the last recession the license bubble came at two thousand seven ... right and and that's\nTen years ago and usually every ten years there is some sort of correction that's just the numbers that it's just if you look at the graphs as the way it works or\nAnd but one of the key metrics that really goes through this is home prices so we do see we we say oh you know home prices are going up I mean that's a lot of what we talk especially here locally will talk about that\nBut if you look at the facts on according to a quarter logic they reported the U.S median cells prize in June two thousand six was two hundred and forty seven thousand one hundred and ten dollars\nCompared to Marge two thousand Eighteen was two hundred and Thirteen thousand four hundred was the median price across America\nSo if you look at that there's not the inflation is not now that was two thousand six was right before everything crash or you know the the bubble hid 'em which then we knew it was coming to I I mean we always say well we know it's coming but what do you do we just kept going\nYeah right [laughter] but here we are they're so home prices can be debated now let's talk here locally ... of just really ... we don't have X. we're talking to the facts that we know dealing with the industry every day there are parts of town that has definitely sky rocketed and cost\nBut why have they because we were so low on inventory you know new construction comes in which we needed but it it does cost money to build home there and so you know I had a home that was a new construction that took a while it was it beautiful and it was in\nA hot part of Franklin it took a while to get under contract and people were like it's over priced at ... ... it was priced out according to what it cost to build and it was just it's more expensive to build land is more expensive now\nBut when you look at those prices and they're still gauge off of cops and really what's happening here locally so what's your take on it\nI was at a function last night and this guy he he asked me you know what's my take on it [noise] and I'm asked him about his situation and he bought a home for short term rentals\nAnd it was a tear down and he paid out on our Web let's call it seven or fifty thousand for it and now it's not legal for him to sell them at home as a short term rental home\nAnd he's looking at values now instead of the seven fifty because there's a lot of homes that look like is that we're purchase for that reason\nAnd he's looking at maybe six fifty on the market because it's no longer it can no longer be a short term I Try and put it there was a lot of homes built like that for that one purpose why a lot of like minded people\nSo that's a that's an unusual pocket that were ... that that's a natural that you know it's not tested yet really water it's with what's going to happen to a lot of those homes that look like that with a lot of buyers that looked like those buyers\nI don't know I mean if if a lot of them start putting them on the market that is going to be great because it's going to help out or anything to worry about the same time if a lot of them put on the market simultaneously\nUm that'll correct so I think you're going to have pockets of correction in some areas where people just went a little bit hot and and then we'll come back we're as we might not see that same thing happen and you know and no one's\nRight well you definitely without the low end and tore right and so it started the new construction right and then you started investors pouring in and buying which now you've got calm switching up prices\nSo I mean it's it's just a very different market I Do not think it's the same market is two thousand six but there's definitely areas of softening and we see that because ... is the price matters in this market I never dealt with the market that price matters as much as\nI feel like it matter I now if you're home is overpriced it sits ... and it just does not and you know it's and that's what the consumer say and we feel it we see it and Greg you and not talk all the time on this and we see and as soon as it is that a correct price\nWhile the the voice of NASA Lewis show I'm very dire in Studio with me is Frank and accepted BBC market\nAnd we're talking about all the oil is say if you have a ... should be sure to give me a text said six\nOne five to three two forty three hundred we're talking about our market um what is really um all over the headlines are are we headed towards another housing bubble\nA we've looked at fourteen metrics and really debating each of them and I feel like I'm definitely we are in a different market um things are nothing do like they were in two thousand six and I'm totally different\nUm I Do think price matters in this market and I do think you need to be smart in any situation in really gather all the facts we do have homes that when they are price correctly and they are staged and they're gone yes they are selling quickly\nAnd we love that but we also see those homes that are sitting out there on the market but usually\nNow say usually when I go look at um there's a definite reason and it may simply just the is price and the main\nUm again price matters so home prices as they've won\nWe've spent some time talking about mortgage on I Am thrilled with the mortgage options that we have of today on overall do grade do you see more people taking the lesser downpayment um options are are you still see in ten Fifteen twenty percent down\nIt depends on you know the person's age where they are financially I'm the more you put down the cheaper your product your mortgage insurance industry trying to be\nBut I Would say a younger generation doesn't have the savings a lot of times and so they're wanting a hundred percent financing which is out there ... all too many people in certain income categories\nAnd that's that's something that used to not be around here I mean I think the biggest ... you know even gosh five to ten years ago the biggest hardship of buying a house as what the down payment\nYeah yeah and so if you're the key number that if you can like you're listening out there and you're trying to think of well okay what\nWhat's an amount of money that I can put in to really benefit me well three percent I mean if you can think of three if you can find a way to save three percent of your sales price ... there's some great incredible programs out there for you\nThat will keep your mortgage insurance somewhat lower than a hundred percent loan and your interest rate better\nAnd that price point you would need to stay with them as what\nWell at three percent down the maximum Lawrence like four hundred and Ninety four thousand um but I mean a lot of yeah [laughter] yeah\nThat is and sang right but that has increased it has yeah yeah for sure so\nOn said three percent down okay foreclosure rates on of course a big key metric when you're looking at are we in trouble is how many foreclosures now my entire business from two thousand seven to really\nEarly two thousand eleven was foreclosures and that's all I did come on and\nOn foreclosures in short cells I it it they are almost nonexistent and I mean we we have those accounts and we do work some but they are nowhere and I mean they're they're like I said if I have\nTwo closings among unfolding in luxury that's like a big mutt now where in the ...\nUs there will be thirty to forty closing so it was a big difference so definitely I'm not seeing that here locally and I can't speak for the United states on that but overall I Do know the numbers say they are extremely low across the nation because of course and that's why if you look at\nThe investors there's always been investors investors are still buying things that they're buying different type things because back you know two thousand seven to two thousand ten\nThey did buy the foreclosure property now they're buying as you said on the other like short term rentals on things to convert condos to convert into rental properties or you know there's different ways or commercially the men have really gone back here from\nThe um ... what we're talking about on the brake too is that I'm fifty eight percent of millennials claim that at home purchases\nBeing the best decision and they can make is down um it's it's fifty percent of them think that it's a good decision which is actually the lowest it's been in the last two quarters\nMeaning that quarter after quarter the millennial is more and more disenfranchised and um you know I think it's just interesting to me that a statistic that thirty two percent of them claim that they are not able to buy a house do to not being able to save enough money due to their diet [laughter]\nDietary yeah so we've got some healthy millennial three\nPercent of them have not been able to save that three percent down because they have a ... you know why\nThey want to eat healthy but they want to go out to eat and they want a house right oh they're like trying to balance and they want the house to be in an urban area the shake him last hired by the store and out of their twelve dollar ... lifestyles and ... and\nWe can lie laugh about it but it is very true I had a just a day for twelve dollars an hour and you're now you're going to cut back you got to cut back on your house is actually getting that\nUm that no you know those things are expensive and if that's the lifestyle that they are seeking I mean the sushi that you are at a I mean ... ... and\nThey eat out at nice you know really cool fun places that I Love to go myself and it's expensive as\nWell we are seeing 'em\nWhen I said is different is that change it's a change with our new consumer and although we have all generations we sell to of course\nYou we still always go back to the largest generation is now in their thirties and that is the millennials right I mean that so we've got this huge\nPopulation that you know they think and want ...\nDifferently you know and when it comes to housing\nThat the previous generations have started I say that now I've got a lot of my baby boomers are now becoming empty nesters and they're on the millennial wagon to LA like that lifestyle as well so um you know we do see we see it all out there but to your point it's a different market ... on\nI'm not quite ready to say we're in a bubble for me I'm just not because things are selling they are marketed as good we do have people moving here\nI Will say totally different market though eggs and I agree with everything on well in the last thing comes down to housing affordability right\nYou know and that still debated really across all metro cities because before your Nashville in ... how many people really or just desiring to live downtown now is just booming and the prices are booming too\nBut so much of that is being in a awesome city sure you know you you look at Denver downtown it's great for the prices downtown are high tissue or you know a Minneapolis I mean the big cities you know we'd only one time about the California prices but again so we do see\nLess housing affordability downtown Nashville\nBut when you do talk about a Ford ability you can certainly go out the parts of summer county you can go to rather for you can go to Marie I mean there are areas that are extremely affordable\nBut then you know we didn't talk about commute times sure so on that and definitely a huge debate here locally and a debate across the country\nI'm I'm helping her family came from Los Angeles and we compared with compared for me the cost of living differences\nAnd they're retiring and it's almost double their income that they're getting you know after expenses after not having to pay state income tax not having to pay\nYou know all the different things they're literally having more two times the disposable income in Nashville and that was their number one\n... they're coming from California so yes that come out west they come from a newer and ... you know so I Do think it's where\nYou're coming to love locally in your mind said thank you so much for tune in and today we're here again to answer any questions you may have regarding all things real estate thank you see you next Sunday and God Bless [noise]\nHead nurse in vale Nashville\nYou were talking about I mean I [noise]\nMatter whether\nYou're born whether I never have but I think it's sort of Democrats if you want to know the first\nIn an interview airing on sixty minutes tonight President Trump said he is I'm sure how long defense secretary Jim Mattis planning to stay in his administration\nWould get along very well way may leave I mean at some point everybody laughs\nCorresponded ... Sanchez says the Pentagon has issued a statement on Trump's remarks\nQuote Secretary Mattis is laser focused on doing his job ensuring that the United states military remains the most lethal force on the planet\nDone something earlier right now six one five\nEight one two three to a coach out his messed up six one five eight one two oh two three to four four regulated six one five three one to talk to somebody and see I mean obviously we're not just how it's still hard in my feelings right there I was so focused on what I was trying to teach you I forgot the numbers and by the way you can actually\nHelp with your some of your memory tuna and that's not a good representative LT three sixty when you forget that goes but I can tell you this right now we want to see you we want to help yeah we want to be a part of your life we want to really help you merely physically and emotionally maybe even drop some of your history so that you can get into your destiny\nSo come to one of our pre helping a lot of seminars meet me meet our team made our staff we'd love to help you\nAnd love to see how we can walk this trail with you\nWell let's talk about all about timing of that whole thing 'cause you know what we're now and October ...\nWe are a few weeks away from what we would uh having rain and I said extended\nAmerican celebration culture\nYou know we're going to have a a Halloween at the end of October and a lot of people just think hey it's your Thanksgiving and Christmas when they sometimes think holiday when you think about the celebrations that people are having\nIt begins with it in the end of October with Halloween\nWere into Thanksgiving were then into holiday office parties we got Christmas we got New Year's eve we got New Year's day we got the Superbowl we've got a you know we end up maybe get a little break after Valentine's Day in February but you're thinking October through February we got a lot of stuff hitting us and so sometimes people get in that\nIn that role in that in mind that mental thing that\nYou know what hey we're getting ready to hit the holidays you know I I might as well just kind of wait till maybe started a new year well we'll talk about tiny talked and you know well what would you say a person who's who's who's who's thinking that way and they think about that year after year this great\nThis is a great point that you make because most people will put off their health or you know just because there's some event coming up or some celebration coming up or without but let me just share this with you there's always going to be a Christmas there's always going to be a Halloween there's always going to be a Thanksgiving is always going to be an anniversary there's always going to be a birthday party\nListen if you if you guys think that I'm Out there eating seeds and grass\nAnd and hey every day to ... to stay healthy that's not the truth although my kids have a birthday party I have a piece of birthday cake with them if my kids how to celebrate and my wife and outgoing anniversary dinner we're going to have a nice meal but we know how to do it the right way and were healthy now so that our bodies can process to metabolize the food the right way and we don't have to worry about sabotaging\nOurselves and and just just a waking up you know like we're in a coma situation so well again one of the things I always want to encourage ... or encourage you to think about is don't wait on your health\nThere's always an excuse that you can have to put something in front of your health and most people don't even consider are way the cost of what it is until something catastrophic happens and I'm telling you right now you don't have to wait to do that\nNow you're down because really the time is now one thing all the three sixty teaches each one of our clients is just how to navigate through those that are 'cause I've read a couple of studies one study is that uh\nIt's very likely very common a person could gain eight to ten pounds during this time of year alone or in another study I read is or if they do only gain one to two pounds a year and it's one of the two pounds it never leave\nAnd if you're talking to one to two pounds every year that never leave sooner or later that's going to catch up with you so uh it's called the gift that keeps on giving [laughter] so that time is definitely now and it's just you know no don't ever think that are used as you're talking about your house\nThat you just you know you're always kind of put you know that's really some of the things that we're hearing here from our own clients that came in and said one thing they say all the time as well I Wish I Would have done this in her\n... and again there's never there's never too late until it's too late\nSo act on yourself right now be your best to be your best coach be your best to value waiter and make the decision to do something you know we always talk about there's plenty of options out there\nWe had we provide a unique option because we provide to structure accountability and the coaching\nA and we also provide something that's invaluable to most people and that's a community and if you have all four of those ingredients you much more likely to be successful long term and again oh wait wait studies all weight loss study is all helping a lot of studies that I've ever read\nIncorporate the the these four things structure accountability coaching and community and if you don't have that\nThen most of the time what you're going to do is when when life gets tough for you get out of routine get out of habit you'll go back to the old comfort foods the old comfort habits the old they'll they'll used to say I should say and then when you do that many times you become disappointed because you find yourself in a situation where you were before you started\nSo come get one of our free seminars we got him in Brentwood weekend and Murfreesboro we got an men bill good luck to fill a you know we got 'em all over the hill Tennessee and if that didn't work for you will get you in for an individual consul at six one five three one two eight to four four give us a call and speaking of clients who got special guests tonight or I'll let you introduce him\nCoach oh I'm so excited about this because this is not only one of our clients but we had a new partnership with northwestern mutual and again I'm ... I'm On that Greg Greg runners are transfer of the week and a millennium share a little bit about his experience with us\nBut we avenues sponsor coach for our show I I a team of of just incredible people a credible teammates\nAnd I cannot be more excited about this opportunity for this new partnership with north western I'm all that Greg talked talk a little bit about that but before that let me bring him to the microphone so everybody can meet Greg Brenner So Greg Brenner welcome to the tea three sixty coaches they'll show I appreciated coach Scott\nTalk to us now let's go back to the beginning you've you've been with us now do you you and I have a several things in common uh but the most important thing that we have in common is that we both have six children that is accurate and so you know that children can be a a very challenging but also the ultimate blessing in life\nIs to pass onto the next generation so that you're not a generational thief\nOr the time that you spend with your children and grandchildren and so it was one of my great motivators to get healthy when the day when my wife told me that some of the man was going to walk my daughter's down the aisle when I thought I was having a heart attack in my backyard\nOr but talk to us a little bit about how you heard about is the first time you met us when you came to a seminar that take us back to those early stages what was your what was your why\nAm I why I'm was basically a posting thing that you experience my father a biological dad died at fifty four years old of a heart attack at no previous symptoms hundred and Seventy five pounds ... been in the military and um went fishing one morning came home went to bed and never will back up\nAnd you know six children like you I'm kind of same thing on my I've got that uh cholesterol gene that's been in my family for a long time and\nAt that point I was really thinking you know I Want to be there for my younger children more calm down all my daughter's either when I graduated in ... grandchildren and great grandchildren\nAnd if I did not address these familial issues of cholesterol and that bad a heart gene then ah that wasn't going to happen and so I I've known him for a while back when you were coaching CPA when our kids were there and I'm really saw your passion for coaching and then my wife house and actually said hey\nGo chose fault is doing the kind of a health and wellness type program now Greg you ought to go check it out we'll see what he's doing and I went to the seminar Alison came with me\nAnd her ... story and the passion and like you said earlier you didn't need the closely on it you didn't twisted my arm I thought this was the day that God put me in front of you in this program because I needed it\nAnd um it's really where we join a that evening and it's been phenomenal ever since I had a little set back with a back surgery from a from a injury in the military so up in one of the coaches come back after me a little bit and so I'm kind of back on the program and good and feeling better\nSo let's talk about that let's talk about some of those intangibles some of the things that you were seeking and some of the things that you you won't it for your own life and how L. T. three sixty has been able to provide some of that as at least a game plan for you to get there\n[noise] yeah well one is you know even in financial services ... he's the same thing of accountability in habit and structure and community and have a personal financial coach and uh so that was the first thing I was looking for is\nYou know we're living in this society now where knowledge is not the issue always it's the discipline and um the perseverance kind of a achieve things and so I Love the personal coaching that I've received for your um you know kind of keeps me on track but more importantly\nCoach Scott I'm One of the above father about her husband a like a probably a lot of men out there right now they're working you know working their tails off providing for their families I got home for thirty five six o'clock at night I was dead\nAnd I love coach and my kids in sports and I started finding excuses not to do that because I have absolutely no energy and um you know my my relationship with the house and my wife was paying a price my children were paying the price and so the intangible that I recognize very quickly\nWas the energy level just have a sustainable day and give all of myself at work at home with Allison spiritually professionally\nAnd that was the biggest thing I've noticed in relatively quickly we were really within a few months or I just really noticed that spike in energy and that just at a conference\nAnd you know we're talking about a few a few months coached\nSo that's this is a few months for the new year so this is a great opportunity to get in here and let's get you to the real you before the\nNew year ... [noise] yeah no question so again you can call that number six one five three one two eight to four for that six one five three one two to four for visits on line at\nW. W. W. dot L. C. three sixty dot com catches on Facebook and we will be back with healthy three sixty coaches show with our guest Craig Venter right after the break [noise]\nAccurate mortgage good wants to know that being frightened of goblins or goals makes a lot more sense than being scared of the home loan process no matter if\nThat's one of the things we do it out to three sixty we really teach you and educate shown how to do this where you're not having to\nYou know eat a nuts and ... sticks and twigs all day and thank you are getting healthy a lot of people think that's what you gotta do to be healthy and that's the farthest from the truth you know you can go to normal grocery stores you can learn how to read food labels you can learn how to stay away from some of the toxic stuff that's out there and really you know there's a lot of there's a lot of food manufacturers right now they're having a\nPush to more organic more whole food\nAre more certified you know I'm just again that you know you're talking about the pesticides that they put in the crops and so forth there's so many you know good companies out there right now that are making a push to get our food cleaner\nOr and so again you can live out of the grocery store you should be able to live out in the grocery store 'cause most people don't have the luxury or to do that and we can help you do that we can show you exactly how to get healthy at a Seder level\nBy doing it real or what you is using ruined eating real food\nWithout hating the process killing yourself or being radical and by the way that so that was the five barriers to my success long years ago when I tried to get healthy I tried to lose weight I was overweight or obese I was fat\nOr I was unhealthy I was unhappy I didn't have the energy I didn't sleep well didn't wake up arrested the barriers for me was was the fatigue\nYou know I'd already tried to so many programs weight watchers Jenny Craig neutral system Atkins juicing pills powders potions lotion\nPeanut any X cross that most of the confusion interval training beach body body for law give me keep going Kojak and get going all day I got the idea of why they call me up and let me go but I could do there's so many things out there that are keeping us in preventing us but I really boils down to five barriers what are the barriers was that I couldn't do another program that started me\nAnd if you're doing if you're on a program right now or if you're on a diet right now that is keeping use those are hungry all day long because and that was a secondary being hungry all the time\nBut if you're restricting your calories so much and you're fatigue and your body and you're putting your body and starvation mode or you're not going to get healthy and it very best is going to be a temporary fix yeah you may lose some weight 'cause you're starving yourself but you don't need to do that and the third barrier was I didn't want anybody telling me that I had to take away all my favorite foods\nThat's discouraging that's that's disheartening you know when you go to our anniversary or or Super Bowl party or a New Year's eve party are your kids have a birthday party or you know you want to be able to eat real food you want to be live normal life you don't want to eat out of a bag your whole life and so you know and ... do you take your your your lunch to work every day which we admire about you but\nSometimes people got to eat on the road sometimes people got to eat out\nAnd you need to know how to do that just like you need to eat out of a bag so again one of the things that we are going to teach us how to do this the right way without being radical\nWithout hating yourself and you know being angry all the time of my wife cause of angry hungry and angry mixed and we got a hungry and an angry woman at the same time you better watch out because that's that's not a safe place debate coaches and that's because you got to go to sleep\nSometimes you've got to go to sleep or and so we just always want to encourage you to look at your health differently or the other barrier was you don't need to be doing something that's going to cause you to be tired all the time\nAnd if you restrict your calories so much and let's say that you take all your you strip all your carbs out of your diet or put to try to put your body into a steady ... now that will work for a while for some people and you lose some weight\nBut I guarantee you you know you're going to run the risk of shutting your metabolic rate down you're going to run the risk of really really blowing yourself back up and shutting some of the metal the essential functions in your body\nOr the chemical reactions in your body levels of serotonin doping me now to protect and all those the the ... you can get those out of balance in those hormones that a balance very very quickly uh and and again and then the final thing was I didn't want to do something that I couldn't do for the rest of my life\nAnd so if you don't create a different lifestyle for you if you don't understand how the how the body works together if you don't understand body systems let us help you let a show you how to do that in fact we can do it we can we can get you started for free for free you can come in and get a free personal consultation a free bio scan a free health risk assessment\nAnd we can help you all the way as far as we can ah and then you can decide for yourself if it's right for you\nAre and we got a coach standing by right now that's what tonight's a little bit different because we've we've had so many people said I I listen to your show on Sundays and I want to call somebody but I Know nobody's there I Want to talk to somebody and so we have made it available we have put one of our staff\nOwn notice and so six one five eight one five zero three nine zero six one five one five zero three nine zero we've got a coach standing by right now you can talk with them on the phone you can tell them what your issues are\nHe can try to help you through through the process of the phone or you can set up at a time to meet with me personally\nAnd I'll go over a program with you step by step and show you exactly what I what we recommend for you and how would work for you to get you help you out a cellular level while we nurture you the whole person mind body and spirit\nOf so much as you talk about the related to people's relationship with food ah you know again in our culture were always kind of bombarded by less is better lessons that are less is better and but then you can kick that uh our bodies into starvation kind of a mode where when you're doing something like that that is so restrictive\nA you know the body wants to hold on and I don't really want to release the fact that it's designed for survival so it's going to try to help you\nDo the right thing but then you get those people when they come in yeah they're going to happen most of our culture Ninety Ninety five percent of people I think that come to us or are looking to lose that weight because they had access body fat but uh\nThen you have most most that culture thinking well what what can what is a good amount for me which is what we give them and they're kind of surprised they're not hungry but that if they would just think about it well you're taking all these calories in and if you're getting access to buy ... is just storing it is not using but in their mind\nIt's kinda like well you know it's how somehow all being used but uh but it's really not so it's really about their relationship with food and a lot of ways as part of a wider and healthy at this time\nWell think about it like this because that's a great point I think about it like this um you know let's say that we're we're office together and we're we're we're we're getting work done and all of a sudden somebody brings in a um a let's just say they're bringing a dozen Krispy Kreme donuts come on somebody shout to me where I can hear you\nRight now she added it hot light comes it'll come out all multi wrecked my car a couple of times but let's say somebody brings in a dozen a hot a glazed Krispy Kreme donuts and by the way they'll take advantage of me every now and then but I don't let them get hold of me no more like I used to\nUh you know right now you when you look at that you buy oh I'm going to get one I Want one of those donut now five seconds ago before those donors came in and you went in thinking about those doughnuts\nAnd so ... that's the emotional attachment that we have with food and learning how to break those emotional attachments learning how to break those emotional eating habits and learning how to stay in control none of that doesn't mean you don't get one or don't have\nOne it just means that you're in control in other words it's not pulling you so far into that situation where you can't get out of it in less you want to and so the great news is that we have a system that's going to teach you and educates you and help you with this\nAh and again we can help you overcome so many areas of your life but we got to talk to you first\nAnd we've got to make sure that you know what you're doing so that we can educate you how to get healthier to say the level\nAt our coach right now six one five eight one five zero three nine zero standing by right
