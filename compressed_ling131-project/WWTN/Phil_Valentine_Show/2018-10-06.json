I'm just saying consult with an attorney and again I'm not one but I Know that why you're married everything you buy while you're in a marriage can be considered fifty fifty or something like that I'm not married forever\nOr just be careful on that but as far as the tax thing you're going to be married filing separately probably if you stay separately even if you don't fully divorced by the end of the year twenty Nineteen would probably be single\nAnd I would make sure it'll change if you're if you work in a real job I Would I Would probably change my withholding to single and zero because right now you're probably claiming married and zero 'cause that's what you were\nWell I have a son that's not between her and I oh oh he's he's my only independent okay what about\nYou know change W yeah because you may not have as many deductions when you're not claiming together and it may be better for you I'm not sure you you know a head of household I Believe it's six months if you live separately and there was a child and the child live with you I think you can actually claim head of household in six months if you email me Allen I Will double check that law for you\nOkay now in the in the process of purchasing the house um\nAs far as the financial end of it goes um I'm going to be pulling some equity out of the help that we've been living in she's been living in this house for a long time and I had a prior a house that I sold in all the equity went into that house so I'm pulling some of the equity out of it\nUm to purchase this house for the down payment and\nBasically because we are married she's going to be on the title um\nBut as as far as the her claws were the equity money go\nIt's not going to or where do I look at the\n... I mean you're going to pull it down to put in it but theoretically it's tied to the other house and it's not a part of that house so that equity that you take out is not going to be tax deductible well\nWhile you're married because this would be considered a second home right I guess right this out loud so this is the second homes still liable as long as the mortgage interest combined is less than seven fifty would that be\nThe case or homes\nWould be total less than seven fifty um\nOh um no let me let me think about yes it would be watching them\nFor social two homes are less than seven fifty this would be your first and second home and theoretically it would be both your first don't yeah I think he'd still be fine\nBut um you're just the the more the the interest that you're pulling from one is going to you're just pulling the money out and use it as a down payment on the other one so that's that down payments going to go over there as far as I Know that's gonna fly just find David I'm I'm\nSorry Allen sorry David that's all right [laughter] okay um I'll email you\nYeah and I continue that detail just to make sure I've got you on the right page right okay thank you mean by All right David David there you are\nIt's going to get the question about an ... has a mother she got from his grandfather uh-huh and he decided he didn't want to go to college um ... is invested in ... on a accounts or funds\nUm he so he decided he wanted to buy a truck with the the um\nHe pulled out a Ninety eight hundred dollars out of that is it possible or is it is or it'll be on that is the only touched on the increase or on the basis for all of it\nUm it was if it didn't let me see here at Missouri contribute to was after tax dollars I Believe so you're going to pay on the gains\nInvestment income so it's going to be considered investment income so he's not paying the gains\nNo penalties\nI don't believe so but that's something you know what I'm thinking there should be a penalty because it's only designed for ... for education so I'm going to go with the idea of a penalty but if you email me unfortunately I've got to cut\n'em if you email friday at ... dot com friday a DR friday dot com I'll be more than glad to email you exactly how what he'll need to take out the you know someone's taxes might be coming in okay\n... thanks I appreciate All right this is a doctor friday show on the air any moments you can reach me at my office on Monday morning six one five three six seven oh eight one nine six one five three six seven oh wait one nine kick me out on the Web\nFriday at the our friday dot com\nAgain friday ads the our friday the outcome is my email my website is Dr friday dot com sorry Dr friday dot com\nAwesome Saturday shows\nWith your Mayo Clinic radio ... minutes dizzy and William peripheral artery disease or P.

the least trends parents least fair most biased process sees in Senate history slanted the table from the very beginning to produce their desired result\nAnd whether they had you know the kids as beneficiaries and they have various beneficiaries for their stuff in one of the things that they had in the will was that ten percent of the state was going to go to\nThe er and they have very very large state uh ten percent of the state was going to go to the it didn't go to church\nAnd I looked at it and I said you know what you got this new witty and I said the only reason I I used it was because I had to\nHave something that I could and we only use if I ever recommend nowadays it's always know loaded annuities no commission so if you hear me rip on annuities it's the vast vast vast vast vast majority of annuities out they're sold our commission based annuities with very high internal expenses you know the um it's it's ... it's very much hidden\nBut in this particular case we actually had to know loaded annuity with a huge built in ... game right ... so we're looking at going you know what and I started talking to him about what happens when you inherited a new and it\nWas last and first out you know so it's all the games have to come out first\nAnd then you've got the five year period and there is some insurance companies that tried to do it you know you can do a little bit longer you can do a distribution longer than that it's very very much controversial\nAnd there's some insurance companies don't want to mess with it they want all the money out in one year so you think about this you're talking about all those games coming out in a very short period of time driving the kids up into major Lee high income tax rates and they could be paying thirty seven percent of that money though those gains in taxes you think about it it's like that\nSo we looked at it and I says you know what you guys have this thing in your will\nThat you um this much money is going to church and I said just happens to be the assets value of this annuity\nWhat's changed beneficiary to the church\nAnd remove the church from the will and there were like we absolutely love this this is great mhm and you know that's what we ended up doing but you know a lot of times these are very bad things to inherit and\nWell yeah people don't realize is the worst a steep learning tool and their soldiers estate planning vehicles yeah but it's the worst estate planning vehicle that you couldn't even purchase\nYeah yeah so so it can be it can be a real challenge\nYou know so in essence I'm you know it's not that I you know I hate annuities everybody they're typically there there is something that if if I ever used one I might use an immediate annuity and I've used them in very very\nLimited limited cases and then it was only ... only annuities and never paid his commission just simply because I don't like the ... conflict of interest\nBut you know there are situations where somebody was just there were just like destitute they had no money and they just wanted to live life out with dignity and they didn't care whether anybody got anything\nAnd and needed their kids either you know in situations like this and and they just wanted to make sure that they that they had enough money to live off of and what you're doing is you're taking the asset value and you're spreading it across life expectancy if you live longer than life expectancy you win if you live shorter lives in that particular case\nAnd I wonder how many people actually have asked their broker\nHow much commission to make on this because I Know like when ... when clients will be with us in class I mean it was me I mean I shut down and show them exactly what our fees are and how much I'm going to make each year yeah um but with the ... you know they get paid well or to sell those things\nWell yeah and you know that's that's just it and and typically you know what happens is that most people don't even think that that thing you know it was a Jonathan runs a gallon often seen are having conversations this morning and he had he was talking about\nI had a client actually had an annuity product and said we went to the went to the if I said here I'm going to give you these questions to ask the adviser\nAnd the ... on how to do that and then he goes no he says hey look I just it's your money\nIt's worth it to you to you to do this and you know you can take the the questions right here and put them on your own pay for it they're probably going to know yes that the questions income from you 'cause you probably wouldn't know to ask these questions but just for your own sake go and ask these questions and they said it was funny 'cause that declined came back\nAnd he said get rid of this this has gone I'm not doing this and I would love to know I told you out of the you got to come on the show and I said I Would love to know what your questions were\nAt a ... because it was funny 'cause the client just ask the questions but most people don't know what the right questions are to ask you know you when you talk about how these things are put together and and um and the contract provisions they don't they just don't know what they are so\nNow I Wonder what actually upset the advisor more the other advice from or was it that he doesn't know the answers to the questions or that the guy was asking the question\n[laughter] good question I don't know so uh I'll tell you show where am I talking a little bit about um oh let's see what I Want to get into Wall

yeah yeah let me think about that a little bit and then I thought\nI did I had an interesting conversation with a guy this weekend and he was telling me he was buying individual stocks\nAnd technically we could say he was managing his own portfolio his own portfolio so we could say that he was and I said what company by it and then he tells me the company's fine and I said really are

company\nHas great prospects in the end the conversation was regarding technology it was technology related company\nAnd you know what it was really funny because this guy's sharp sharp guy you know it was really funny about it is he was talking about technology and he says you know it's technology technology where the future I said I heard the same thing late nineties when tech stocks were knocked it out because he had in ... but they're they're really some really cool things with an artificial intelligence\nBlah blah blah and this is much more more pervasive than the companies and late nineties and it just remind me of year well no it's different this time you know is often what you hear\nWhat he he made a comment I says hey look I says you know ... yeah bankrupt right but there are the inventor of the of the digital you know the ... the digital camera right\nAnd bankrupt and then I said you know Motorola inventor of the cell phone you know didn't do so well nobody has the Motorola digital or you know a different phone cell phone number to use it said a Motorola cell phone right\nAnd I said it is the users of the technology that benefit more than the and technology right\nAnd he goes he goes yeah you know you think about it if you own that stock in that company make some technology you bought the technology once and that's when they benefit but the end user of the technology is using it over and over and over again I said you just gave me the absolute best explanation for why you don't do what you did\nThat was beautiful that was brilliant yes when I owned a company making the technology I buy the technology from them once they benefit once\nOwn their stock they benefited once but if I buy the company using whatever this company developed I benefit over and over and over again\nI mean I just thought that was brilliant so back to Iraq you had this thing so you're talking to somebody was was um\nYou actually handle their their four one K. yeah Heather four one K. and they go are really upset because I'm so for a year to date and in September [noise] they were not doing as well as their portfolio with their other broker\nSo they had a second portfolio so they had their private stuff but they're they're they're I I Am following Jay okay and they decided to just keep their other assets with your other advisor okay alright got it so I sent them a message was they talked to me there's you know the partners of\nUh been looking at returns and we're not really happy or the other portfolios do much better and we are not picking on anybody but this is really educational what you're about to say that this is really good stuff so I pulled off to returns and I said okay what I Need you to do is I Need you to hold your reports that you're looking at so when I Do come down\nWe can compare what you're looking at that you have is your other advisor and what you have with us right now we're managing the money so it was as I kind of expected he had a lot of funds are all large ...\nOld very large ... stock the well known to us and a lot of people are in the perception that safer right and I basically said so much as you know what you would have been better off instead of having your six funds if you just went the vanguard of what the us and the five hundred\nAnd actually be more diversified and you'll be totally good\nNumber ... ... but then I showed him and he wouldn't be better off with them on our video coming out on that and it's way too late to you wait till you see how on diversified ...\nBut ... so I showed him than what we had yeah you know as far\nAs the investments and they're Nineteen different funds and their portfolio covering their Nike I'm Sorry to earn it\nNineteen different asset classes and the portfolio so I said to him you know in that area of the market we have that large ... is that as a ... area yeah we actually be shipped by a little bit yeah have you got from ...\nActually did better in that area of the market\nRight however right if you're a visor really knew what was he would have done in the beginning of this year is put you in micro kept stocks right\nBecause you're the date again in September the large cap area of the market was up ten and a half percent uh-huh where the micro cap was up all of them point three right you had better return sure we're not even better returns yeah\nBut then I showed him because what I tend to repeat what they had to write right but then when I Do is I showed them uh-huh you know yes\nThis year you might be happier or a year to date you might be happy with\nThe reason this is so important is because if you look at target date mutual funds you know if you look at portfolios put together by me the big mutual fund companies and we have reviewed thousands of portfolios over the years [noise]\nBar none I I almost never see anything other than this that large us growth companies dominate those mixes you know for the target date funds we just did a video on the website you know go to Paul Winkler dot com and watch this video and it is about\nI forgot the title of the video just ... it's like the myth of invest al ... when I come back I'll I'll tell you what the title is but basically what I did is I went through target date funds of some of the biggest fund companies out there\nAnd it was something like Ninety ... Ninety five percent of the money was in large and medium sized companies the vast majority of the money was in large companies\nAnd we're going to be coming out with a video\nAnd um\nYeah check this and when I when I Do this one video I'm going to be taking some of these like the U.S will be five hundred to ... versus the SP five hundred versus total market versus what a real diversified portfolio should hold and it is mind boggling we've already done already done the charts wait till you see it\nIt is it\nDominates people's investment portfolio so this is really important to get your mind wrapped around because you could be taking a whole lot more risk\nAnd really hurting yourself the long run as an investor not paying attention to this type of stuff you really really got to make sure that you understand these concepts listening investor coaching show Paul Winkler along with our work will be back right after the sense of dark night\nI'm waiting for humans [noise]\nFedEx delivery passion what we let her by delivering\nAccurate mortgage good wants to know that being frightened of goblins or goals makes a lot more sense than being scared of the home loan process no matter if you're a first\nTime homebuyer or wondering if that cash out revise right for you when we say we'll walk you through the loan process from start to close that includes being available to you on a nice weekend and spooky holidays too so why wait apply today at accurate MPG dot com accurate mortgage group\nAnd division of a ...

is\nYou know we were first\nBook earlier right right okay so let's let me kind of um throw sign out there to kind of maybe clarify for our listeners or what that is\nWas you know you're buying your pain what you're paying for the ashes of the company right so forward as an example is trading at nine dollars a year roughly ... and the price to book ratios one\nWriter you basically buying the company at the value of the underlying\nShow up today and you go why well ... there's not that it's under priced it deserves to be selling for that because of just struggle\nNow Tesla on the other hand stock is training at about two hundred and sixty two dollars richer ... the price to book ratios a Levin point for his age so basically you're paying two hundred and sixty two dollars for twenty three dollars worth of assets\nYeah yeah and you know why why would a company sell for a greater numbers than that it's just simply because you know people looking at going well there's there's potential there may maybe there's there's some growth potential there and you know ... and ... if you look at a company selling for multiple high multiple\nIt is typically because of the fact that other investors see that potential as well and and what they're doing is they're saying well we're willing to pay a lot more for this particular company because of the growth and that's that's what's so challenging back because she is what people do as investors\nYou know they're they're told to look at the price to earnings ratio for example and there's a lot of\nYou'll hear people talk about you know to look at the ... the ratio we know what's going on the ratio but it is a static number is the problem in other words when I'm looking at PET now I may be looking even worse at you know price of the stock divided by the ... over the past year which is really irrelevant\nI if I Would be an improvement to look at the price the stock compared to forward earnings which is what I think the earnings are going to be over the next year but we're still only dealing with one year's worth of earnings\nAnd the problem is is that it excludes the growth in the earnings 'cause you could have a company\nThat has little or no earnings whatsoever and they'd be be selling for a hundred times earnings and the reason they're selling for a hundred times earnings because they have a lot of expenses right now that may go away which will cut their costs their earnings to go up or maybe they don't have any sales\nBut their sales are likely to go up with time simply just because of the fact that

the Senate has voted fifty to forty eight to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh with demonstrators in the gallery\nThe confirmation process was characterized by controversy and protest from start to finish circles who spent [noise]\nBut there is talk out there that and it blew my mind I was I was actually going looking at the data on on where money is flowing right now\nMoney is flowing out of us stocks right now [noise] and flowing more heavily into international stocks\nWhich is mind boggling 'cause most people like to buy us stocks because they've done well and what this commentator on this was saying was that\nThis is smart this is really smart they're buying more international sucked I'm no no it's not\nYou're changing your mix basin are predicting the future why are you pulling money out of us stocks and putting more money and international stocks you're predicting that that is going to do better now it is just as irrational to predicted international it's going to do better as it is to predict the U.S is going to do better\nBut that's what investors do is they they love to just ... it's just it's literally gambling and they don't look at it is that\nOnly time I could see if they're pulling money out of us stocks and putting into international markets as if they're just ... no no this is not what they were doing well\nYeah you're right they're gambling and speculation ... and ... what do you think about that for a second though it's probably the bigger institutions that are doing that true because that's why you're seeing while you're seeing the money flows because of the stuff that we follow\nAs opposed to the individual investor who is chasing the market yeah\nYou know the institutional investors are going to where it's slow so they're selling what you've already seen appreciation the gamblers that they think is unique and\nYou know it's not going to continue to let's go and reposition money right and that's what it is to reposition out and theoretically what they're doing is correct you're selling Hi I'm fine low income but if they're changing how much they have been to grow in ... in us how much they have on a percentage basis\nThen it's market timing gambling and she actually and that's\nExactly what it is and what was happening it's so interesting is the the writers of the financial writer with logging it as smart as a smart move I'm In the little it literally the title of the article was the dumb money is bailing on us stocks that smart\nThat was that was the title of the article in the wall Street Journal the dumb money is bailing\nOn the u._s. stock market and and that's that's smart and you know in reality what ... what he was doing is literally just saying hey this is great your market I mean this is really really good there's only one problem studies a pension plan some of the best that you and the market timing worked if you could do this\nWe will see\nWe would see more than four percent of small cat managers beating the benchmark reading what the market does well we would see more than eight percent of large cat managers doing better if they could do it they would be beating what the market does on their own with their skill but if it's not happening\nWell you do now I'm working on new out of a rhythm right what I'm working on your algorithm no yeah there's new algorithm

will be able to start moving money around\nI have a point on this I have a point to make on marijuana stocks and Josh this is actually an intelligent point so lifted not man ready\nI got to think of but there was an article in ah where did I see this this article was about health care socks let me see if I can find this thing was about health care stocks and the amount of money that companies are paying for health care right now this really shocked me\nWall Street journal yes it was Wall Street journal you know what the average employer provided health insurance cost is for a family right now\nJust take a stab what do you think fourteen thousand dollars not bad fourteen thousand dollars cannot get twenty thousand dollars\nA day before it can twenty right [laughter] I Know my ... twenty thousand dollars yeah twenty thousand\nDollars this blew my mind you know back in Nineteen Ninety I think it was in Nineteen Ninety that maybe you know nine nine Ninety Nineteen Ninety\nWhat was it was a year two thousand that number was like five thousand dollars so we're literally looking at a massive increase\nAnd workers are paying fifty five hundred dollars on average for their premiums for for their own premiums and the employers ... playing I'm playing the rest right so if we look back in time we see that this amount of increase is is pretty amazing\nIt's a pretty amazing amount of increase in the cost of insurance overtime and what companies are actually absorbing now why is this important\nWell if people are paying this amount of money in insurance costs and companies are paying this amount of money in insurance costs that means that that money is not going to something else that might be more beneficial to the economy or to him humanity\n'cause we're just talking about keeping people healthy in America right we're not talking about adding value in any appreciable way as far as adding productivity or adding quality of life\nBecause we were getting health care and we're not getting any more health care the article said is if we're not utilized to get an any greater level utilization is the same\nSo we're not seeing an increase in your vision that's why the costs are higher we're seeing the same exact amount and get ...\nNow what does that has to do as marijuana [laughter] okay so you know there is a lot of debate that medical use of marijuana could actually help out in dealing with some conditions and you know you\nHear people say that maybe some of the ... and pharmaceutical companies are not necessarily as much in favor of medical use of marijuana because maybe they won't need people need to use the the pharmaceuticals as much\nIf they're using this to alleviate some of the symptoms and some of the issues that they're dealing with and it may be more effective views and the fact is that you know if you look at marijuana and say well it's a fairly cheap\nSubstance to grow I ... and you know you\nMay have and I'm just curious I don't know the answer to this but the the curiosity is that you have this one article and investment news says that they're forty seven states that is\nNow legal to use it as having having medicinal use of marijuana\nNow I've seen varying numbers on that I looked on the Internet to check that number from investment news because other numbers out there where the twenty five states it was yeah if you do a search irate you're going to find in Google you'll find twenty five in one article you'll find thirty one in another article\nBut here here's the thing if you think about investors that want to invest in marijuana stocks\n[noise] what did they basically say they're saying that these companies that produce this and produce it for medicinal purposes are going to benefit\nWhen I Would submit that it is possible that the end users the American public is this the turns out to be something that is really great for medicinal purposes\nThat's the end public will benefit in that they will have lower medical costs and corporations will have lower medical costs so it is not the company that produced a product that\nBenefited more you're following my line of reasoning here it's not the company that produces the product that benefit more but society\nApril\nIt's just like I always say it was it the developer of the cell phone that Motorola that benefited the most from the development of the product\nWas us the end users who are now using it to increase our productivity\nIt only gets higher for the people\nQuit it I thought I drove from butter yes quit just stop many people are just

good\nJust sometimes it gets just really really weird but they do still have some good so there's a lot of really interesting things going on in the world of economics right now\nAnd\nYou know if there aren't easy solutions to lot of the economic problems going on around the world you know if you look at international stocks and you say well you know international stocks are selling for in many cases one third\nOf the price of what a lot of us counterparts are selling for one third\nYou know it just when it when you look at it just apples to apples price compared to the book values of

and there\nAre slow economy a tax you know issues there was a really good article about taxes in the economist and saying we've got to bring him up to you know really got to bring them up to a modern

not in the economist found us where they did they use the carbon filament ... tungsten\nAnd it is it's it's not the brightest one night light you know so it there are some issues is on the brightness

you find the ... the best mutual funds to recommend to clients uh-huh and I thought it was funny that it was an advisor asking other advisors this question does pretty scared and you kinda wonder what kind of training I got it for ... uh [laughter] I Do the best the most\nTraining I I was recruited by one of the big firms they tried to recruit me and the guy was telling me about the training and it was literally all how to get new clients by going door to door and knocking on the door and what you would do is you walk up to the door you knock on the door and he says you'd heavier card\nAnd he says and what you do is you back away from the door when you knock on the door you're backing the way you're handing the person you're card as you're backing away and the reason is because you feel

out there that big because of the way they solicit business and and the advisors are trained to sell not necessarily know a whole lot about investing but what it was something about that what was the ...\nThe funny thing was the client you know the a couple of other tree or other advisors their answer was oh past performance yeah I didn't want to go with our cats you idiot and you know as far as you look a track record you know [laughter] and I just had to laugh I mean I don't post on any of this unless you get the humor of it well it's a terrible\nI mean some of you may be sitting there going well what else would you look at why wouldn't you look at past performance whole because past performance is how mutual fund companies get to get you to buy their stuff but markets do what they run in cycles they go off and they go down and you can't predict the cycles\nBut if you're buying based on past performance you may have something in investment that's just in a ten year up cycle and at the top of the cycle right and you're looking at going this gotta take great tenure track record and you just bought something it's a top of its cycle\nI was just absolutely not so you've got to go dig deeper than that\nWell on that was one of the ways that we were actually taught to sell funds because you know you're still a fund the four or five star fun\nYeah you know four or five years later it's not a four or five ... or ... or to start fund and then when you know like playing ... junior during the review and they're not happy with their performance sushi yeah the managers just didn't do as well as we thought he would know this is the fund manager that we're recommending well yeah we had a much better job of what's actually happening\nThe advisory was forcing this lines to sell low and by\nRight right and you literally the wall Street Journal had an article about that ... they called the five star fun curse right if this is a great way of buying mutual funds than they probably wouldn't refer [laughter] I'm just to say [laughter]\nWhat was that other one you said there were ... or look at it I thought it was kind of funny it was something you were just looking at an advisor question it was something about trying to get a raise a certain amount of money by the end of\nNo yeah that one near um that's funny is a new advisor and he has to new advisors to the question was

but I think it was CBS News when they were doing the the trades the computerized traits\n... high frequency yeah high frequency trading and they were talking about and they were interviewing some guys that were actually market makers they wanted to be market makers I wanted to have a separate exchange for trading things\nAnd they weren't going to allow high frequency traders ... and the point that I made when I was teaching on it as the high frequency that those high frequency trades\nHave actually driven down the trading costs and you know for the last Fifteen you look at Fifteen Years worth of data and actually the training costs have come down since uh since these guys have been out there doing this\nWell what what happened is that these people were trying to have this whole trading platform where there were not allow anybody else\nAny computerized trades on their platform and what they were trying to do is monopolize it and get people to buy and sell on their platform instead of the other platforms because that's how they were going to make money and I thought that's it\nGenius and they had a major media from doing all their marketing\nI was like oh my goodness so anyway back to this so you got this\nI'm eighty today man just just plan on it it's happening this suddenly going to be all that way\nSo dark pool investing so you have this commercials that I've learned the dark pools what are they\nWell there you know they're they're basically as they say in this article not the most transparent things on Wall street and you know you might want to know what they are they're private clubs where investors can go to X execute trades without the public finding out\nInitially geared to big institutions the one to execute a large sale and a dark place now they're used by investors of many different types which basically tells you if a lot of other investors are now using them\nThe cat's out of the bag and it's not that big of a deal anymore oh don't they called themselves the stock whisper just stuck with [laughter]\nKnow horse was for no no stop spur so stock whisper I like that now I'm ... it's so so you have these these trade now there are some of these traits ... still do exist for a valid reasons\n'cause we use fund companies that do use the shit I ... and I'll talk about how they're used in a good valid way but it's one of these one of these things that you know you can get people really\n... up in arms over conspiracy theories like they're being taken advantage of somehow by ... by using ultra fast telecom links microwave towers especial access through exchanges a flash boys they're able to gain an edge over other traders [noise]\nOkay so it had it has to be the same news outlet has to be because this is what they said in their news program let me explain this okay so we've got a stock you have market makers\nJust like Walgreens Wal Mart eyes Kroger whoever make a market for\nToothpaste\nThey buy toothpaste they mark it up and they sell it to the next person right okay now here's the deal so\nKroger has so many tubes of toothpaste and then Walmart has so many ... let's say that they've got tend to observe toothpaste at kroger's intend at Walmart and ... and let's say that some person runs in\nTwo Kroger let's say and buys all tend to observe toothpaste well somebody might surmise that oh this person there is a big demand for toothpaste today\nWe're heading over to Walmart you know to to buy up their stuff before somebody else does now we're going to mark it up and sell it\nHalloween is coming up to Oh yes right that right they do they're going to need to face because we're talking cavities here now [laughter] very good excellent job she [laughter] your money [laughter] so so that's exactly what's going on you'll have somebody that has\nXYZ stock and somebody buys up the entire inventory of one company of one ... of one market maker and what they do is they were buying these computers were buying it from the other market makers but here's the problem\nThey were taking a huge risk because if the demand was only for let's say eleven shares or living to the toothpaste and my example\nThen what would happen is if they bought the other ten to ... from the neck supplier or you know let's say they bought all twenty from both suppliers then they mark it up and how many too so they get to sell for the markup one too\nSo it doesn't help them in the least\nAnd what happens there say oh they're taking advantage in the mutual fund company has gone they're taking advantage of us blah blah blah I'm sitting there going well you know why are you guys actively managing portfolios and stock market timing anyway I mean you know number one that's that's not a good idea number two\nIt was just a lack of understanding on how this works and as I said over\nTime the cost of trading of actually come down with all of this hyper trading because these dark fool things now if you look out their further and you do some research on it a Britain's financial conduct authority you know they're they're watchdogs actually did a study on black\nOr or or dark pools and they actually found that they had a lot of benefits and lo and behold behold lo or one of the benefits exactly what I just said they provide a market\nThey were they provide a bigger market and they provide more liquidity in exchanges because the more trading you see back in Seventeen hundreds Adam Smith wrote a book called the wealth of nations\nAnd he talked about market efficiency as as we are going to have more efficient markets do the ease of trades and ease of access to information and that's all they're doing is providing so we get in get ourselves all excited and worried about are we being taken advantage of\nAnd you can get a you know lead in on somebody else can I beat him out with all this stuff\nAnd you know in reality they actually provide benefits to the marketplace now how do traders used them legitimately infants now we use funds in in our practice we look for funds to do some of these trades off the market\nAnd the reason is is is when a mutual fund company becomes large\nYou end up with them holding a lot of stock\nWhen they hold a lot of stock let's say that they need to move out of a position you know because the company is no longer a small kept company has a medium sized company or it's no longer value it becomes a growth company so needs to be moved out\nA big mutual fund company does not want to dump a whole bunch of stock at the same point in time\nYou know ... and conversely when they buy stock for the portfolio they don't want to come in and buy a bunch of it all at one point in time because they drive the price of stock they're buying they drive down the price of the stock that they're selling so little do is off the market block traits\nAnd fun company ... actually take advantage of other fund companies buying whole fund companies for example ones that don't engage in stock market timing like what I prefer will take advantage of other people that want to get rid of big blocks of stock\nSo listen you've got ABC fun company that's gone man\nYou know this stock is going to go down it's going to go down on my goodness we we got to get rid of it\nNow do they really know if it's going to go down no they're guessing it's going to go down how do we know that they don't know what's going to go down because of the fact that Ninety four percent of large cat managers failed to match market returns the past Fifteen Years Ninety six percent of small cat managers failed match market returned so they don't really know what they think they know\nSo what they do is they want to get rid of a whole bunch of it and then you'll have a fun company like you know what I Would use and and what a from like ours would use and we would go here's a guy trying to guess where the market's going to go oh you're trying to get rid of five hundred thousand shares of ABC stock I tell you what\nIf you go out there and try to get rid of five hundred thousand shares at once you're going to get killed\nBy word nice guys well by all five hundred thousand shares off of you but we won't pay the ask price\nWill pay a little bit less than the ... price which is you got two different price and I will explain all that mess it doesn't really matter\nBut what happens we'll do that and then we'll take the whole block now why would they take that deal because they think it's going to go down into the into the seller they'll take that deal and so you'll have fun companies that will engage in that type of activity in it and it makes perfect sense\nSo you know that's um when you see these commercials you see in general when you see books about you know how we're gonna we're gonna teach you how to be the most awesome ... investor ever because we've got these great secrets and we're going to share them with you if you buy our especially when they give you

the investor coaching show your back right after this super talking on\nThe west who'd one podcast network ... and ...\nI pay it out and David ... the uncle\nBecause it gets taxed right away right\nSo why not go back in buyback share prices because what will happen is it increases the share price writing because I'm divided up high in a fewer pieces and I've got an increasing the share price and I don't pay taxes till I sell it\nOkay so why don't invest in a bunch of unneeded new infrastructure or things that may be losers down the road\nThere what companies are doing is completely rational\nAnd and I don't want you know it makes me kind of shake my head when you see you know commentators they should know better and and people you know politicians and so on so forth coming out and saying this is terrible this is awful and I don't have they ever run a company\nDo they not understand that this is just absolutely rational activity on the part of corporate leaders whose job is to do the best thing for their shareholders\nTheir job is not to go and create a bunch of jobs for people it's not to make politicians look good\nIf not for their their whole job is to\nMe actually

I'm All right so\nLet's see what a what a talk about annuities what are you [laughter]\nLet's just do little Jane I'm I I haven't seen that the article in to join a science have journalists and say that there's no limit the human human lifespan why\nYes and then of course there's this new say at rather MIT has issued a news the big news that they have already reverse uh ... this study reversing\nThe aid of a mice or that you know like oh my goodness that was like thinking\nThey reverse the age of mice uh-huh so I'm going to have it as you just about anything that that mouse is going to die [laughter]\nSo what's going to do with our lifestyle in happens when somebody steps on the mouse it's over ... from what what no go sorry go ahead uh-huh so if there is no limit to life span yeah uh-huh and\nI'm not I'm not buying the premise though but if I go ahead\nAnd we reverse thing and there's already studies or medicine that is trying to reverse the age of ...\nOh I think I think where you're going to sort of interesting and some you know and thinking oh my goodness and then you hear that\nMost annuity ... some new way to stop and he's making their price boy yeah boy I tend to ... they have sold there they are getting out the annuity business just like some of the long term care are they really yes uh-huh\nNo I Know that the German insurers were absolutely\nFit to be tied and scared to death about the annuity business because of the fact\nThat they had the negative interest rates and then they were wondering if they're reading to let them\nBehind it yes they're ... I think that that it's really about the jeopardy\nYou know he says so you think do you think that's going on with some of\nThe the fixed indexed annuity ... the fourth issue or a fixed indexed annuity just sold four billion dollars worth of\nA new to this is really uh-huh yes so think about what's gonna do okay now how is it the\nOnly and this this is my ... I had not seen is so so so in essence what you're saying the reason they're getting out of because well longevity is increasing there is no more Shia around about it you know there there are actually\nFinding ways to keep people alive a whole lot longer and the will to live in a lot of people say well you know and if I can hear my father used to say if I ever get that bad you know just shoot\nMe you know his own people don't die anymore they just get older what they do die\nCome [laughter] good night [laughter] but but you but\nThey do have a will to continue on even though their health is as bad as if they\nBut they would still be pay\nJurors her yeah they still be they had on the rise and if a commission rice is running so they so in essence what Arlene thing as let's say that you give an insurance company a hundred thousand dollars and at the time that they issue a product you have a ten year life expectancy\nAnd they give you a hundred thousand you give them a hundred thousand dollars they're going to pay you ten thousand dollars a year for ten years that's what they're figuring out now they figure a couple of\nPeople only live for two years and they pay twenty grand out and it's over they figure that a few people are going to live Eighteen years and\nTrain\nHere\nI don't bring the game on the show with [noise]\nOr in the ferment all [noise] [laughter]\nCorporate we've got the best okay so this article was infected visor in Arlene runs the mount Juliet and the ... offices for us\nWho uses annuity who doesn't research has found relatively high percentage of respondents disliked annuities and you know you find that people don't like them in general just because of the fact that it's it's a control thing a big part of it one might expect the risk at first they said well who doesn't like him\nYou'd expect the risk averse and those two expected to live longer to be avid devoted ... of a new division\nNow a lotta people will buy annuities and they all for the idea that there is a guaranteed rate of return they're going to get five six seven percent rate of return on their money and they don't realize that is not how it works that is just an illusion they actually call those phantom accounts are you\nTalking about the gang funny money at that and the funny money money\nMoney yeah the phantom accounts I remember one time there is a financial guy called my show years and years ago and he decided he was going to argue with me about this oh ... yeah it has like body look\nYou know China and and you know you've got these countries around the world in Japan lending money to the United states and at the time we were very very concerned\nAbout the buying of government bonds from foreign countries and how it might influence the U.S politics and so on so for\nMe to realize that you know if you look at the percentage of the U.S debt it's actually owned by foreign countries it's it's not that hot and most of our debts actually held by us yes that's a cycling yeah\nSo that's one of the things he was making a point about as like how these great rates of return I says you know why don't we called the Chinese government right now because they would love to buy your annuity from you if it's going to pay that high rate of return you know it's really\nIt's just a marketing gimmick is we're really what it gets down to it's a marketing gimmick the income riders\nIncrease at that level but the insurance companies ultimately in control of the income and they just you know they just bring the income that they'll pay out later on down to make up for it so it's it's really very\nVery much Lucian it's not a bit anyway says ah one might expect the risk averse or those who expect to live longer to be avid devoted ease of a new division that they were as Arlene federal area would be really bad for the insurance company but anyway\nWith the money in the hands of the insurance not available to the owner in case of emergency or they'd be quest at their death\nSo if you knew it ties you're having them head out over your life expectancy once you pass away with a straight life only annuity the money is gone\nAfter you pass away now you if you have a new it ties do this kind of like a pension plan when you have a company pension plan and you have a life\nLet's say some kind of a life issue that comes up a medical emergency or something like that you can't call your former employer and say hey can you guys increased my pension this month\nAnd it doesn't work that way your pension is what it is now with the\nNew uh the the same thing happened now there are writers that you can put on policies ride Arlene yeah to have some liquidity ... what does that cost\nMoney\nYou have to pay extra money in order to get those riders to have more liquidity which takes away from your return and takes away your income later\nOn so there's no such thing as a free lunch\nPrices the products can be a turnoff and the question of default risk on the part of the company isn't a may ... which is what they said here army it is in ... the the part of the company the default risk is into a major factor in people's decisions either it should be\nIt should be but remember it's the they are being sold so don't you that the advice or he's not going to send to wait that because it's not possible\nRight it's not going to love salt in the likelihood of a sale of our products yeah we're not going to talk about that that's exactly right\nNow I Would be really hard pressed with two new ties that would that would be a really difficult thing for me to do is just because I don't like giving up control to an insurance company that's making the investment decision\nEspecially seeing as it was a hot a really big insurance companies they were getting bailed out by the government do to bad investments decisions and Nate\nI'm just not really excited about giving up control in that particular manner\nI you know I don't like the idea of money's gone at death\nYou know I Would you know ... I could pay more I could pay more to have some money laughter by a writer to have access to some liquidity but that's just defeats the purpose in my mind so\nHence the uh the annuities aren't really popular with in fact it's like why is it less than five percent something like that Arlene that people that actually build a new a ... a a product and they they fight to said yeah it's it's not high\nIt's it's not high at all most people don't do that and it's it's very much is very similar when it comes to for example I you know like people are given the option of a new ... are taking a lumps on a on a pension\nYou know most people will take the lump sum I always tell people ask me first asked me first let me run the numbers to make sure you don't have something that looks like it's subsidized or anything like that yeah 'cause I I've had I've seen circumstances where the annuity payout\nHas been much higher than actual warily I Would expect\nIt doesn't happen often but I've seen it so you know I Would not make the decision to just do it without consulting somebody but you know the reality of it is\nThat you can end up with the situation ah you know where you're giving up something good if you go in a lump sum just take a lump sum distribution on a pension plan but\nYou know for the most part most for the vast majority of people they want a new uh ties they don't like that they liked to especially as people get older they don't think any way to given\nYou already have and and nobody would think you make it or not right yeah we call a Social Security there you go yeah why do you have why do you need another annuity\nIt's interesting you say that because you know in a lot of the the financial planning you know the classes that I've taken over the years they actually consider Social Security a fixed income element\nThat is a fixed income Illinois\nYeah it absolutely is so you know you can have that base right there and your reality when you wait longer just take your Social Security it's a pretty big fixed income piece you know and it and it adds a lot of stability to the forefront now we we were talking earlier about how the system has some financial strain\nBut the reality there is that there are a lot of possible\nVictims raising tax rates on Social Security I got and um\nYou know the possibility of re increasing the retirement age and it was such a thing but I think some kind of yeah funny you said that because now you know\nOne of the economy and uh [noise]\nWas one of them\nAs I say that\nSocial Security the easiest\nThing yeah not not a I'm a care not\nEither good good plot Social Security is a good good points on the act excellent way to end the hour so don't we don't want to scare anybody regarding Social Security there are so many ... such a cooking show falling star dot com is the website that you can check out for home video and audio and all that good stuff the investment projects [noise]\nThey said you need to make me applied individual results may vary the website for details\nI'm buying a huge flat screen TV so I can finally see it without my glasses why can't really\nThat's what I'm hearing my glasses and contact her pain I'd love to finally get rid of these but who can afford\nLasik you can\nBecause some basic mission is to do is offering dramatically low prices and an absolute free consultation Jeff taxed we're nine nine two three five zero three five zero lasik vision Institute has already perform over a million procedures they use the latest FDA approved lasik technology that helps the majority of\nPatients a cheap twenty twenty vision for a fraction of what others charge\nLet her vision better value the ...

years before the event\nEver occurred that's right well thanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hard scams now most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans\nTell a doctor when an artery has already become narrowed by plaque well that's the problem\nThey say now that they can figure this out even before develops they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries\nInflamed and what's going to be going on five years down the line that you should\nStart preventive measures right now to avoid the platform for me so you can start singing are you ready don't go bake\nIn my heart [laughter] okay [noise]\nI actually thought that was funny [noise]\nAll right this next story is not for the kids so if you have kids that are listening to the came commando show time for them to cover their ears or you want to mute the television if you're watching the game commando show there mute the radio if they're in the room as long as they're clear we're good to go or at your ready\nGood there's a dark side of the technology that a lot of folks are brushing off it's the use of robots for use in\nHow do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a pole dance and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is legal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with a company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a loved ... brought the one issue soon so that people would be able to use its human like dolls\nA kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie Westworld K Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors ... location then they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits\nSo Houston's city council actually updated a local audience to specifically banned individuals from having sex with a device that resembles\nA human being [noise] okay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the came commandos show a we have come up with the perfect name for that how about\nA Sears and Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck yes okay [noise] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise\nAn average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies since the year two thousand eleven drought and falls are the biggest killers\nThe studies show that men and count for seven of the ... fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all sell the death so here's what's going on legislation politicians\nAre getting together and coming up with no selfie zones so it's right okay you're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building a U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nA a tie woman was hit and killed by a train this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the real tracks\nBritish woman Luis she's thirty seven and her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach walls so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we may see\nThat's it but if you think about it on a positive way at least they had a recent had shot for the funeral mhm\nAnd finally be careful what you search for online we were talking about this
