[noise]\nSeveral your mission hurricane damage Mike moss CNN is reporting Saudi Arabia is ready to admit the death of Washington Post journalist ... she was the result of interrogation that gun out of hand\nThan most intended to lead was abduction from turkey tourist wanted our what David is outside the sound of yeah but see it is tumbled where the killings occurred\nScenes according to these two sources that it was an interrogation gone wrong or perhaps they were intending to try to pay can smuggle him out of the country\nEarlier today President Trump said it was possible ... murder was a result of roe killers the president and first lady of toward the Florida communities hardest hit by hurricane Michael diseases\nAh the Democrat was up nine points\nThen there was a poll Mason Dixon on the twenty seventh and ... just he's just a point\nNo I haven't seen anything in the October and this is post Kavanaugh will this affect the ... the governor's race this is Rhonda Sanders of course congressman who's running for governor of Florida will this have any bearing on that what it looks to me like it looks to me like the Democratic losing ground now I haven't seen to Santa\nSo in your head it's probably too close to call this point but that's another one they told me to look at it I'm looking at it\nAnd what I see is it appears to be a trained if it appears\nTo be that the Democrats are trending down and the Republicans are trending up am I going to make a prediction for November six oh no\nNo no no no because I learned my lesson they because then you you said well I I say on the best information possible not telling us that's going to happen and then people getting you know they blame me when somebody doesn't win like it's my fault no I'm just telling on the best information that we have\nBut right now it looks like it's trending toward the uh the Republicans I'm trying to talk to you and grab another this when vox nine out enough votes as far left so we'll see what the the Thirteen most important governor elections in twenty eight thing\nAnd Florida happens to be one of them and seeing the main\nHeld on to the New Jersey where they got ... latest maybe they got something in the October I Can't imagine there aren't pulled this in real clear politics doesn't have anything after September twenty seventh I Can't imagine that there's not something after that well let's see what Scott Walker\nComing ... ... ... can who's to them and we don't care\nUh Ohio I don't think we got any polling data they're just giving a rundown of who's who so if we can get the latest from the polling data how red and green so I Know yeah\nHe's something that may help the Republicans and certainly a Rick Scott is how they handle this thing with with the hurricane you know that's always that's always a big deal I mean people go OK if you're going to be one of my elected officials had did you do you know how'd you do handling this\nAnd say okay\nHere's into this from Seattle seem to think this is amazing now you folks in Florida may have seen something but I'm looking at the latest polling I don't see anything in October this is a huge deal it's a big deal\nAnd there's not any polling data for October for crying out loud we're in the middle of October this is a oh come on there's bound to be but\nWhat I'm telling you the latest I saw is that it looked like it was trending down for the Democrats will see how it turns out of course if the Republicans lose that it's not the end of the world although I think any time a Democrat takes over state it's not good for the state I can tell you that but it depends on what he's working with as far as the legislature and all the rest of it\nBut what I'm telling you is when they tell me to look at race in Minnesota and I do\nAnd the race in Minnesota tells me that the Republican has made a sixteen point turnaround when the last month I'm not saying that this is the only race to look at what I'm what I'm what I'm Wondering is is is the proverbial canary in the\nCoal mine but nobody now is paying attention to because it's going so strong for the Republicans and this is just one poll but it's a New York times\nAnd that's the only polling operation I can see this polling in that district I'm sure they got some internal polls with the campaign themselves but um you know as far as that's concerned\nAnyway now on to the other stuff the sixty minutes interview and Elizabeth Warren says she actually has some Indian blood\nHow much do this I'll give you this first when the Boston Globe was going to be slanted and her direction\nSenator Elizabeth Warren released a DNA test that provide strong evidence she had a Native American and her family tree dating back six to ten generations an unprecedented move by one of the top possible contenders for the twenty twenty Democrat nomination for president\nWarren who's planes to Native American blood have been marked by President Trump than other Republicans provided the test results to the global on Sunday\nAnd an effort to diffuse questions about our ancestry that it persisted for years she planted elaborate rollout today she probably already has\nA aimed for widespread attention the analysis of warns DNA was done by Carlos Bustamante at Stanford University professor an expert in the field who won the twenty ten MacArthur Fellowship also noticed a genius grant\nFor his work on tracking population migration via DNA Analysis he concluded that the vast majority of warrants ancestry is European but he added that quote the results strongly support the existence oven on ad mixed Native American ancestor\nPick out the Warren's pure and Native American ancestor appears in her family tree and the range of six to ten generations ago that timing fits Warren's family lore passed down during her Oklahoma upbringing\nThat are great great great grandmother overseeing Sara Smith was at least partially Native American\nSmith was born in late Seventeen hundred she denied his flight in historical documents there was a time Indians face discrimination and Smith would have strong incentives to call herself white as possible\nSo if OC Smith Sara Smith and now she's next thing she goes to say ... little green apples both uh that'll be safe\n[laughter]\nIf she were fully Native American or Indian that would make Warren one thirty second negative but of course she's not she just had a piece so what they're saying is she's between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American\nSo I had somebody out there who sent me this let me see if we can grab this where the yeah says ah you should know this\nThe Cherokees in North Carolina require one sixteenth six point two

I'm finding out folks and I told you this long with Kanye and the black community too when when you start hearing this uh I'm not crazy about Trump but and I think you're hearing that with a lot of folks out there they're going you know\nAll right let's just let the guy go I told you this the other day I'm Talking to somebody I always tell the vast staff here I was talking to somebody who was not a they hadn't been Trump and they become a Trump fan but they were not a Trump fan the main reason they weren't a Trump fan\nIs because of that Access Hollywood tape and so we're sitting there talking about it and I don't even know\nThat he realized this but as he's telling me about the whole thing and he's getting really\nGinned up and excited about everything\nHe's using some very colorful language now what if I took of a a secret tape and I don't go I never do that but what if I were secretly taping our conversation\nAnd just happened to send it to his boss or send it to his board of directors or whatever and say listen to this languages guy was using\nThem as soon as any wrong with I mean this is the way a lot of guys talk and some ladies to when I'm On the ladies but some women to\nYou in private and it was the same\nThing I'm I'm sitting here thinking do you hear yourself because you're using this kind of and that wasn't\nYou know like grab 'em in the whatever\nBut Trump was saying that not ever thinking that anybody else was listening other than Billy Bush and never dreaming that was going to be made public have you ever said something in private that you would cringe if somebody outside the conversation with the other person you're talking about ever heard it well that's the whole point\nAnd this guy is now a convert the Trump\nIt was ironic that that kind of language was what was upsetting to and I remember the time I go I was shocked\nBut then when you stop and think okay Phil if you're ever said well I've never seen anything quite like that but there's no telling what Johnny being I say\nI Know Johnny just to cringe themselves well Johnny B and I say privately that if it got on the air well we would go oh sorry [laughter] but that was meant for the ... year\nWell that's the whole thing\nBetween the Access Hollywood tape which I think was probably the low point of Trump's whole campaign and political career well I don't know Stormy Daniels\nYou know comes it's a tough one although the story that he keeps denying that but I mean this is something that we heard right that we could put our hands well a bad choice of words um that we could it was something tangible that we could listen to and make a judgment call alone\nAnd I think when we do that we go oh ... well at the end of the day that could be anybody couldn't it I'm not saying that it's a ... it's like the Shiite whole comment about the countries I don't know where they said that or not\nBut people like um oh what's his face the our former and see Michael Steele the ... it was it might yeah Michael Steele\nAll upset about that that he would refer to some of these poor nations a Shiite holes well that's what they are now you don't say that out in public but he didn't if in fact he did say this\nThis was to a choice few people sitting around in a meeting about what to do about poverty in some of these places and sending money and throwing good money after bad and the rest of it\nSo he's just he's just telling it like it is and most of us would agree then as you look back on these nations that he was talking about\nWell he was talking about some of the nation's in any actually means all of them that he mentioned we're in the top twenty of Shiite holes from from the list of Shiite holes with the UN they don't call it that is the poorest nations on earth and they are dumps\nAnd and Donald Trump was talking about that they are safer Michael Steele to get upset about some private conversation but I think all of this\nIs blown is blowing

someone without Louis today or dot com\nHenderson bail Nashville\nStudio where dogs I mean I [noise]\nThey want me to talk about tax cuts the economy now trades or for the rest of it and I'm going to tell them what I'm going to tell you and that is when you lower taxes you're going to stimulate the economy it's happened every time it's been tried and it works every time and every time the liberals are trying to tell you this is going to be horrible\nBecause you're just given a tax cut to the rich\nAnd I'm going to really so we have this story today ladies and gentlemen let me start off with the headline top three percent of us taxpayers pay the majority of income taxes in twenty sixteen this is from Bloomberg\nYeah this is not some right wing bill top three percent of us taxpayers pay the majority bin ... more than half let's just stop\nYou don't even have to go we will go further but we don't have to go for the man\nFor you to tell me that the rich are paying their fair share and the top three percent are paying the majority of the income tax tell me how that's not them being there more than their fair share well this is what the liberals do but this dog ain't hunting anymore\nBecause people are looking at this going this is tired old rhetoric from the Democrats we know better\nWe know better than when we got the tax cuts yeah the corporation got cuts but they also created jobs they gave bonuses they gave raises all of this came up so the Democrats are still trying to tell you this is kind of me don't look at it don't look at it on a no no this is just a big move your imagination\nYou only look at that because this is horrible take our word for it it's really horrible I Know it feels good\nBut it's like a drug they've got you drug go with the other GOP that's a GOP drug they've got you it's really horrible and it's not it's absolutely fabulous\nLet's go through some of the numbers here\nIndividual income taxes\nOr the federal government's single biggest revenue source in fiscal year twenty eight teams which ended September thirtieth\nThe individual income tax is expected to bring in roughly one point seven trillion or about ... excuse me half of all federal revenues according to the congressional budget office if past the ... statistics can offer any guidance\nAnd twenty sixteen one point for four trillion dollar income taxes were paid by a hundred and forty point nine million taxpayers reporting a total of ten point to trillions adjusted gross income\nSo what does this look like\nWell here's how it breaks down the top one percent\nPaid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven forty three percent than the bottom Ninety percent the top one percent payday greater share of into an individual income taxes than the bottom Ninety percent\nSo how can you tell me it's not all they're not paying their fair share\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers pay Ninety percent Ninety seven percent of all the individual income tax top half of taxpayers paid Ninety seven percent of all the income tax in other words the bottom fifty percent pay three percent\nWhich small percentile of taxpayers also pay three percent or more\nYou might have guessed that is the top zero point zero zero one percent or about fourteen hundred taxpayers that group alone pay three point two five percent of all income taxes\nOn the top zero point zero zero one percent pay almost three and a half percent of the income taxes but we're not we're not charging the rich enough votes\nIn twenty two thousand one the bottom fifty percent\nPay nearly five percent whereas the top zero point zero zero one percent of fibers pay to point three percent so uh it's ... the top one hundredths of one percent a one size that one hundred and one thousand ten thousand of one percent\nThey're paying more now that we're in two thousand\nThey're paying more in income taxes now that they were in two thousand\nThe individual income tax system is designed to be progressive those with higher incomes paying a higher rate while the ... or the duck reduction in the ... of the progressive if the curve is visible at the highest levels\nSo we see the share of adjusted income and the sheer of total income tax\nAnd you've seen\nIs just unbelievable the top what we've always\nTold your top five percent paying sixty percent of the income that may be even more than that now the average tax rates paid for the for the very wealthiest has fallen in recent years from a peak of twenty four point one percent\nIn twenty Thirteen to twenty two point nine percent in twenty sixteen and it was a full four points below the twenty six point nine percent of the top one percent paid on average ... their bemoaning that fact but just thinking about that for\nJust a second and we're we're looking at um the top percentage folks I mean they're paying whereas we told you the top three percent are paying more than half of the income tax\nBut no no no we have to taxis people more and\nI think that the although you couldn't quote this on the screen you know you go talk to somebody I think they know this now they've heard\nAnd I'm Talking about your rank and file person out there they heard that the rich aren't paying their fair share but when you start really digging into it and you ask folks I think they instinctively know that's not true\nEven so this is the even bigger\nA development from all this\nThey don't care they don't care I've often said it says so much about you when you're more concerned about those making more than you than those making less and the liberals are consumed\nWith how much people are making that make more than they do they're consumed with how much the rich are making oh it's not fair it's not the assumption is if we could take that from the rich and give it to the poor that everything would be fine no the poor would blow it\nThe poor would blow it this is something I Can't even say in polite company but I Do anyway and that is most poor people are poor because of poor choices\nAnd when he said well how can you say that the same way I can say the most most rich people are rich because of smart choices and they are it's about the choices we make I Would be a lot richer if I made some really smart choices but I didn't I made some dumb thing I've done okay but I've made some stupid choices along the\nWay an eye on it and my wife will tell you why do we do that I'm well you know I thought [laughter] that was your problem uh I think this is something I've made some dumb choices and it all boils down to that\nLook at what you're buying on a monthly basis weekly daily basis what did you buy today it's the same thing goes with um\nYou know with with ah or whether you're healthy or not what was your choices while it's not my fault yes it is one of the law but I live in a food desert no you don't there's no such thing in this country is a food desert for crying out loud there's no reason\nYou can't eat healthier than you're eating now you just don't want to\nAnd I will count myself I tried to do the best I possibly can but I could always do better and this is what I Want to tell people I may tell these folks I'm Talking to one thirty I don't know I mean it depends on you know I just I I just go off you know they just crack me up forty five minutes and then just\nTell me when to shut up because I got a lot better but it basically will boiler down to this if you want to be richer in America stop being stupid okay don't blame me\nDon't blame Trump don't blame all the rich people don't blame anybody but yourself if you want to do better in this country is specially now in this economy this is your time\nThis is your moment in history you will not have a better opportunity\nTo better you're a lot in life than right now with this economy the way things are going now and if you don't smart enough and take advantage of it its own you don't sit around there I think that's going to go over with these folks on Thursday and some sort of run into by you folks [noise]\nI don't know because they told me they said look here's the deal you know we got people from all over the country really in many cases all over the world are we want you to tell us you know all this stuff but don't don't really beat up the liberals too much and I said well I don't need to be that the liberals this is a common sense thing\nThis economy is now positioned\nThat if you want to take advantage if there were ever a time that you wanted to say okay when am I going to whether it's get richer and I'm not saying that you'd actually be rich because I you know that's not what people want all the time I mean that's the assumption to from the left or they're not rich they're not happy\nI think that's the but anyway but if you want to better you're a lot in life if you\nHi I'm Joe a doctor legit we can handle all your electrical needs from installing ceiling fans

is a piece\nFrom news busters who go to Google\nDot com\nIs an Asian American author of New York times column claiming that ending discrimination against Asian Americans in college admissions would actually do them agree just harm\nIt's not simply the New York times found an Asian American willing to write a column in the context of the lawsuit against hardwood\nSupporting continued discrimination against Asian Americans in college admissions is this law in my lease a cold you know it's absolutely mind boggling she writes ill\nSaving race as a consideration in admissions would cause egregious harm to people of color including Asian\nAmericans now if you don't know about the Harvard thing what is happening is you're finding the Asians are getting discriminated against because they're saying that they have too many Asians at Harvard\nNow\nWe're talking about something that should be based on merit and you know how it is I don't want to stereotype but Asian Americans tend to be over achievers do you notice that or not and you say this oh you're a racist come up with that we're going to complement folks and now you're raises but everybody knows it's\nAsian Americans are disproportionately in universities not because of affirmative action but because for some reason they performed very well now I don't know whether it's a\nFamily thing or a cultural thing I have no idea it just is and you see them as these you know the smart universities it's like every time we see a Carolina do game and they pan the crowded Kamron indoor stadium\nIt's about half Asian because Duke has a lot of Asians go there and it's not because they have is not because of affirmative action on the nose so in the harbor thing they say will get too many Asians we need some black folks and Hispanics in and the agents place\nAnd they're going are you serious we're we're the ones who are making the graves and doing what we're supposed to do now you say we can't come we now you have an Asian who's arguing the yeah yeah yeah that's right we have too many Asians and we're really so they write a news buster so ending discrimination against Asian Americans\nWould you agree just harm to them right\nAnd the war and mores piece freedom of slavery and ignorance is strength\nSomewhere the author of Nineteen eighty four was laughing but it was two years\nSo they call them through the column looking for the argument in support of the assertion that ending discrimination against Asian Americans would actually causing great harm and they found nothing instead cold the author offered examples of how she had been mistaken for other Asian Americans in her high school\nAnd how that made a very [laughter]\nAren't you sue ... no no no no no no I'm not suit land for crying out loud [noise] my name is Lisa co oh sorry about man she mentions\nThat when Mayor Bill de Blasio New York proposed eliminating be specialized high school admissions test to diversify New York city's specialized schools which are generally majority Asian and real until the few black and Latino students some Asian American parents criticized the proposal as anti Asian\nWell of course they would with me\nSo you've got something based on you take a test if you score high on the test you get in and then too many Asians are getting into going well\nWith is is this test is crap man we got to do something about this so we got to scrap the test and we've got to put some black folks and Hispanics and stuff she makes a pitch\nFor Asian Americans quote to imagine and fulfill our own radical futures\nWhatever that supposed to me\nSo here we have a minority which was Asian Americans who now actually finding themselves discriminated against why because they over achieve remember I had this discussion about Jews last week\nOr ... ... email about the bowl or the middle one\nGuy who's very nice guy and and but he ... he said when stew who I said I you know I could uh pretty much figured he was Jewish they sort of cringe when you said that he said you can't joke with them about that I mean even Germans used one thing that's funny I said\nI Lived amongst the Jews I Know Jews thinks funny for crying out loud I mean I had best friends were Jews run in Philadelphia I mean you see this is the problem is when you start to handle people with kid gloves kid gloves because you think oh I may offend them see I treat everybody the same and if you'll like it screw you that's\nJust the way I look at it not him not running the email just seen anybody if a Jew got mad at me because the way I was joking with Stu then get over it\nWouldn't it be a better place we actually treated everybody like we want to be treated\nAnd is that a golden rule or something I don't know\nIt seems so basic and so easy doesn't it\nBut we've got people who are now offended on behalf of somebody else don't be you don't need to be the Jews can take care of themselves through the assumption\nIs is that if I made the Jews man and so now you've got to be upset about it you don't have to be upset about it at\nThe Jews are mad at me they'll tell me believe you me they'll tell me

US Code Fifteen oh three\nWhich broadly defines the crime of corrupt Lee in depth bring to influence obstruct or impede the new administration of justice this on the bus provision however is most properly used for judicial proceeding such as grand jury investigations\nAnd the Supreme Court has narrowly construed that provision there's also Eighteen us cold Fifteen twelve ... paragraphs see you all know that when you probably read that last night didn't you\nIt makes it a crime Bernie person knew corrupt Lee or otherwise obstruction\nWen says room teams any official proceeding or attempts to do so\nBut this provision has been narrowly construed as well on the underlying code and the need for some official proceeding\nMuller should be fully aware of that problem since his principal deputy Andrew Weissmann was responsible for over extending that provision in the jury instruction that led the Supreme Court to reverse the conviction and the Arthur Andersen case in two thousand five so\nChances are Muller is fully familiar with how far you can go with that and it does not include going after drug so in other words the earliest saying\nThese and other provisions simply do not make for a compelling case against Trump\nWhile Trump has shown breathtakingly poor judgment in firing combing him publicly attacking investigators\nThat's not obstruction moreover Trump had independent grounds to fire comb including many of the reasons cited by Rod Rosenstein in his scathing criticism of called me and twenty Seventeen put simply this is not what an Obama looks like so\nIt looks like we're nearing the end of this investigation my question on this is will it come before the November ... elections are\nProbably not because I don't think Mueller wants to look like he's painting the elections either way I Would think that it probably will not come before November six\nBut it looks like it's coming soon and I would think probably shortly after and you can write this down folks shortly after the November elections their flag and the tape and they're just on a shortly after the November elections Mueller's going to have some sort of\nConclusion on this whole Russia probe and what's going to be interesting is it's probably going to amount to nothing\nAnd further interest is this a lot of folks on the right who have been just chewing this guy up one side and others are going to have them as a humorous [laughter]\nOh monitor what ended what integrity this guy has I mean he went through the whole process that is due diligence and then found out there was nothing there and was man enough to admitted\nNo I had been very careful about completely trashed and the guy I'd go back and forth on what could be going on behind the scenes I think that it's unseemly\nBecause you've had Muller enroll Rod Rosenstein and combing a working together before and it didn't turn out too well I've written column on them but that's not to say that that's necessarily what's going on here\nWe will just have this heightened wait I guess and see what comes up with\nAnd if he comes up with some trumped up if you'll pardon the expression charge against the president that I guess the president's gonna have to deal with them but there is no collusion obviously\nAnd then the left keeps one will look at all these arrests they may look at all these indictments of indictments for what for Manafort for tax evasion or whatever\nFor I'm Mike Flynn for a supposedly quote unquote lying to the FBI even call me said that was stupid to go after him on that it was a technicality they were trying to catch him on\nWhich really doesn't have anything to do with any kind of collusion what about um uh oh what's his name Papadopoulos yeah what do you get like three days in prison or something for lying to the FBI\nAnd again that was not lying about any kind of collusion that was lying about what he had had what kind of relationship he'd had with the Russians\nThey can't tennis thing on Trump because there's not a thing the\nFolks can you not just come to the conclusion that Hillary ran a horrible campaign that it it was hers to lose and she lost it that she did not realize that she could get out flanked in Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio and Wisconsin she thought she had those in the bag and who tried to tell her that\nI tried to tell her I tried to tell she she's leaving her back like on a noticed and unguarded and and then Trump to stay within Clinton ... well that's exactly what happened\nAnd I tell you I thought for the world during the last week of the campaign that Trump and his people lost their mind what are they doing in Michigan\nWhat are they what are they doing in pencil [laughter] we have those but they knew they were in striking distance and they knew in order to when they had to win one of those along with Florida and they felt like they probably had Florida in the bag it was an interesting gamble on their part\nIt was an equal equally interesting gamble on Hillary's part but it was all ... election theatrics it wasn't anything to do with Russia you\nKnow last night [noise] matter of fact we have any of the ... we got the cuts that we've seen through their Luther on the on Trump and sixty minutes because last night we'll get to those in the moment\nIt was interesting because Leslie stall just tried to pin him on all sorts of things and she asked him about the Russian collusion with the rest of and he said well China's trying to interfere too will play that for you in a moment it is interesting and I told you all along you know China\nIs our biggest enemy but nobody in here we have now the department of homeland security saying folks China is trying to screw with the midterm elections and the left out there oh\nPlease come on who wants to believe that you expect us to believe that well you're the ones who were crying the Russians were trying to metal and they were they didn't successfully but they tried\nI can guarantee you in twenty sixteen the Chinese were trying even harder\nBut everybody wants to focus on Russia because they made that the narrative right Trump and Russia collusion yeah and nothing there and I'm just telling me
