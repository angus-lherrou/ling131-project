it's our understanding will be conducted under standard political\nNo ice skate\nApparently as an undergrad student at Yale Brett Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a bar in New Haven Connecticut during which he was accused of throwing ice on another patron\nOh my gosh oh my gosh what I tell you\nLast week so the accusations are gonna be forthcoming and more outlandish by the day so now we have this is why he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court he threw ice it some guy in a bar brawl next thing you know\nBrett Kavanaugh started a food fight in the cafeteria tonia do we want John Belushi on the Supreme Court and I don't think so\nGood great this is all they got well it's not all they got this is the one where they're going out on now they're saying that the that Brett Kavanaugh does not have the judicial temperament to be on the Supreme Court you know why because of the way he taught disrespect\nFully to the senator's well\nI saw this over the weekend was jealous brand Gillibrand whatever the chick name and she's saying he was disrespectful to the senators\nAnd I said senator you need to understand something you work for him you work for us not the other way around you or disrespect for it\nYou accuse the guy of running a gang rape rain while he was in high school for crying out loud you think he's going to sit there and take it so if you're gonna accused him of this kind of stuff I Can't believe he didn't cost every one of you folks out including Spartacus himself so this is where we are\nNow how dare you beat this district where senators for God's sake\nYou're supposed to show us some respect well how about showing him some respect see another to you know in in in order to garner respect you have to show what you do not accuse somebody\nAnd support allegations that he was running a gang rape bring in high school and then expect the guy to show you respect when you meet him face to face get over it\nYou're a senator you work for us we don't work for you he doesn't work for you you show him respect because we're the ones paying your paycheck\nYet that okay let's get back to me when\nIn executing their delay delaying the lane strategy this for National Review against President Trump's domination of the eminently qualified Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court\nOr the most blatantly political claim posted by the Democrats as their objection to his purported lack of judicial temperament the\nIdea is that because judge Kavanaugh reacted with indignation this lenders that were that he was a gang rape is and because he observed is that they ought to bash left wing smears against them were well left wing smears he's unfit to be an objective\nJurist as opposed or a normal human being and a perception of perceptive wanted that of course the best measure we have\nOf how someone will perform in a government office is how the person is already performed when in that office or in very similar ones\nAnd the best measure we have the seriousness of good faith of the critics claim against the nominee is whether the critic consistently levels similar charges and analogous situations on that score the same note the following and this is from Andrew McCarthy and the national review\nBrett Kavanaugh's but a judge or a dozen years on one of the most important judicial tribunals in this country the United states court of appeals for the DC circuit\nIn that office not only has he issued over three hundred opinions what'd you been broadly admired for their craftsmanship and heavily relied on by the Supreme Court and other federal court\nHe's also been widely praised for his judicial temperament by litigants colleagues and bar association's which by the way the a BA is now\nRecounting their earlier oh we don't know whether it's having all guy to yeah we indoors this guy he's the man\nThe diverse group of clerks he has men toward has been in high demand for Supreme Court clerk ships and other distinguished positions and the legal profession his judicial temperament could not be more parent\nBy contrast here is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg speaking about Donald Trump he's a fake or he has no constituency\nAbout him a consistency no ... consistency of ...\nA says he has says whatever comes to his hand at the moment he really has an ego\nHow has it gotten away with not turning over his tax returns that was Ruth Bader Ginsburg guy Benson\nGuide Benson reminds us of some similarly in judicious remarks by Justice Ginsburg then the New York times interview Ginsburg doesn't hold up thing back when it comes to the twenty sixteen election\nShe said quote I Can't imagine what this place would be I Can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump is our president\nFor the country it could be four years for the court it could be I don't even want to contemplate that\nShe also recall something her late husband set about such matters now it's time for us to move to New Zealand I wanted to put her on the Supreme Court New Zealand that she moved now this is somebody who's supposed to be impartial how about judicial temperament they're a nobody has anything to say about that on the left\nAnd then he says Andrew McCarthy if they practice consistency\nKavanaugh's critics would be calling for Ginsburg to step down or the very least to recuse himself from any case in which a component of the Trump Administration as a party before the court\nBut of course she continues to participate fully then Kavanaugh's critics are glad of it they despise Trump as much as she does their sky is falling attack on Kavanaugh's character is a reflection of Ginsburg sky is falling forecast of the Trump presidency and its portends for the court\nThat is it's all political and it is\nSo what did I tell you last week when I was telling you would need to have an FBI investigation and you were all going no no this is horrible ... you're just you're you're one of them now and I heard all this stuff I did hear from a lot of you are going well now I've heard your argument on this I think you're probably right\nYeah I think it's a well we'll see by the end of the week but here's how it's shaping up yesterday we had a poll actually over the weekend that came out\nThat shows us that half of the voters in Missouri where Claire McCaskill is a senator\nAre less inclined to vote for her now because she's opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation half of the voters\nIn the state of Tennessee Phil Bredesen is too chicken to even voice an opinion on the matter because he knows it is the proverbial third rail and politics if he says he supports Kavanaugh ...\nFolks go nuts if he says he opposes Kavanaugh then all of the people who were may be thinking about crossing the island voting for him as Republicans voting for a Democrat or going to vanish so he's in no man's land now\nSay the reason I wanted an FBI investigation is because these folks thought the Kavanaugh was going to withdraw his nomination he didn't\nAnd the more confirmation we get to the Senate Judiciary committee's findings on miss Ford were correct from the beginning of the stamp of approval from the FBI the better it looks for Kavanaugh but moreover the better it looks to the American\nPeople and that's what's important here especially in states like West Virginia Indiana I'm Missouri some of these places North Dakota without a hike in\nSome of these places where there are Democrats in seats that are in Trump country because now they can't win and\nThe only way that that this thing has a happy ending for any of these folks as if they vote for Kavanaugh so here's my prediction for you and I'm not going to be I'm not going to hold tight this I'm just\nSaying it is possible that by the end of this week\nWe may lose Jeff Flake and pick up three four or more Democrats voting for Kavanaugh at that point it looks like and will be a bipartisan confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nAt the Democratic candidate in their local race for the U.S house\nForty two percent support the Republican candidate at the poll also shows the Democrats league has

on and we're where we're headed this week a couple of things can derailed if mark judge PJ writes a BJ Smith and a legal in ... or whatever name is now\nIf they changed their testimony from the written testimony is we've got a problem oh by the way I've been asking this and I found this out\nWe're stimulus house you remember to me this is fraught that some of the folks on the left\nWe're hanging their hand on this we had this entry in Kavanaugh's calendar from that summer in question\nAnd he was meeting PJ and ah and mark judge and a ... and and a couple of other folks over it Tim Means house and you remember I was asking this why don't we just find out where Tim nice houses\nWell the folks on Dr forward side didn't seem to be real curious about that they didn't press that point they didn't want to know where to him he's house was and now we know why Tim nice house was ten miles\nFrom the country club\nAnd the floor plan does not even closely resemble the floor plan of the house she said she was attacked been\nYou know how we found that lassie found Tiffany's yeah lassie found him he's house and he was in a well but um everything's going to be OK So Tim nice house\nTen miles from the country club\nThat was one of the last thing that I was worried about in all of this if they can find him he's house and it's two blocks from the country club but it matches the description interior wise of\nWhere she says she was then Kavanaugh's got a problem and got a problem to me south ten miles away doesn't resemble the how she says she was attacked and so that industry has a obviously little to do with what she was saying\nSo the only thing we're waiting on now is to see what mark judge is is Martin ...\nKeeps a margin\nHe and the rest of these folks say in their interviews with the FBI window judge has already been interviewed\nI don't know about the other ones now the Democrats in addition to a judicial temperament\nThey got a list of like twenty two twenty three other witnesses they want the FBI to witness and at this point you got to say no\nNo no no we're going to the allegations if you haven't heard this from a Julie sweat Mick\nAre crumbling too she did an interview with NBC and it's fallen completely apart what I don't know that um they're actually gang rapes going on I mean you know and some of the of the major points of her contention by the way she I Believe she gave a sworn deposition so ... was she lying\nWe also have the deal at the double door at the Ford residents which I told you about last week and now the mainstream media finally picked up while the mainstream I don't know why not real clear politics is pretty mean\nThey're starting to pick up on this to it appears that the double door the second door was not added in twenty twelve it was added in two thousand eight and it was for some Google folks to rent part of their house out which is illegal in Palo Alto\nAll they've got to do now is go over there and see if there's a wall between those two double doors if there's a wall between them it's a duplex and it was not put in because of her claustrophobia unless she's going to run through the wall or she gets really really really scared and go through the second door and I told you at the time\nThat makes no sense whatsoever to put a double door\nWell some people are saying well it it's just an added door on the door they got it's like a it's like a heavy second or what is now it turns out as a side by side door and why would you put a side by side door unless you're turning your house into a duplex so all they got to\nDo now if they do this and I don't even know the ... you need to do this I mean there's so much other evidence is piling up against this woman about lying about this that and the other uh but if they were to go to her house and find out there's a wall\nBetween those I guarantee your husband's over there with a with a sledgehammer right now and you go then is a big hole in the wall what oh oh no no no this is the way we wanted it now I Know it's sort of that rough look you know\nSo if they find a wall between those two double doors this woman was absolutely blatantly lying under oath and she ought to be prosecuted forward\nSo we've got the testimony from the Ramirez woman now she's saying well I couldn't say defended leaving the guy who showed me is when he was Brett Kavanaugh I think it was but you know I was really really drunk and I have some gaps in my memory from that night because I was so drunk\nSo that's falling apart Julie sweating next falling apart\nA Christine blondes a Ford all that's falling apart\nAnd if the witnesses that she says we're there you have the same testimony to the FBI they gave to the Senate Judiciary committee the clock has expired folks this things over\nMitch McConnell apparently believes that it's going to be over sooner rather than later 'cause he's calling for a vote this week\nSo again if you can get Lindsey Graham with some legal exhibits on an easel with a pointer and say you wanted\nAn FBI investigation and we gave you an FBI investigation and here's where the FBI investigation showed\nBoom boom boom boom boom\nLet's vote oh my gosh\nSee what this does and this is why I wanted an FBI investigation to start with is because this is and I know I'm repeating myself but\nIt needs to be said the FBI in the minds of millions of Americans splits a stamp of approval on what we already know it doesn't change what we know it just bolsters what we know it legitimize is what we know\nIf they had ... votes through last week\nOne of two things would have happened Kavanaugh may not have been confirmed for a he would have been confirmed that have been a shadow over this whole thing we wait a week\nWe give them enough rope to hang themselves and they do because they count on two things first plan a was Kavanaugh's going to withdraw his nomination because of all this with the ring\nOr they these withering accusations against and he's not he's not going to put his family through this because they know he's a decent guy but they didn't know that he was determined to regain his reputation they thought he just linked\nBack to court and just not fight the thing they also didn't realize this thing was gonna boomerang on them if Kavanaugh state in\nThought that they had the goods at least\nThe alleged goods and that the American people would buy it ended up being your Republicans would never go for an FBI investigation\nWhen I keep telling me last week from me and the briar patch\nThat was the call from the Democrats so what they wanted was\nTo vehemently demand to an FBI investigation\nAnd for the Republicans to say no we're not going to do it\nAnd then they say saying they're obviously hiding something while the Republicans gave it to him and now each accusation that comes out in the as I told you they're gonna be won practically every day the latest is the judge Kavanaugh while he was a junior at Yale through ice it somebody\nClick click click click\nWhat's the what's what's going to be tomorrow when he started a food fight judge Kevin ... wants to water balloons or the car\n[laughter]\nYou got some eggs in a house judge Kavanaugh once played ding dong ditch\nI mean it's getting more and more absurd and as it does these people go down the drain you can see I'm circling right now [noise]\nAnd uh you know and then they're gone\nAnd Kavanaugh's on the Supreme Court not only with the full support of almost all the Republicans flake may flake out on us\nBecause he's not up really leaving but\nWe may see some Democrats sewer certainly in some hotly contested states that are Trump country may come over and vote for cabinet all\nI Hope they don't actually I Hope it's a party line vote and that the Republicans win and cabinet gets confirmed that they can beat him over the head with it in November but this is all about putting the Republican Party on trial and what they thought is the Republican Party with several of the court\nAnd they didn't they thought they would pay them and they would look guilty and they didn't\nAnd they gave them everything they wanted and at the end of the day it looks now again it's only Tuesday\nSo we don't know what's gonna\nHappened my presumption from listening to Mitch McConnell\nThe heck medics and county line

sixty nine percent of voters polled called it a national disgrace who do you think there is racism\nIs going to the poll voters acknowledged partisanship on each end of the political spectrum with

sixty percent said that if the FBI investigation turns up nothing new he should be confirmed sixty seven percent or before thought Ford was credible\nFifty percent thought Kavanaugh was credible but now they're saying because the FBI investigation the sixty percent\nWill find cabin all credible and thinks he should be on the Supreme Court I'm just saying folks\n\nI Know the people and I know they they looked at this and I can look at this through their eyes to they're looking at this as a partisan process and it is on both sides the Republicans want the person and if the Democrats are in\nA in office with the president they want their person and the Republicans don't want that person and it's always political the Supreme Court nomination process is always political so the only way to\nTake the politics out of something as contentious as this is the bringing the FBI and that comes with its risks knowing what some of the folks in the FBI had done before\nBut I'm thinking with all eyes on

Alabama Europe next to Phil Valentine shy Josh\nHey help later speak with the same here sir\nToo quick point a number one it seems like ironically that Kavanaugh stuff is really kind of start the momentum for the Democrats as it relates to the Russia probe you are a Woodward book that came out\nAnd I think secondly it proves that or your whom I'm because they haven't released anything they calculate when they released stuff because they know what's going to be hit right now but Kavanaugh for\nWell that's that's exactly right I mean you know it it it is this cabinet thing is sucked all the oxygen out of the room\nAnd it shows that those guys pick their timing when they want to release stuff for their political advantage and I know they can do right now 'cause no one's going to pay attention to\nYou know one of my friends I have to run and in the meantime Chuck Schumer over there are ... in this room mates silver yeah people are getting this wrong Schumer restoring the sixty votes killed his filibuster would likely be cynical tactical poor to give cover the centrist Democrats\nIn twenty Nineteen twenty twenty of them is when the Senate in November idling around worried about that he's not going to be able to change the ... the the uh the Senate rules 'cause he will be in charge\nWhile I'm a trawler trail when will vote on what we'll we'll ... we'll just wouldn't go and vote by the way a Mitch McConnell left today without invoking cloture\nNo I don't understand I mean I Know a closure is but what they're saying is is that um he probably will not do that until tomorrow and when he does it sets\nThe table for debate on Thursday and vote on friday so if Mitch McConnell closes the Senate tomorrow with cloture on this confirmation thing\nUh that means that they're going to I guess the debate on Thursday and vote on friday and that means that the FBI report is probably coming tomorrow wouldn't that be interesting yeah [noise]\nOh this is just so\nThey

stopping the search and them at every county sheriff says have no doubt he will be captured it's a scary time for young men in America that's the word from President Trump today as the FBI investigate sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSays this which has been flipped for cabin are claiming he's been seen as guilty until proven innocent a reminder the new wireless emergency alert system will be tested it one Eighteen tomorrow afternoon people will get allowed tone and vibration on their smartphones across the U.S\nSenators will get the report soon after it is completed but it's not currently do to be released to the public the FBI has yet to interview Ford or capital so they're gonna wait until the end they'll probably ... they may do that tonight they may do it tomorrow morning but they're going to wrap it up tomorrow\nSo they're going to give the senators probably a report on Thursday and then they're going to be all looking at it and go okay\nIs it a pretty much says what we said before that he said she said she said they said and then they make\nTheir all their statements on the floor of the Senate and then they vote and this thing is over and sixty percent don't forget go under the Harris Poll today say that if the FBI investigation finds no new evidence against Kavanaugh he should be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nSo the folks from the Democrat side had a strategy and the strategy was this the strategy was\nWe're going to lie in wait\nFor Kavanaugh we're going to wait for the entire confirmation process to go through\nAnd then just before the votes were going to spring these allegations against him\nAnd it's going to start with Dr Ford and then we got a couple of other folks and as soon as the four thing hits they're going to be staggering and then we're going to hit him with another punch and it's going to be re mayor is and then they're going to be dropping to their knees and they get back up on them we're gonna grow boom\nWe're gonna hit him with this gang rape allegation from this Julie sweat Nick\nAnd Kavanaugh is going to withdraw because he is not going to subject is family to all this stuff they miscalculated Kavanaugh Kavanaugh's fighting for his reputation at this point they thought he would just go away he didn't\nAnd solved that the Republicans then move for votes we've heard from Dr Ford we've heard from Kavanaugh let's have a vote on this and they say no no no no no we want an FBI investigation never thinking that the Republicans would actually give them one\nAnd I told you days before a flake ever came forward this they need to give them the FBI investigation because the American people are now in doubt especially after Thursday's testimony of Dr Ford the American people were going well gosh\nI mean he may have done this\nGive him the investigation because the American people don't trust the political process now I Know a lot of you folks don't trust the FBI and that is a gamble you're rolling the dice\nIf you've got another Peters struck involved but I think with Chris Wray in at the helm of the FBI and their battered reputation I think that the FBI hierarchy is making darn sure there's no politicizing of this with the agents that are going out in the field and conducting the investigation\nAnd I guarantee you they put these people through the third degree to make sure they didn't have a political axe to grind against Trump or Fort Drum they don't want anything political so they send their people out\nThey ah interview the witnesses they do the investigation\nVast they have given me something [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] this is another indication that are there imploding bath stamped tells me CNN has dropped their Kavanaugh wall to wall coverage and they're now going wall to wall with is that the New York times as President Trump used dubious tax schemes to make a fortune in the Nineteen nineties [laughter]\nAnd I was three dollars a day I said you've gotten up and folks\nMeal ... says this is a little bit suspect I mean here we are now all the cabin off things not going like we want to list wipe it off the front pages and get it off the news we got to have something else to put that in people's minds before November Trump\nGot four hundred million dollars from his father and they they cheated people to get it and that's how he made his fortune that was a supposedly back in the Nineteen nineties well Trump made his fortune in the Nineteen seventies and eighties it's going to be really really hard\nTo make this stick plus I Would\nThink that the statute of limitations on anything like this a long expired here's what the story says with a New York times\nTrump earned the equivalent of more than four hundred million dollars by setting up a sham corporation to hide gifts from his father\nHad also claims Trump helped his father take millions and improper tax deductions Trump's parents allegedly transferred over a billion dollars of wealth to their children will pay just a fraction of the required tax is a lawyer for the president called the allegations faults and defamatory well it goes beyond that\nIt's we gotta have something now the white the Kavanaugh thing all Trump pages because we're getting hammered\nMeanwhile back to the Kavanaugh saying check this out\nWe now have a Republican senator who was a referring Julie sweat Nick to the FBI for making false statements about cabinet or Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy today\nSaid that the criminal referrals should be issue to the FBI to

Ninety nine seven WPN news sweater traffic and talk [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] it is\nBy one time show on the west was won radio networks [noise] well sweating the Jewish what makes it a an interview with NBC News in she's walking back some of the allegations NBC News\nSaying they can't really verify anything\nThat she said during the interview here to chat about that is Andrew Andrew for the Weekly Standard better known to us as the men [noise]\nAnd I am the walrus Andrew how are you\nI'm I'm I'm doing great how are you in my the only one that calls you they man my wife called me the\nKind of fun to hear [laughter] so she's the only me and your wife huh\nYeah yeah you have it too [laughter] that's\nInteresting well so tell us about this interview because uh I guess she walked back some of these allegations\nYeah I mean it was it was it was sort of desire to see it because it was not a particularly you know hard hitting interview that NBC did which usually sweating that come into the the the the interviewer was was you know relatively\nUm you know friendly and and just sort of asking you know the perks are pre softball questions [noise]\nUm but it but as you know the allegation that that ... and they made and her sworn testimony last Wednesday released through her attorney Michael I have an idea was that she had a specific knowledge that Brett Kavanaugh when he was in high school\nOrganizing these are pretty elaborate gang rape at high school a party that that he was you know conspiring with other with other boys\nOr to to drug the punch and uh and you know incapacitate girls at these parties and then spirit them away upstairs and and then there would be like a whole line of guys just sort of waiting on how to do it I'm really salacious really insane stuff like if if it were if it were you know true this would obviously\nAre not only derail Kavanaugh's nomination but you know be you know mentally profitable big deal allegations by a she goes on and be the last night and almost prompted a wants to turn that back says that says that you know she didn't have any specific firsthand knowledge\nThat Kavanaugh was doing any of these things just essentially said that she saw Kavanaugh you know near the punch at these parties said that she saw Kavanaugh you'll handing red solo cups to girls said that she saw you know boys like hanging out upstairs near doorway that these parties\nUh but but you know almost every extremely serious allegations of this sort that she made again in ... sworn affidavit or she walked back during the interview so it was just sort of bizarre to see you I mean we were aren't really expecting it this was not this is not like a well a corroborated allegation even prior to last night I mean I think\nMost people who have been following this saw this as definitely the weakest of the three ah but but I mean especially after last night I mean I don't I don't I don't think uh many Democrats are going to rush to make Julie sweat neck\nA centerpiece of you know they're they're a push against Brett Kavanaugh which you had seen some Democrats doing a prior to Monday\nWe'll was a ... he was he with her on this interview\nHe was not there with her he uh he he he himself\nGave a couple of interviews later on Monday Night which is essentially at least in my opinion it was sort of a form of damage control where uh [laughter] you know he he knew that interview and not gone over well ah so he was he he was sort of mop up and do what he said then how was that\nA slight Nick indeed had no first hand knowledge of these things from ... another friend of flat next had told sweat neck that it was a that it was Kavanaugh who was responsible for\nYou know these these alleged that the planning and execution of the alleged gang rape but this friend identity is unknown industry and I mean he did not volunteer her name uh there there was no mention of her\nOr of the fact that you know a sweating it was not speaking from her own first hand knowledge in the affidavit last Wednesday I and and I and why they're saying that I think really deserves to be pointed out here that [noise] it just seems kind of obvious hasn't really gotten a whole ton of traffic is that when you when you look at these allegations I mean like it's\nA start with the one with a Christine Blasey Ford and the one with Deborah Ramirez both those allegation you know that there are uncorroborated ... that you would even if they if they were true you would sort of expect them to be uncorroborated right because they took place
