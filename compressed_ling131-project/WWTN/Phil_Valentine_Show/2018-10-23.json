which he confirms that there are terrorists from Malaysia and other countries among the migrant Caribbean\nHe says I've had the opportunity to speak with both the secretary of homeland security as well as the president about this and I'll tell you what I can tell you publicly very importantly end this caravan are not just people from Honduras in Guatemala\nWe know that some of the people that are from countries across the entire globe there are what we use in the lingo SRAs special interest ... who pose a very real dangerous or a dangerous threat to the security of the United states of America\nSays um I've\nHeard about this with regards to terrorists coming from countries other than Malaysia and he says he's gotten confirmation that that is exactly what's going on so what are we going to do about the care of it\nWell I'm Glad you and I have no idea if I knew\nI Would tell you I think they probably got an action plan that these folks get here uh they say Seventy days I'm telling you is going to be a lot quicker than that they're they're being shoveled from town to town on flatbed trucks and an eight to ...\nSo it's unlikely\nOnly going to take them Seventy days the good here there'll be here probably in a week they're going to try to be I Would think and then we're gonna have to see what happens when they do get here and what we're\nAnd to do about it\nAnd anonymous game ... step forward today and released a shocking description of how he was sexually assaulted by senator Cory Booker back in twenty four team\nMan claims of Bulger came to his workplace to speak met him as he was coming out of the men's room and then pulled them back into the restroom and sexually assaulted them\nThe young man is game and he's a Democrat\nMan tells very detailed analysis on what took place that has worked demand says he reached out to Ronan Farrow but the meat to reporter didn't show any interest in his story the gateway pundit reached out to his attorney\nHarm meets Dylan who told them the man is considering the situation has no further comment at this time so yesterday the accuser posted accused Twitter or he accused Twitter shadow banning his tweets I actually tested it myself\nWhen I made my last post six hours ago and it certainly appears to be suppressed as of now it doesn't look to be the case anymore so says at Twitter was shadow band you know that is right they don't let you know the ... who can see your tweets we get this\nAll the time I Will to weed out some of them go well I Know how many Twitter followers were again now I don't know what I'm saying uh Eighteen point two thousand Twitter followers so I'll tweet out something that I Know everybody's seen and then I'll retweeted and retweeted and it gets no response\nThat I Know if you knew this you'll be going crazy goes to some of the left wing doesn't want anybody to know [noise] and it'll get one or two you know likes or you know whatever or re tweets and then that's it and I'm going Eighteen\nThousand folks out there and they're not they latch on to this I don't think so I don't think so for instance let me get on and it's even check this maybe take me admitted to find that\nYou remember um when was this yesterday or was that earlier I too have somebody sent me a picture\nOf this this uh yeah it was yesterday wasn't sent me a picture of this postcard is being sent out and um\nIt is a postcard that sent out and it's got vote November sixth year vote will matter more than ever I'm voting I'm volunteering to write this because the stakes are so high and want you to vote for Phil Bredesen is post Marc Boston\nIs\nHandwritten so we talked about this yesterday and we got people from Oregon and everywhere else they're saying yeah we are getting these things to turns out there's this\nFacebook page that was set up now they're saying this is organic and it and if it says grass roots and all this stuff\nHow many people have that kind of money to put postage stamp some images and you know you buy the card a but the expensive part is the postage on each one to send them all of the I mean there are tens of thousands of these things going on all over the country and they're saying well this is just a couple of volunteers is doing this\nWhat's your sources money of course but it's just a couple of volunteers\nSo I'm looking this I put this on Twitter and it got a hundred and Thirteen ... tweets hundred and Thirteen re tweets\nSo what's interesting is it wasn't I to me when you got Eighteen thousand folks in I re tweeted a couple of times you know hundred that's nothing you know a hundred and thirty one folks retweeted this thing and about a hundred and Thirteen\nPeople liked it and you can think there's some overlapping there they liked it and then re tweeted it so you got that going on\nSo I'm going okay well this seems rather suspicious so we put this thing on Facebook and on Facebook it got thousands of shares so\nWhat's the deal with Twitter my only conclusion is is that all most of those Eighteen thousand people never saw it even though we tweeted it and re tweeted it and ... they never saw it because somebody at Twitter doesn't want you to see it\nAnd that's the trouble some thing it would be one thing if Twitter told me up front hey we don't like you and conservative so we're not kill anybody see this and then I wouldn't waste my time\nBut on Facebook it got six thousand people that this thing reached and\nThey got all sorts of ... years and all sorts of comments that's just on one of our Facebook page is the one that we can\nSee the stance the other and we can't even see the sense so you can bet and the other and we have more people probably you know I Would say at least I don't know six seven eight thousand people reached which is understandable out of it you know Eighteen thousand\nBut you've got Eighteen thousand people follow him on Twitter and only a hundred and thirty one feel motivated enough to either like it or retweeted that's because most of the Eighteen thousand never saw it and they don't want you to see it again when it comes to Twitter Facebook and things like this I'm a big believer\nAnd this is the private market you know I mean if you want to do this but you need the law needs to be that you if you're going to do this kind of thing you need to tell people up front so we don't waste their time with you will feel you know they're left wing well I Know but I mean there are campaigns out there\nWith me in a no big deal if somebody didn't read sweet my thing 'cause it's not going to mean anything to me but if you're running for office and part of your strategy is social media and then you don't know that half the stuff you're putting on social media as being ... by some social media giant out they didn't want anybody to see it\nWhat does that do as far as the campaign is concerned your message does it get out\nThat's where we got this new trouble folks\nThat's where we need that's where we need some sort of law for full disclosure I you know again it's a private company they want a frontal conservatives they want to kick in certain fine but listen to all this stuff up front before we start wasting our time sending out a bunch of stuff on a campaign where we're trying to reach voters\nIn the meantime it registering a dead people down in Texas so you know and they're probably waiting\nYou know [laughter] by the way what happens once you were to see what happens to your Twitter account what was your Facebook again as you said there forever\nWant you to say she has a lot of people that we know over the years that have actually passed away their their pages are still up pages are still up yes so somebody would have to take it down I guess yes and I guess probably they didn't share their you know as we're yet it has ... and all that so that that the pages stays active\nYeah so you're immortalized on social media on Facebook and again as\nA second caravan is coming behind the first one now folks we have a migrant caravan heading for the U.S a thousand Hondurans crossing into Guatemala behind the first group of seven thousand into Mexico so this is going to continue\nMonday proved to be successful for those on the caravan of almost ten thousand members the departed from a southern Mexico City of ah ... is that I pronounce that with a smaller group trailing behind having inter Guatemala from Honduras late Sunday night according to the show she depressed\nAlthough it's unclear exactly when the second group began to form it's believed to have been somewhere near San Pedro Sula were the first group began\nSo the folks at judicial watch are trying to get to the bottom of this I Would take myself to San Pedro Sula\nAnd start nosing around down there and see where this thing starts if you see some folks started to congregate look around find somebody with a megaphone and some folks with tents set up and everything else and then start asking some questions where are you folks ah who's funding you and all that probably won't get an answer from them but if you stick around long enough\nYou know I Would think with the CIA that we have that's in every corner of the globe somebody's going to hear something about who's funding this thing and I'm telling you it's going to be some left wing organization like sorrows\nThat is funding this thing to send these people to the border to create chaos well look and I'm not joking about this could be the Russians it could be the Russians it could be the Chinese it could be the Iranians all three of those countries have been identified\nBy our intelligence apparatus as trying to screw with us and creating a discontent discord and drive a wedge between the American people so it would very well could very likely it could be one\nThose countries is helping to back this as well but somebody's doing this is not just saying hey man you want to go

of nationalist political parties in Europe and it had a double banging twenty sixteen as empowered brings it in the u._k. and the election of Donald Trump in the U.S so there's something wrong with nationalism it but it was ... and shrimp\n\nDon't you know why why don't they left to start a ... you know where they're getting out of the United states I mean there's you know there's a plane leave with every hour for crying out loud why don't shoot practice a ... and head for the exit\nSteve Bannon Trump's former top strategist said Trump used an economic nationalist agenda when it's also a word that means different things to different people\n[noise] whole being Miller a senior fellow with the Atlantic council's\nScowcroft Center for strategy and security told CNN [noise] there are different definitions depending on whose nationalism you're talking about scholars generally differentiate between civic an ethnic slash sectarian nationalism that is between rooting American identity and the ideals of the American experiment\nVersus ruining it in some aspect of our cultural heritage history language or ethnicity\nCivic nationalism is the same as what I Would call patriotism and it is essential to a healthy democracy the second kind of nationalism sectarian nationalism is pernicious and dangerous\nBut rye Heene ... a former senior advisor to ... leader nine ... rejects the second more negative definition of nationalism nationalism is not inherently ugly he says it is in fact inherently beautiful he's currently a federal it'd be fellow at the middle east for him\nHe told CNN nationalism is a philosophy based around either of the nation state what we know locally as countries or around another identity factor which will be religion ethnicity geography or even interests\nIn the case of President Trump's he has no doubt using the word to outline his belief in a nation of people unified by believes interest in common history\nThis is typically what nationalism is meant since the earliest references to it in human history though there have no doubt been periods where nationalism just like socialism or other philosophies has been used a divide rather than unite which is ironically the antithesis of its purpose\nSo they want to know what the national is believing how about the the country that's a good place to start\nNationalist primary belief is if people in similar societies benefit when they are United by shared values and a common belief system\nCause some says uniting people whether under flags banners anthems or constitutions\nIs conducive to a more robust civic society and stronger communities so what's the love about it oh but Miller dismisses that is in coherent ideology Miller says no one has ever been able to agree on what defines the nation it is impractical because there was no feasible way to make\nGovernments overlap exactly with all the supposed ... nations in the world today\nWell they're missing the point entirely we're not worried about the other nations and what they may call nationalism nationalism is what you call nationalism in your own nation that is why they call it nationalism instead of international ism but let me explain to you just briefly\nAh ladies and gentlemen of the audience what we have in common as Americans it's called the constitution you can read it it'll tell you exactly what we have in common\nWe have an income and the rights to free speech the right to freedom of the press the right to practice whatever religion we want to practice their right to keep and bear arms\nThe rights to redress the right to all of these things that are in the bill of rights and all through the constitution of what it is the means to be an American if you're going to be a Christian you named all read the New Testament Old Testament what helping New Testament is where you live if\nYou want to be a Jew you need to read the ... if you want to be an American you need to read the constitution it's as simple as that it is the life plan for people who are citizens of this country if you're going to be a citizen of another country and be a nationalist there then you're going to be looking\nAt another documents but if you're going to be an American and you call yourself a nationalist and I agree that the people on the left have made this a dirty word but it's rather funny to me the Trump is tweaking them with it because\nThey look to the dictionary definition and the dictionary definitions as a person devoted to nationalism a a devotion and loyalty to one's own country\nOne is there to argue about what that you're probably a native is too yeah I probably am\nIf you want to get at the basic definition of a native is I Want to put the people in this country first and it doesn't it's not about a race it's about people\nThe people of America come first you know why\nBecause it's where we live and we pay taxes so that we can have a\nMilitary defense that protects all the people in this country so yes we come first and ... and we come first when it comes to\nAn illegal invasion coming up from Honduras so if I'm against the folks coming in from Honduras illegally and my ... absolutely I Am and my native is sure\nWhy in the world would I Want them to be better off at the expense of us well doesn't that make you a greedy\nThat make you a a cold hearted conservative no it's a reality I Can't save everybody in the world\nLet me ask you this are you more concerned about the people living in your house in your family then you are the neighbors next door well of course you are\nSo if mayhem breaks out what are you gonna do you're going to run out the front door and make sure that John and Mary next door you okay you get everything you name or you're going to hunker down with your own family and make sure that the bad guys in the ... don't get\nThem or what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's anything wrong with that you take care of your own first and then if you can go help John and marry after you secure as your own family than you do\nBut there is nothing in the world sinister about Trump's saying he's the national is we're all national or we should be unless you're one of these socialist international is and what you want to do is you want to screw up this country and bring everybody in here that has no business coming in here\nAt the expense of everybody was already here\nWhat does that make you an idiot that's what makes you\nWho in the world wants to take care of everybody else in the six billion or seven billion whatever we got at the expense of everybody in the United states\nI think that makes you trader actually\nWe are in the United states for ... and some of us were born here some of us immigrated here some were born citizen some chose to be citizens\nBut we're all in the same boat and its allies boats and what do you want to do drill a hole in the bottom of it\nOr what do you want to try to do swamp it with all the other people that that are in another life both they want to get an hours it's not like they're drowning\nIt's just that they're voting as nice as ours but we can't take all those people in our boating it won't hold all of them it'll sink our boat it'll destroy our both now what we can do with our boat is we can go help these folks\nThat are falling over the side give back up and their boats\nWe can maybe throwing some supplies and stuff but if all those people in that both getting there but we're all gonna die\nAnd that's the whole point of legal immigration you let everybody in the world who wants to come here just stream into the country it no longer is the United states of America we can no longer help the other folks\nWe've got all of this wealth all of this large as not because we're greedy but because of our system of government if we let people come in that aren't producing\nEnergy just wanting to climb on the boats they're going to sink it\nAnd for their sake and our sake we can't let them do it\nAnd that's the whole point about the care of and oh yeah I'm sure there are a lot of folks who are running from violence and poverty in Honduras but they're also running from violence and poverty in all over Africa and in Bangladesh and an Indian every and some of those folks over there and the care of it\nWe can't possibly take everybody in those countries in which wasn't if we wanted to and we shouldn't work to what we should want to do is to keep our boat strong and keep it floating and keep it secure so that we can help them secure their own boats\nDoes that make any sense you liberals on there I Hope it doesn't we're getting you still there [noise] you know there has exploded quick time out\nEight hundred so Valentine's of

it quite interesting now\nFlorida you folks in Florida you need to pay special attention to this tweeted this debate but this was all the film at one time I come under show prep a Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron dissenters trapped his Democratic counterpart Andrew Gillum over his views on immigration\nAnd this was during a debate on Sunday matter of fact Luther Omaha I'm having to call an audio audible here I'm going to send this audio to you it'll be listed as audio\nAnd there's a link and you can run it it runs off um and it was a run off of I think it runs off\nA Twitter feed this down there from CNN CNN was was hosting the debate and I want you to listen to this because\nAh Gillum who's a Democrat trying to portray himself\nAs not being far left on this issue\nOf vote what to do about criminal illegal aliens now we all know what you need to do these criminal illegal aliens get out of prison ice has been waiting for him to get out of prison and ice wants these folks to turn them over to them they they have a painter forum they want him turned back over to ice so ice can deport them\nAnd Gillum doesn't want to do that he wants to turn them loose in the United states they're illegals by the way\nThey've killed somebody rapes somebody they've been sentenced to prison they do their time what happens when they get out Gillum and the Democrats want to just turn them loose in the general population of the United states\nOr run to Sanders says no we need to give these people back to ice ... ice throw him out of the country like they were supposed to do\nNow you do want him to serve their time if they've committed crimes in the United states they go to prison but once they're done with prison it's like oh we've done our time now we get to just stay in the United states there's still handling goes a so here's how the exchange went the other night with Ron descent as an Andrew Gillum\nNot playing you know OK Luther says it's not blame them reason\nWe've got to we've got slow computer problems yeah let me know if you get it up there they're Luther\nAh Jake well let me set of Jake Tapper says gentleman there an estimated eight hundred and fifty thousand undocumented immigrants living in the state of Florida mayor ... let me start with you\nYou say the Florida must be a welcoming state for all people does that mean to the eight hundred and fifty thousand undocumented immigrants living here should be granted US citizenship\n\nHe has no relationship with the truth what were you on or a request from Donald Trump's ice age and see if they provided the taint of requests will you honored as governor while you're worried about Donald Trump yesterday I received with your time\nHe won't answer them Jake that's important because that's what happens when Saturday at five and I'm probably consider I've worked with law enforcement when they're in the system they're convicted that maybe they serve ten years but it comes time to come out there's a painter requests from ice\nYou either turn him over to ice or release them into the community that's the only two options Andrew will not answer the question for me let me would be willing to release entered into the well of course I I just\nThink that the show voting is necessary or what what what what we will do is we will follow the law if\nMen of crime you do that time is through the Utica toy process in a judge issued a warrant for arrest or the movement and to an ice facility where I think what we would follow by the way what the Congress medicine chest thing it's already been determined by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional I mean I Want to I Want him at all now that I wanted to find out\nIf that's not true what Gillum is saying is\nIf some judge says that they can be handed over to ice and there'd be handed over dogs but the law says once you've done your time you're an illegal alien you need to be thrown out of the country Gillum won't do that and he just said he wouldn't do that he says if a judge says to do that that he'll do it well that's not the way it works it works through the process that ice\nIssues are detained for an illegal alien who's in prison and says as soon as this guy's relief if you release them early we warned them if they do their full time we warned them what we want him for is to throw them out of the country Gillum won't will let them do that if he's governor of Florida saying how dangerous that is you folks down in Florida\nI Can't believe this guy is running ahead of the sand is in the polls it blows my mind\nHow can this be in the state of Florida you folks down there and you've got to do something about this this guy because he's going to get in as governor and every elite eight hundred and fifty thousand\nIllegal aliens are living in the state of Florida and Gillum wants to let them stay I don't know how many of those are in prison but when they get out after doing their time for serious crimes and then you want he does [noise]\nThey'll let him stay I don't think so I don't think so so that's where we are on it it's just um it's ridiculous and you folks in Florida need to know what's going on because if this guy gets in this is the way it's going to be now Jeff Sessions\nIs seeking to expand power for him on the immigration cases right now they have something called a board of immigration appeals\nAnd he wants to bypass that matter of fact he wants to he wants to take action before some of these cases get to the board of immigration appeals cause everything gets bogged down in the bureaucracy under the new proposal the attorney general could make rulings on immigration cases before they get to the bureau of the board of immigration appeals\nTom says president general counsel at the mouth death that's the Mexican American legal defense and Educational Fund says it's very disturbing oh it's just that we're talking about ... again illegal aliens\nHe argued that proposed change which was included in the fall semi annual regulatory agenda released by the White House\nWould give the attorney general too much power he says this is an attorney general that has already demonstrated when he has done this under existing rules that he is biased inhumane and frankly probably influenced by some racist views of course he's a racist\nDepartment of justice spokesman Sarah Sutton called the sentences are characterization absurd and willfully ignorance she says it is widely acknowledged\nThat our immigration system is broken and the attorney general has been steadfast in his pursuit of a lawful and functional immigration system we're all Americans can thrive says the department of justice is record\nDemonstrate the commitment to the safety and security of all Americans while treating all persons with fairness and dignity do suggest otherwise is to ignore the facts this all from the hill today\nThe notice in the regulatory agenda which maps out an agency actions for the coming year\nSaid the cases where the attorney general could intervene would include quote those pending before the board of immigration appeals but not yet decided and certain immigration judge decisions regardless of whether those decisions have been appealed to the CIA\nPlans for the proposed rule were first listed on the spring regulatory agenda in may\nAt that time they

nine seven WPN news weather traffic and talk [noise]\nThe ah\nHey this film Amazon show on the west would one radio ...\nThem more listening you we\nGenerally littered Washington Examiner mix big test for Obama cares ... experience and it was just looking at a tweet from southern BS NBC one of these networks of what\nWould it look like what would America look like a with Medicare for all it would not even resemble the Republicans have knowing the end of the republic didn't believe on the line to check with is about all this Kimberley how are you\nHi I'm good how are you I'm very well thank you very much risking so Obama cares Medicaid expansion what are we looking at you because I mean we don't hear a lot about Obamacare these days\n[laughter] well I'm the Medicaid expansion part of Obamacare was intended to allow you know the Medicaid program which is funded by the state and federal governments to go to anyone making less than roughly you know Seventeen thousand dollars a year so low income people\nUm but because of the Supreme Court made that part of Obamacare optional states are now in the position of deciding whether they want to expand the program to low income people and their state or not and so there are four different states that are looking at doing this I'm In the on election day I'm In November\nSo what's things we talk among\nWhile we're looking at Idaho Nebraska and Utah and then Montana actually already expanded but the vote would make it permanent because their program is set to sunset and twenty Nineteen\nOkay so is this is this political in any way in the states I mean we have some special elections that are going on that people are doing this for abuse\nRight well any time that you're dealing with Obamacare it tends to be very political and states and obviously the states or um you know much more right leaning um but the Republican legislatures in each of these places have resisted Medicaid expansion um they say that it would be too expensive for the state because the state has to pay for a portion of it\nUm and so they have not pass any kind of expansion and that's why advocates uh you know who are in favor of out of Obamacare really has pushed for going through ballots instead so that they that they can kind of bypassed the state lawmaker so\nMisses Syria's this though when we're seeing the economy coming back and the jobs coming back and you know I got a kid who's just into the workforce and um you know he's he's going to be twenty six was going to get off our insurance and he's getting insurance through his own\nEmployer no and so how much is that going on and how much is that the levy the pressure of people having to get on Medicaid\nIt can certainly alleviate a good amount of pressure because if you make more money than you know that Seventeen thousand dollars a year threshold than you no longer qualify for Medicaid\nUm so it can certainly relieve the pressure on states but they're also in states that didn't expand that program they have really high on insurance rates and in states that have higher on insurance rates you also have worse health outcomes for the most part\nSo it's one way to kind of address some of that and also you know think about the fact that people might be so ill and frail with an illness\nAnd not be able to receive medical coverage was they had medical coverage maybe they could you know get the care that they need and then head back to the workforce so those who are proponents of the expansion would argue that all of these things and kind of works together\nOr well then let me ask you ... would this happen\nIn back many years ago when Tennessee got a waiver and we could do our own deal as far as meditating concern it became ten senior and what happened was you had some employers at hand people that were there were on their insurance\nBut when they qualified for the ten year then they just do 'em all the insurance and threw him on the government how much how likely is that going to happen in some states", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Phil Valentine Show", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "23"}
