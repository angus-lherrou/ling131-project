a while I'm always in the great mood but um you can tell you that\nIt's kind of sickening I come in with a song of the day I'm always humming or whistling a song and it drives me crazy was our ... our song of the day was a uh the royal risen song you got it made it has been you know that's not the first time either you have come in singing that song if they'll ever yes you why do I keep saying you are really stuck on that song well it's interesting because\nI had lunch when my kids today and uh we were having and he was humming that song and I said was that the traveling will berries or was that just wrong\nAnd it was just ... but it was the traveling ... because you know who wrote the song and playing on it Tom Petty and Jeff and Jeff Lynne yeah you can hear the jets land ... that's what I'm saying yeah sounds like I said it sounds like George Harrison but then\nJeff Lynne of course you know is is I mean he is he a low I mean there's you got electric light orchestra but it's Jeff Lynne I mean he always hired other people he did it you know he was the brains right on that\nAnd I always thought and I had a guy Blake if you're out there just remember them saying Blake lived in the apartment complex in the army and Charlotte um this is late seventies and he uh he was a fanatic of yellow\nAnd he always said this and I agreed with him he says he a low as ... the Beatles would've sounded\nLike if they'd stayed together that's interesting because when I obviously definitely is a huge beetles fan because I saw them live here probably in eighty two and they are going\nBack on the road wasn't Jeff Lynne and the yellow this was immigration very cool and but\nUh he did a tribute to John Lennon and the tracks he chose not that great is that you I mean not what you would think you'd hear live I I Am the walrus right but they were done so well I mean I was just blown away you know if it was awesome but he had a low I mean they\nIt does sound like the Beatles were so I'm sitting here thinking\nYou've got it is a song that I could have humming today and I said you know that sounds like George Harrison but it reason it sounds like George here says 'cause it's Jeff Lynne who always sounded like George yeah the ... the weird thing and then George Harrison and Bob Dylan get together\nI guess uh either right before that right after they do the traveling will berries and as soon as I said before that was the right before that yeah because that was I think one of the last tracks that Roy Arabs and cut yeah that was a great cells they came out after he died\nWhy do I keep hoping that some well because it's a good 'cause I remember when it came out it really stuck with it I thought that's a great song it's got a really good ... yeah it does it's very good why are we often that I have no idea that old\nAnd I was in country radio the time and I used to play that one along with Steve Earle even went on blue which both sounded so good together really they both had kind of ... their twelve cheering on our side yeah\nSo I Know why I was saying they came with a good move because I was humming you got it by Roy ... orbits and read them in a good mood they were more than usual is having watched the um the press conference where last person I was just watch the watch the um what would you call it\nGet together to get together with Donald Trump and Kanye West it in the oval office and as I've said I mean full disclosure I've never been a huge Kanye West and when you like him that 'cause it like Trump\nWell yeah [laughter] I mean when he saying things that I agree with\nWhy in the world would you want to disrupt that well if you vote for the Democrats that's exactly what they're going to do because they don't have any ideas of their own I Want you to take note of that to\nWhat is their idea their ideas the stop Donald Trump stopped Donald Trump from lord for making the country great again stop Donald Trump from record low black unemployment stopped Donald Trump from unemployment\nNot this low since Nineteen sixty to what is it about Donald Trump you want to stop with the tweeting well he's not going to stop tweeting just because you're taking control of Congress matter of fact these tweets probably gonna get worse\nSo what is it about Donald Trump that you want to stop\nWell you want to stop the prosperity because it's all about the power it's not about making the country great again or whatever that will tell you if I Know you find this hard to believe in and tell you the truth\nIf Obama during his time in in a in a in the White House had come up with some great ideas to make America great again I Would have gone okay we got to go with this guy but he didn't\nEverything he wanted to do was big government big government big government we have the slowest recovery in the history of the United states after the recession it wasn't that the recession was was Obama's fault\nIt was that he just exacerbated the misery with all of this recovery program and all of the other stuff that was a government solution to it\nWhen I knew and you know and most of the American people knew what we needed to do was to have a free market solution\nWell the pendulum usually swings when it's swings way to one side of usually swings back in the other direction equally and that's what I was Trump trimming Trump came alone\nIt matter of fact if we'd had Romney when we'd never have a Trump and we may be just sitting there sort of in a ... government free market solution and we may just still be muddling through\nBut because we got another dose of Obama it's still to this all the way to a relief free market solution now there's some things I disagree with the president on them as the ethanol thing and and I keep hearing from the ethanol folks and they're saying we put the ethanol and the gasoline to\nTo to make the air cleaner I ...

cap on sale at a guy who could play catch with is is\nIs that she didn't have that opportunity which was studying and then when he also said you know a lot of African Americans out there they don't like again they don't like make America great again and the reason being if you are anything but a white now historically life wasn't better for you\nThan it is and the current will make its Donny LA is that just took place and even the president will say\nThis was just supposed to be a lunch that's an outright lie I Hope to the White House myself several days ago\nAnd I said I like that you know unpredictable ... and I guess what so are we there was absolutely a press\nRelease that went down the way you would think actually a meeting between the president Kanye West Jim rallies or by the way Kanye West said or blacks really like you get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry his comment to a white police brutality is to release the love\nAnd he said that there should be in Chicago easy id Asian setters that's\nWhat it means by which is a the name thank God has a a ... that the law that sentiment is what gave him the balls or to go for it and make so much money do the gate as I'm just stunned across the board you\nKnow we're going to have a God I thought they were going to have a conversation which we would follow up on 'em in part on\nJustice reform sentencing and prisons which is by the way a bipartisan really important idea a there was that was mostly nonsense [noise] uh but there were some things in there that probably I was just yeah so they go so it wow\nThat was bonkers\nSo you heard what he was saying and there was more to there was even better than that\nBut it was bonkers according to the folks have BS NBC you know why 'cause bonkers things everything else is bonkers\nCrazy things everybody else's crazy these people are imploding as a movement and that's why you see the violent mobs out then yes it is these are mobs going nuts on folks confronting people in restaurants screaming at him\nAs we were saying yesterday with Don the lemon saying well that's your freedom of of an expert no it's not trespassing\nAs we told you yesterday\nOn somebody else's business and screaming and disrupting their business is not a constitutional right it's against\nThe law but\nPeople like ... and then some of these other folks believe that they have a constitutional right to confront people anywhere they want to confront him how long have I said to you about the kneeling that it's not a matter of protests as a matter of workplace you do not have a right to protest their work\nIf you think you'd do try and matter of fact tomorrow if you're working at a bank say you're a bank teller instead of being a bank teller why don't you just sit there and hold up a sign and said the man stinks or whatever or I'm taking a need for the bank or whatever\nAnd just and don't do your job and see how long you keep your job\nYou do not have a right to protest that work\nDo you have a right to on your own time stand on the street corner in front of the bank\nAnd air your grievances absolutely but that's on your own time on public land not on a bank's property you don't have a right to go on the banks property and disrupt their business you don't have a right to go in a restaurant and disrupt their business\nBut the left thinks this is freedom of speech this is why they're crazy man they rewrite all the rules to fit their insanity you're watching\nThe Democrat Party and float and the reason the Democrat Party is imploding is that because all Democrats are crazy it's because the crazies if taken over the party and you folks who are lot lifelong Democrats you're seeing this and you know it's true\nI've told you this before but some of you are new to the program my father was in Congress or twelve years and he was\nHe was what um Tip O'Neill referred to as a bowl we evil\nIn other words he was a southern Democrat voted with the Republicans a lot of the time now he got worse about [laughter] or better depending on your perspective he he got less and less inclined to voting with the Republicans the longer he was there\nI got a theory on why that happened but I'll tell you I remember going up in visiting him if he went in he was elected to maybe to win in the navy for him and he chose not to run in Ninety four and was out in Ninety five\nSo he's up there twelve years a self imposed term limit during the Nineteen eighties I remember going up there and visiting him\nAnd we saw Nancy Pelosi and I remember on one occasion we were getting on the elevator and Barney Frank was getting off\nAnd you know mounted and loved him and he said he burning and then we got on the elevator elevated closed and my father said that guy's crazy\nAnd I went yeah okay I have a ...\nAnd they said the same thing about Nancy Pelosi will flash forward to the two thousands and those folks are running\nThe Democrat Party in Washington DC so the craziest took over the foreign whacked out left wing of the Democratic party took over and there are a lot of people who are in the ... for the Democratic party my father was one he was a it was a Democrat in the day he died\nBut it wasn't the party of FDR and JFK and it was the party of\nNancy Pelosi and Barney Frank the people that he set himself are nuts\nBut a lot of people stick with things because of tradition don't be that foolish rocks\nI knew and the early Nineteen eighties when Ronald Reagan came along that there was something better than the than the Democratic party and that's what I jump ship and in it and it wasn't for anything other than I open my mind and I said\nWho is speaking to me in other words who do I agree with but not in my lawyer to this party or did I campaigned for this or that\nWho is speaking to me as a party and it was the Republicans now I don't always agree with Republicans on everything so I go with ideology\nWhich is conservatives and if you do that you can't go wrong because not all Republicans are conservative\nBut most conservatives Republicans summer libertarians but you go with your ideology well what's happened is a lot of you folks have been sticking in there with the Democrats because you still think of the Democratic party is JFK this ain't JFK's party\nThis ain't even chevies party anymore I mean they've they've gone to the left of teddy these people are on hinged\nAnd since Trump came along understand there are two things that you're dealing with when you're dealing with Trump as far as the left is concerned\nThere's a personality clash which I get that part I understand that he can rub people the wrong way he can he can be bombastic he can be tested going be narcissistic I get all that part about it\nBut that's not really why they're old so upset with them\nWhat they are but that's what they that's what they tell you that's what they point to they talk about you know he's a he's ... he's out of control either they point other what's really got I'm Upset is that Trump is actually doing\nWhat Republicans have threatened to do for decades and that is to cut taxes and cut taxes for real cut taxes for corporations\nDo something about the unbridled illegal immigration do something about the runaway regulations these are things that Republicans have paid lip service to for many years and they've just nibble that around the edges Donald Trump comes in there and starts I mean just kicking button taking names\nAnd that's what's got him so upset\nThe dirty secret on this is that what is really upsetting them as it they doing it and he's being successful at doing it\nAnd that's what's got them scared because they had a large\nSegment of society especially minorities bamboozled into believing\nThat if you didn't have the Democrats in some sort of control that you were going to be just wash decide in this society\nAnd now we have a record low unemployment for Hispanics and blacks and female unemployed women unemployment something like a sixty four year low it's unbelievable\n... it's unbelievable what this guy who hates women hates minorities that minorities and women are doing so well under this guy and the Democrats are scared to death\nSo when you see somebody like a Kanye West\nWho holds great sway not only in the black community ... with the millennials in the you know under thirty crowd there going oh my gosh we may be losing complete control if this catches on\nThat you actually don't need us 'cause I Want you to think about the difference in philosophy between\nThe Democrats and the Republicans\nThe Democrats are all about fear they're all about oh if the Republicans get into office\nThen you're not going to have anything\nNot yet they're going to take everything away while the Republicans run on a list of the free market decide this in other words we're not promising you anything we're not going to take care of you were going to take care of those who can't take care of themselves but all the rest of us we're going to get out there and we're going to compete\nCause it Salvation Army top listening

most amazing how many states do about the negative or travel we get paid positive lovely the vine universal were so the fly\nLatest are\nYou know the very little you can disagree with right unless you're a liberal because you don't want the prosperity because it means you're never going to be in power again then he said this\n... job to America because of that ad for it came at a high here but when we make everything that China and not in there ... there were cheating on our country\nAnd you know and then one more I Believe Luther\nIt's more important than anything that we bring jobs to America and how we provide transition with mental health\nUh you know\nSo you mentioned mental health one of the things you said about mental health was interesting thing he says he was diagnosed as bipolar\nAnd then he started looking around talking to some folks and went to another psychiatrist like I said really you've been misdiagnosed you're not bipolar what you are sleep deprived which is an interesting theory that my wife said um put forth just a few days ago\nThat this psychiatry said look your sleep deprivation is causing your symptoms of ... what would appear to be bipolar you get your sleep deprivation under control\nAnd you're not going to have the mental problems anymore and boy is is that not an insightful way of looking out some use psychiatry is rolling your eyes well this is impossible\nBut how many of you folks have been sleep deprived\nWhile I have before and and on purpose and I'll tell you this we did you were with us Johnny B when we did that marathon what are the forty eight hours and and I did forty eight hours straight was forty eight hours it was two days yes it was\nForty eight hours straight on the radio this music radio we play music and we did I mean we literally did not sleep for forty eight hours probably more than that because you know we came in that you know whenever we came in I Can't remember\nBut um I don't know I was ... it was at least forty eight hours straight so when you get into the second day of that\nYou start to sort of hallucinate you start you start thanks yeah you're starting to lose your marbles and um\nYou know I didn't sleep at all and I'm going this is I mean I don't know what we did it for charity or something like that uh and we were a lot younger than to what can you remind them if you if you've ever been without sleep it going it it'll drive you crazy and I know some you folks have they're going to be I Can't sleep now too\nAnd you're just not the same it's not just a matter of being grumpy it changes your whole mental attitude your mental outlook on things so it makes sense so he was saying that the day of course of\nLeft wing media the poo poo in them but the big thing that they poop poop them about as he says you know where I where this mega hat and I feel like Superman\nOh my gosh you're talking about something that's going to resonate\nResidents can you imagine\nAs we've told you with a poll from last leaders let us let her part of August for ... thirty six percent supporting the black community for Trump thirty six percent so what we're seeing now\nWith ... and that number and I'm not saying that numbers because the economy I think ... is a reflection of that ... part of that thirty six percent Kanye gets it as far as Trump's concern along with thirty six percent of black America\nBut once you see somebody like Kanye coming forward and being so adamant and I think today the profanity notwithstanding quite eloquence and said in his position on this then you're going to see some folks\nSaying well you know ... given his cover and then you can see more and more people come out and they can see it yes exactly right I mean\nThis is about prosperity this is not about keeping people down there is not hitting one group against the other the Democrats are famous with that class warfare a race war fear a straight against gains transgender is against everybody transgender is against the world um\nYou name it I mean they love to pit one group against the other these people against the end it's just the darn thing you've ever seen because normally day to day

there you got to understand that the most any presidential candidates ever gotten is about twelve percent of the black vote\nIf Trump is now up to thirty six percent and that translates to the Republicans in the midterms\nIt's a silent black wave and nobody sees this coming but your old uncle Phil and I'm just telling you\nAs I tried to tell you which I don't make predictions and I'm not making a prediction here but as I tried to give you some indications of what I thought was happening before the twenty sixteen election and\nSome people including in my own family thought that I'd

about the you know\nIn other words it was we want the first female president matter whether she's qualified or who she is or whether she's a crook or anything else we just want a female president which is stupid if you were to reverse those roles and say well I'm voting for Trump just 'cause he's a guy basically then you would be all these folks were ridiculed\nYou off television what'd you can do that if it's a woman I don't understand that that's because we never had a woman in the oval office well this is why you say because if you run as just eight candidates then we're going to have

true\nThere is no chance\nLiberal rock Obama's family is his ancestors on his father's side were slaves there's no chance whatsoever his father came from Kenya if they were slaves they would've been over here\nThere's a much better chance that his ancestors were slave owners or slave traders because that's what happened one tribe would conquer another sell them to the Dutch slave traders and then you know they bring them over here\nBut the interesting part is he doesn't have that heritage in his history and he doesn't really have the black experience he can talk\nAbout all you know and when I was a black man in Hawaii oh I bet that was horrible yeah and he's just like Selma wasn't it is when I was in Honolulu boy I'm telling ya yeah with the dogs in the water hoses\nSure his worst story is is that he says he remembers it so he says\nThat um that are white men would walk on the other side of the sidewalk when he saw him coming which I have a hard time believing that is true or they lock their car doors yeah when they saw him coming and going right sure anyway so they got all men is\nHe does like me to say I mean is it was skinny guy looks like he's carrying jump ropes and these arms

she left on the company computer which appear to contradict her grand jury testimony\nAccording to a source telling the post the writings indicate it was consensual friendly it's caused a split in the Manhattan District attorney's office\nSome believe the charges should be dropped and then there's a problem with the complaint Manhattan prosecutor's ultimately decided not to drop evidence from the
