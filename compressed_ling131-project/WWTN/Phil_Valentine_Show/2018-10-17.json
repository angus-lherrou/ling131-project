been murdered in Turkey by the Saudis secretary of state Mike Pompeo has talked with officials from turkey and Saudi Arabia and each of the\nFormulate what the appropriate response to this would be [noise]\nRelations Senator Ben Sasse hopes the administration is also listening to U.S intelligence\nI have lots of confidence in the U.S intelligence community and I think that they're they're building information that's very useful for the president to understand that I Hope you're listening to all that information and not just that the arguments that are coming from Saudi officials\nWhere bin Laden was left freebie whopper eight out to do with the blessing of the United states corrupt officials after waging jihad against the citizens\nAre there's a book out called pain how we dismantle the FBI and our pajamas and the details and documents the incredible American betrayal and what they're talking about in this is that um\nWe sort of turned a blind eye to a lot of stuff\nAnd we did not do what we needed to do to make sure that we were actually feeding these folks now if you remember we were giving aid and comfort to the mujahideen\nAnd that was Osama bin Laden and that's when they were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan and again the enemy of my enemy is my friend as the old Russian saying goes and then the Soviet Union was defeated in the enemy of my enemy\nTurns out to be my enemy to well that's where we are\nAnybody who believes that we should spread Islam around\nThe world to the point now and again if you're Muslim you're saying well why is this any different\nFrom Christians going around and proselytizing and sending missionaries abroad and the rest of it\nI have no problem if you want to share your religion with somebody and that they say hey this sounds like a great idea I Believe I'll tell somebody else I mean you know it's like an way\nSo [laughter] I mean you build your little pyramid or religious scheme and it starts to spread I'm no problem with that what I have a problem\nWith is saying uh at some point that well this is not happening fast enough so hey do you want to be a Muslim or you don't okay I'll kill you\nAnd then it becomes a problem because Christians don't go around killing people who don't agree with them but there are some Muslims who do not all obviously and it's a problem inside the quote unquote Muslim community well the question here is\nWhere was this cash Haji guy and the spectrum of\nIslam was\nHe a radical was he a moderate was he um more where was the\nIt seems to me that if he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood which is every indication that this guy was a spy for the Muslim Brotherhood or if in fact that was the case\nThen he's a radical Muslim I'm not saying that's reason enough for the Saudis to kill him and this member him I mean there's going to be an investigation into this and we're going to find out what it's not this cut and dried thing old journalist walks into an embassy and then you know\nComes out and several parts I mean it's it's it's not that simple\nBut the mainstream media folks are trying to portray this guy as some voice of freedom and he was the exact opposite if this guy got his way people would be under the rule of a theocracy\nAnd for the life of me I Can't understand how progressive liberal Democrats\nCozy up to all of this nonsense about we want to take over countries and make them theocracy isn't that school they don't like any kind of religion most of them aren't religious at all and most of these journalists will be the first ones that would be headed by these folks who take over these countries yet they continue\nTo defend them and they continue to a align themselves I don't understand this I don't understand it at all unless as\nIn the case of ... mall Kosh Haji\nIt's a way to get the Trump and I've told you this from the get go on this thing he's going to be the end game and I don't know that they've you may have seen this I don't watch a lot of BS NBC or CNN so they may already be saying this I haven't seen it but to me it's leading up to this you know Trump was talking about how the media\nAre the enemy of the state and this is what happens when he says that\nYou've got these regimes around the world but here that and they think well we can just kill\nJournalist at will so this is Trump's fault and don't think for a second that they're not trying to at least insinuate if not outright said that Trump is trying to hide something on behalf of the Saudi Government\nNow we've got palm pale who went over there and met with ah been salami and some other folks who was it yesterday and I heard a report on NPR and they\nSaid uh they said that uh Mike Pompeo walks\nInto the meeting smiling and he has nothing he should be smiling about I'm going well he's you know you ... what do you want them water and they're given the people to finger you know he walks in there he's\nHaving received a diplomat and he's going over there as you do and you got Obama who was over there bowing and kissing rings and whatever you can get his lip zone\nAnd nobody had a problem with that what I wasn't in the in the end and the wake of this a horrible feeling of this journalist he's not a journalist he's an opinion writer and he's also as far as we can tell a spy for the Muslim Brotherhood this could very well have been a situation where\nThey were luring this guy and so they could kill him\nIn other words execute him because he was a spy I don't know is that a good thing doesn't sound like it to me but\nIs it the worst thing that the Saudi Arabians I've ever done I don't think so but it's being blown up the for us to believe this from the same folks who didn't give a rat's rub the for folks died in the consulate in Benghazi\nWhere was the outrage about bad where was the demand that we got to the bottom of it and we hold people responsible while the people responsible for Hillary in Obama\nSo the mainstream media completely ignored that story even worse than that when the people who were screaming for attention on it they tried to deflect it and say oh come on conspiracy theorists and everything else so far people died in the ... the big one up\nAnd now we got some guy who's a Muslim Brotherhood spy who dies on the consulate in Turkey and we're supposed to care more about that than we cared about Benghazi\nI don't understand that at all unless you look at it through the prism of we're going to get Trump or we're going to blame it so that's come and give it as an order to come\nGoing to try to somehow twist is around so that his Trump's role\nIn the meantime San Fran man ladies and gentlemen she says that she's not willing to trade anything\nFor a border wall in other

can so there is no way around it what do you tell them and they'll just go around it well then we'll build a border wall where they were going around it man and he said today but then they go around

the way I was a feeling of the day now I\nYou know I I read a veer away from the the high price pumps of Britain would a and I'm going to stay on these folks\n'cause this is just if not right they well nobody can sing either paying anyway and I guess that's true I guess if people are filling up for fifty cents a gallon more than the can down the road and several people have told me\nOh Phil you're on the stand is because the high price of real estate well guess what happens when a Kroger moves in somewhere where the gas pumps and they lower the price they all lower their prices isn't that amazing\nHow are you I'm Glad I'm well thank you for taking my call sure what's on your mind that Thomas well\nI'm master air sea and dance level diagnostic certified in automotive and I can

that is\nUm I was part of a team that um we did not get handed the millions of dollars\nBecause our cars clutch kale in the acceleration which then three days later wait a minute we don't need a collector had electric motor and on our car to accelerate from zero to sixty in under five seconds and it's a thirty five hundred pound car\nWhile and it gets to a hundred and something to the gallon yeah well what's that going on what it wants to say okay what are you always say well in his late so what does that mean equivalent\nThirty five thousand watts of electricity equals a gallon of gas in color\nAnd uh so you what you're saying is but if you hand so let's say your own solar panels charging this thing up you wouldn't take anything off the grid and this thing would be charged up for free run\nThis thing takes three dollars to charge it up off of rural electric\nFrom like empty and then it goes two hundred and fifty miles 'cause we only have basically a a gallons worth of energy a in electric batteries that we have a in fact we use lithium iron phosphate batteries instead of the lithium ion ... kept causing one of our\nUm I'll just say that's why competitors to have their cars catching on fire and then that makes five degrees and we're about halfway to China where hardship takes twenty five hundred degrees to start that chemical reaction so guess what kind of batteries that

two octane or whatever is that is that really better for your automobile\nIt depends on your car ... king is resistance to bond or in other words that sponsor and we call it it's on him but it's really just to pass on so the bottom line is this if your car\nNeeds because of compression higher octane so that it doesn't start the explosion claimed that Charlotte before the spark plug does in other words when you need to use the higher opting otherwise\nIf you're using higher up again in a vehicle that doesn't mean it then what happens is is that their resistance to explosion takes place and you don't get all the energy out and it gets\nA converted into catalytic converter and you're not using the fuel anyway so you don't get any better performance out of it some kind of depends on if you got a performance engine or a lot of European geckos have higher impression so they need that so that it doesn't start explosion before the start of this\nInteresting varied Thomas look ... the wealth of information meant\nElectric car a range of two fifty\nThat's that's I mean that's see when we get to this thing where you can charge him up and no time like it takes you to to fill up a gallon I'm thinking five to seven minutes eight minutes ten minutes maybe\nA then we're there and at that point you know I mean I'm a big electric car fan um there's the the the range problem that

government of these folks they're going to have to get them out\nNow feel you're saying they go around and say anybody who doesn't like Trump needs to go well yeah basically that's what I'm saying I mean you can't operate in this situation where you are potentially going to be leaking things to the media you got to stop the leaks now you don't need somebody goes the Trump forever\nThat kind of stuff but you need to be going through and making sure that you don't have crazy activist that are in the government because let me tell you some folks\nThis has been their goal for a long time especially the companies and I hate to sound like you know Joe McCarthy to you but this has been their goal to get into education and to get into the to infiltrate the government and they've done a very good job of it\n\nWhat it is incumbent and see how many of these folks you say that there that are members of the Democratic socialist of America that is a communist organization well know feel that just socialist they called themselves\nAnd I I read this many years ago now this quote stuck with the what's the difference between a socialist anti communist the firing squad that's all I mean is there basically the same thing and when you've got folks who are members of the Democratic socialist of America\nOr I don't want to sound like Joe McCarthy again but I Would say that that probably disqualifies you've or working in our government this is not like it's a mainstream oh they're just Democrats know\nTheir comedies and they want to overthrow the government's they've said so it's in their literature the whole thing\nThey want to get rid of capitalism\nAnd capitalist\nAnd so these are the types of false what do you want to bet this ... Mayflower salaries Edwards with a name like that as a member of the Democratic socialist\nOf America as a matter of fact they don't think so and do they think so and it's ... ... what see were just finding this out today\nOr somebody is bound to run some kind of check on this I'm going to do a quick a quick check on this chick hold on just a second they won't take but because we are going to\nSue the magic of the Internet and I'm going to put that an old quote so that it stays together the mole crab cake socialists of America let's see if we getting hit here [noise]\nUh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah the Washington Times report and does that say that she's a member of it\nRight man and then ... on a socialist\nAnd say that I I'm just going to say I'll bet a dollar to build up this woman is a member of that group this what we're finding all the time these folks that are what was that um what was the name of that crazy ... down there and she was a contractor and she was leaking stuff to the intercept you remember her name she had a real strange name\nUm you know I'm Talking about the rain man\nI guarantee she's a member of these organizations it's like where and how many of these people have to pop up on your radar before you figure out oh my gosh we may have a problem with the Democratic socialist of America\nThere infiltrating the government in sabotaging this is what they do so I Would go through and find that do if an FBI background check if you got any affiliation with this organization you fired and we're going to get real Americans in there for crying out loud\nCome on man [noise]\nI Know I Know I Know exactly what's on the oh gosh it sounds like McCarthyism well let me tell you something if you go back and read about the McCarthy he was about Ninety percent right now maybe got an overzealous on some folks\nBut some of the people he was going after we didn't find out for decades that these people were all inside the government or like a Hollywood now yeah and they were all lead up with them they were\nRighteously indignant on my gosh this is a witch hunt\nWe just found some which is just what we still do and they're all in there and they all have look I'm not saying that you can't be a member of the Democratic socialist of America what I'm saying is is we don't need that this this should be a security flag\nIf you're a member of an organization that wants to destroy capitalism you don't need to be in the government apparatus of a capitalist nation will feel who says we have to be capitalist because capitalism in America are joined today have how many times I got to tell you this well this is one of the old ... from uncle Phil\nCapitalism in America are joined at the hip if you're anti capitalist you are by definition anti American you can say oh I Love this country if it Rowley socialist then it wouldn't be this country any more\nIf you think that this will be a wonderful utopia if we would just be a socialist country then you don't care about the United states of America because capitalism is what we are one built us\nAnd it's what we are through in throw you can't separate the two and then say oh well how about if we was the socialist\nStates of America no that wouldn't work communist states of America no they didn't know where the United states of America and were based on a capitalist system in the economy that's capitalist based not socialist capitalist\nIt's the best it's not perfect it is not perfect oh by the way you know I've been telling you over and over and over again\nHow this is a great time for entrepreneur is have you heard uncle Phil tell you this okay we'll check this out us and all this is it a show ... by the way feel Valentine dot com show prep\nThe U.S economy is now sitting back on top of the world Economic Forum annual global competitiveness the competitiveness survey for the first time since the financial crisis\nAnd you know they say about us well this is interesting because they say that the the new Nineteen states of America is uh the the reason they give us this this tops\nBut the reason we're on top is because of our entrepreneurial atmosphere\nThis is what they say that we beat out\nSingapore Germany Switzerland in Japan and other top foreign markets where the score of eighty five point six out of a hundred due to our vibrant entrepreneurial culture and strong labor market and financial system\nIs not there's never been a better time to be an entrepreneur if you've got an idea for something go forward this is the time what are you waiting on\nBut I'm scared but I understand that and I'm not encouraging you to take your life savings and go blow it on the next big thing but what I'm telling you is if you've ever had the hankering to be an entrepreneur launch company or launch an idea or whatever\nBeing prudent about it be smart about it but do it don't sit on them any longer this is the\nTime to take that idea and take the market or at least try to because there has never been a better time now I'll tell you this\nI think that that opportunity only gets better but I'm Talking about now looking backwards I Can't remember in my lifetime a better time to be an entrepreneur\nAnd the reason I say that even during the eighties as hot as the eighties where we didn't have the Internet\nAnd we didn't have social media and we didn't have apps and all of this stuff that just adds gasoline to an idea you put something out there that it's hot and everybody knows about it in ten minutes thinking about that it wasn't that way before\nWe had three networks and then we had cable with CNN and that was it now we've got all of this on TV we get you to we got the Internet\nIs just the chance that if you come up with the smoking hot idea\nThat it literally takes off overnight is so much greater now but it's ever been in the history of the United states really the history of the world the chance to take your idea and make it viral has never been better so if you've got a great idea now's the time to do it\nBecause he is something else to how many times have you said something or done something or whatever

referring to is bellwether congressional districts running and so they tell me to look at these and so I started looking at him and this was several weeks ago then it went back and looked at him you know earlier this week there is a district Minnesota a dental you've paid attention this when it was plus one plus two Democrats\nA about a month ago now it's plus sixteen the Republican and that's after the Kavanaugh thing and now all of a sudden they don't want us to look at that district is no longer rebel whether they want to look at everything else what do you see I Know well you know neither one of his his into production business but how do you think this is shaping up here three years or three weeks down the road\nWell I think that I'm having a fan if you can call it that was so\nI'm pivotal because it has United the Republican Party as never before a and the reason for that is that even the Republican court uneasy about Trump and thought that the left his stereo still with us from bad behavior or Trump shady pack\nOr Trump's this or that they may we live with Kavanaugh we have a complete Boy Scout not somebody who is\nNot only someone who has intellectually impeccable credential but somebody was certified by everybody I Know I'm I work with him and be morally upright either\nGentlemen and so on but you have here are kind of McCain Romney character of of knowing rectitude and the left was willing to destroy that guy without even go out and took or operation so that feeling that this could happen to any of us\nI think has sent a chill down the spine of Republicans were very alive we'd better move into action here this is very serious\nAnd what happened was in my estimation the Democrats underestimated are not only Trump but Kavanaugh they thought that they were going to spring this on the eve of the confirmation vote in the cabinet was just going to say okay this is too much for me I'm Out he didn't he stood in the fall\nAnd then they had to bring somebody up with the accusations and the so called witnesses and then we had to go through all of this\nThey never and then to me and this is where I was seeing him for Jeff Flake I thought we needed that FBI investigation not because you and I knew anything different afterwards but the American people saw that as a stamp of approval the good housekeeping seal of approval\nOn what the Judiciary Committee already knew so once we got the FBI's stamp of approval on the fact that uh this forward and woman had one of the witnesses she had were not lining up with what she was saying I think the whole thing changed that point\nI I agree with that uh I also think that what's happening is that Trump has this unusual ability not only to drive the other side nah I mean look at poor

Republicans lose the house in November Trump says he believes he is helping Republican candidates\nAs he campaigns end of the crucial midterm elections next month with Republicans facing hid wins Trump says he thinks the GOP is quote quote going to do well arguing that it feels to me very much like twenty six team of his efforts on the campaign trail Trump says I don't believe anybody ever said or anywhere anybody ever had this kind of impact\nHe resisted comparisons to Brock Obama took responsibility for the Democrats defeat in ... that was part of your show legs\nBut there's nowhere Hindu but he says that it won't be my fault\nSo he never said that is\nIt doesn't matter whether these for where these folks with whom asserts\nYou know 'cause if you do or he won't take blame you do search for blame and you don't find that he said he wouldn't accept the blame but then when they called him he doesn't say that either\nNo I think I'm helping people I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that is what he said he didn't saying I'm not going to be my fault but that's the headline\nEverywhere this is the a team had like Trump tells he ... he won't accept blame of GOP loses house\nHe never said that\nAnd you wonder why cause you fake news in a wide ranging interview three weeks before the election Donald Trump told the Associated Press he senses voter enthusiasm rivaling twenty six team and he expressed\nCautious optimism that his most loyal supporters will vote even when he is not on the ballot he dismissed suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor did\nFor midterm losses review the outcome as a referendum on his presidency ah no I think I'm helping people Trump says well that's not saying that he's not going to take care\n\nOf so I guess they're asking do you think you're hurting people no I think I'm helping people Trump says he won't accept blamed both the house loses if a GOP loses a nothing even close to it\nWell this is why we have\nMedia bias or the new study but speaking of that\nOn the issue of political bias on campus founded wild them much reported left wing bias among professors is certainly agree just it pales in comparison to the overwhelming political bias among those who most directly impact students' life\nSchool administrators\nIn a report published by the New York times American Enterprise Institute scholars Samuel Abrams is a self described conservative leaning professor\nPresent the findings of his study of the political leanings of around nine hundred students facing administrators or those who work concerns the quality and character of students experience on campus\nThe results were truly astonishing he says\nI found that liberal staff members out number they're conservative counterparts by the astonishing ratio of twelve to one only six percent of campus administrators identified as conservative to some degree while Seventy one percent classify themselves as liberal or very liberal\nFrom them and they have infiltrated everything\nHe says there's no one there's so much for the non academic programming on college campuses is politically one sided\nHe found the most severe liberal or conservative industry the ratio among schools in New England which is twenty five to one while the west coast has sixteen to one by us and the great lakes tend to one\nThe closest the balanced ratio he had been a fight is in the south west which still has to liberal administrators through every self described because\nHe knows the severity of the buyers ranges from two thirds by average in public and Christian schools to three fourths them private secular schools where the biases always overwhelmingly left wing so it doesn't even matter if you send your kid to a so called Christian school\nOr it's going to be biased on the left\nWell considerable focus has been placed in recent decades on the impact of the I Would love to go back to the college professors he says when it comes to collegiate life living in dorms and things like this the ever growing ranks of the administrators have the biggest influence on students on campus life across the country\nSo there is

to the media she gave him the bugs feet now she says and her name is Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards yes senior level Finn San employee\nAnd if you want to know what's been seeing is this is the financial crimes enforcement network inside the Treasury Department so she's you know\nThis is what they do is they enforce crimes you know as you go after criminals financial crimes and she's one of the senior officials here she was a stealing SARS and what SARS is these are suspicious activity reports\nAnd she was putting on a flash drive and she was giving them the bug speed but here's the coup

them\nOr I thought they were just go look at them\nPeter Green spawn is representing Edwards full name of course as we told you leaders Zuma Napoli Mayflower sours Edwards\nAnd um she's going to appear the United states district court for the eastern district or was scheduled this afternoon ... she's already been\nThe arrest was a result of the joint investigation between several law

been released on a hundred thousand dollar bond expected to appear before a judge\nOn November ... seconds and the southern district of New York\nShe's barred from speaking with reporters or offend send officials which seems reasonable considering the charges against or they say for big league politics\nIn the meantime we have a senior FBI official now this is where we have a problem it's an unnamed SEIU official the FBI improperly accepted tickets to a pro sports events from a reporter and then later lied to investigators when they confronted him about it\nThe FBI official who resigned from the agency during the pro initially told the inspector general's office under oath\nThere'll be official had paid for the tickets were later admitted that wasn't so the reporter who gave the tickets to the FBI official is a television news correspondent who covers the Justice Department in the FBI the report did not named corresponded the officials conduct violated federal regulations\nThe FBI declined to comment on the report's findings now my question about this is obviously they're bribing an FBI agent trying to get information does a reporter not hold some responsibility for bribing an FBI agent to get some information or we just go to the same thing with buzz speed\nThis woman that address Treasury Department handed this over to buzzfeed she's probably going to go to jail she's in the heat big trouble got that from Elizabeth Warren and or whoever it buzz feed got the information is no big trouble how can that be I don't want this thing and\nThat's

disappeared on October second they might provide a direct link between what happened and prince Mohammed\nThat went under cut any suggestion that Mr ... died in a rogue operation an sanctioned by the

around the world they killed journalist\nWhy is it well I I Know I I started asked the question already know the answer\nI was going to say why is it\nThat these so called journalists at the Washington Post New York times rescue folks who are being into CNN or not the least bit curious that the cash heart Haji may have been a Muslim Brotherhood spy\nAnd that may have been why the Saudis killed him I'm not saying that justifies it it would add to the intrigue actually it certainly is not justified just because the guy happens to oppose your regime that you're going to lure them into the conflict and kill him\nI was talking to a friend of mine today who's from turkey and I I you know I was asked him about because he pays a lot more attention to this stuff and I do\nAnd he was talking about how this was a situation where you are 'cause I'm going you know how does this happen you've got these hit me and apparently there were there the consulate the very same day that ... was there\nAnd he says is understanding is Akash Haji was wanting to go he was getting married or something and they are the ones who made the appointment for him he wanted to go to a different consul and the different country they said no meat is in Turkey and meet isn't the conflict on this day and this time\nThis person also told me that the Turks that were working there and you know the locals at work there were given the\nDay off yeah\nSounds rather suspicious on the part of the Saudis I don't think there's any doubt that they had this guy rubbed out the question is playing\nAnd if you find that he is a Muslim Brotherhood spy it explains why it does it make it rights but they're all looking at this like all Saudi Arabia is killing journalist\nI don't even have anything to do with the I being a journalist for the question is what are we going to do about it what should we do about it I've seen the Saudis do a whole lot\nThan this and we've not done a thing about it\nI mean we've never really probed in the nine eleven and why there were so many Saudis on those planes and whether they had connections to the Saudi Government which some websites in some investigative journalist have said that they do I'm not prepared to sit here and tell you that all that is true but it's certainly it is worthy of\nFurther investigation but they you know no they're not interested in that I

about the DVD also the midterms antifa mob rule socialism the whole thing the next welcome back how are you\nA hey I'm doing great are looking forward to being on the show\nWell good glad to have you so let's talk about we'll get to the DVD the moment the midterms you know what I'm seeing out there I got I got this uh well you look at a ballot ... votes they have these well they were caught referring to was bellwether\nCongressional district run and so they tell me to look at these and so I started looking at him and this was several weeks ago then it went back and looked at him you know earlier this week there is a district Minnesota eight you paid attention this when it was plus one plus two Democrats\nA about a month ago now it's plus sixteen the Republican and that's after the Kavanaugh thing and now all of a sudden they don't want us to look at that district is no longer rebel whether they want to look at everything else what do you see I Know well you know neither one of his his into production business but\nHow do you think this is shaping up your three uh three weeks down the road\nWell I think that I'm having a ... if you can call it that was so\nI'm pivotal because\nIt has United the Republican Party as never before a and the reason for that is that even the Republicans were uneasy about Trump and thought that the left his stereo ... deal with the Trump bad behavior or Trump shady pact\nOr from this or that if that maybe we live with Kavanaugh we have a complete Boy Scout not somebody who is\nNot only someone who has intellectually impeccable credential but somebody who was certified by everybody knew him and worked with him be morally upright either gentlemen and so on but you have here are kind of McCain Romney character of of of known rectitude\nA and the left was willing to destroy that guy without a single out of core operation for the feeling that this could happen to any of us I think has sent a chill down the spine of Republicans were very alive we'd better moving to action here this is very serious\nAnd what happened was in my estimation the Democrats underestimated\nAnd not only Trump's cabinet they thought they were going to spring this on the eve of the confirmation vote in the cabinet was just going to say okay this is too much for me I'm Out he didn't he stood informed and then they had to bring somebody up with the accusations and the so called witnesses and then we had to go through all of this\nThey never and then to me and this was where I was seeing him for Jeff Flake I thought we needed that FBI investigation not because you and I knew anything different afterwards but the American people saw that as a stamp of approval to good housekeeping seal of approval\nOn what the Judiciary Committee already knew so once we got the FBI's stamp of approval on the fact that this forward and woman had one of the witnesses she had were not lining up with what she was saying I think the whole thing changed that point\nI I agree with that uh I also think that what's happening is that Trump has the unusual ability not only to drive the other side nah I mean look at poor Elizabeth Warren I mean she
