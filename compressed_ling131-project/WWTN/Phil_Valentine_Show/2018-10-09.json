she's not going to run for president in twenty twenty resigning United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley a former South Carolina Governor simply says it's time to move on\nThis is going to be plenty of speculation about one of the news came out now even is Nikki Haley is willing to write out the ear at her un post she would be feeling pressure for national security adviser John Bolton who is decidedly anti United Nations for Haley the international flights may have taken a toll\nLet's see if they did in this story this up to\n... ha ha ha\n[laughter] ... district said the baby the instructor that'd be alliance education center whom I did not name and voluntarily resigned from a position with the district so they're not no they're not going to name her name her name her name is Samantha mess why in the world when the ... name\nShe's in the middle of all this controversy\nYou see your tweet on there we know who she is a Samantha she's probably listening of they will get

protect this little snowflakes you know gay she wants another gig somewhere teaching kids just don't give her an English\n... anyway Ninety two percent of the news coverage against Trump is negative I Know that as a surprise you but it is true this is another study for news busters\nAnd for weeks Americans go to the polls for the midterm elections the news media casting as a referendum on the Trump presidency\nNow of course if the Republicans when it's not going to be a referendum it's gonna be a lark it's gonna be an anomaly it's going to be something other than a referendum on\nTrump but if they do\nIf the Democrats when they take over the house and or the Senate then it's going to be a referendum on Trump this works\nOver the summer the broadcast networks have continued to pound Donald Trump and his team are the most hostile coverage of president TV news history Ninety two percent negative just eight percent positive and I look at all of the positive stuff that's going on\nUnemployment hasn't been this low since Nineteen sixty nine black unemployment at an all time low Hispanic unemployment an all time low Asian unemployment at an all time low consumer confidence at an all time high matter of fact we've got some one of those in\nUh oh I had another another\nOne of those stories and I'm probably I got a male pattern blindness I'm probably looking right at it on show prep but it's another one of those deals where you know the people are just absolutely thrilled with what's going on with the economy and [laughter]\nThey don't want to report it in the news oh by the way did you say Robert Redford feels out of place in America how's this guy for you on a place in Hollywood for crying out loud but I you know if Robert Redford as leftist as he is feels out of\nPlace in America we are doing something right we've actually taken America bag because we've gotten to a point where Robert Redford\nFields and ... then this is probably a darn good place to live I'll tell you that and if he's feeling uncomfortable in Hollywood something's going on something is going on anyway back to this deal of the negative press out there for this report\nA media Research Center analysts reviewed all one thousand in seven\nEvening news stories that's about Nineteen hundred minutes time about the Trump Administration on ABC CBS and NBC this was three in June first and September thirtieth telling the coverage for each topic\nAnd all it value to comments made by the anchors the reporters and nonpartisan sources such as voters are experts\nThe results showed that over the past four months nearly two thirds of evening news coverage of the Trump presidency has been focused on just five main topics\nThe Russia investigation immigration policy the cabinet nomination North Korea and us relations with Russia how about all of the economy news huh best economy like ever that\nPeople can remember it but no we don't want to talk about then no no no we don't want to talk about that at all because well that's not what people want to hear they want to hear all this negative stuff\nWell really they don't they I'm at and and that the positive stuff is cutting through I don't know whether you've noticed this or not but it is\nPeople are feeling good about the economy and this is something that is really confounding the left out there because they're going over him gee the economy's doing too well we've got to put a button there so you get comments from CNBC all we've got a the economy is hot spots but this could that could be\nDangerous ahead that could be dangerous it's too good it's too hot it's too hot too hot lady Taylor Swift get out\nThe vote Bush is a fairly working voter registration among young Americans shot up in the wake of the pop mega star and her ... her one hundred and twelve million Instagram followers to get out the vote vote dot org ... says nearly sixty five thousand Americans ages\nEighteen to twenty nine registered to vote in roughly twenty four hours after\nShe made the rallying cry by noon today that number grew to more than a hundred and two thousand well they're probably counting my kids too and I don't know how they're going to vote for if they're going to vote but\nI actually saw this 'cause I'm among the Democrats email list\nBecause I mentioned this is my kids I had one of them that was registered to vote and then the other two words and so I said something over the weekend when they were all home and I said you guys need to get registered to vote and one of my kids says all the deadlines are the best\nAnd so I'm sitting there doing chauffeur up this morning and this comes across the transom I have um somebody from the Democrat Party sent me an email or this is the last thing to register to vote in Tennessee and it's the last thing a lot of states that they use check your individual state wherever you are\nI just do a Google\nSearch you know registered to vote in whatever state you're in Florida California whatever and it'll show you how you can register to vote you can do it on line in most places so my kids I said look this is the last eight of vote I'm going to register to vote\nDo you want to I don't watch it yeah I'm not going to force you to do anything you don't want to do what do you want to register to vote sure I said well here's the Web sites you go to go on line you know you've got to put your Social Security number and stuff like that and then they'll get you registered to vote for both of them did it the other two so I got all my kids registered to vote\nNow are they gonna votes\nIn November I have no idea are they going to vote as I Want them to vote I don't know I'm not going to ask them see that's the thing you know one of my kids I was he was rhyme and me last night and he says you know what I what I've always appreciate about you is you don't tell us what to think you just want us to think\nAnd I said that sort of tells you know challenge everything is what I've always told you I don't care what kind of conclusion you come to was the longest is one that's of logic and common sense if it's some emotional reaction is something you have no idea what you're talking about\nThen I'm then I'm going to call you on it but if you thought it through and you come to a conclusion this different from me and that's fine I just want you to think about stuff that's all I'm not telling you how to do things I mean you're your own person you're oh man so\nIf they come to a conclusion to vote for somebody else in November and I just registered a bunch of comedy lives\nThen that's the way it is but you know [laughter] oh I'll let them do that but Taylor Swift is out there urging all these people and now we have a hundred and nine thousand two hundred and two thousand people have registered to vote well the question is is\nAre these people going to vote now here's the thing with the\nI guess you'd call it the millennial but it's really a

you start thinking about well\nYou know what harm can come who knows\nIf they get a passport I was looking at my passport the day I was putting it back away after the trip but I I lifted in my coat pocket and so I was thinking might go to the claim as there was my passport usually put it in the safe you know keep it safe and it has you know him for Mayo but what if I go with just acts\nI don't know that that hurts anything it's just stupid I mean they they put you on a you know your your identity on a passport so that if something\nHappens to you or if you happened to go rogue and then they know who they're looking for\nA attention attention all cars attention all cars were on the lookout for\nA white X or y acts I repeat of white acts if you see a white acts plays due to attain this I\nMean how you're supposed to tell the folks were well I guess you know you could dressed as a woman if you're a guy anyway and get around that too with the beard may give you a way but hey if we're on the lookout for a white X then we're going to be profiling when we pull over people with acts on their driver's license that's going to be profiling that we can't do that\nIt's just [noise]\nI think you'll agree with me if you've gotten a sense of the this is just stupid but see here's the thing with these ah left these\nThey run out of legitimate causes and so they're not having to make it up\nYou know we've got Rosa Parks on the bus Martin Luther king and the speech and I have a dream and all this stuff and we really run out of legitimate things to fix in this country so now we're gonna have to make it so you can put anything on your driver's license or it's set for a male or or woman\nIt's really strange isn't it by the way someone you know I was telling you the other day I said you think that these liberals\nAre going to calm down at some point and I'm telling you they're not it's only going to get worse\nAnd so somebody on Twitter said that says I heard you talking

of everything in the streets I'm Talking about people going nuts running you over\nIt's just a it's it's violence it it's like you see in this uh these dystopia or movies and things like this it's when everything's society completely breaks down because what these people I have a newspaper column about this several months ago\nThese people what they want is they don't like American society we got the Robert Redford story I'll share that with you in a moment they don't like American society so what they want to do is they want to burn the country down\nIt's not like they want it they want to be able to put an ex by your name and set of male or female they\nWant all sorts of crazy things and they don't like this country and they don't always get their way and when they don't get their way they feel like it's just um it's not worth even having a country like this so we're going to burn it down so this is the ultimate\nPeak liberal is where these folks have just completely destroyed

D. to seven nine six four or five\nHad yours in vale Nashville\nStudio where dogs I mean I [noise]\nThat is considered a considering implementing ... cargo the problem is it's been tried before and the results\nWere not pretty the best evidence about the potential effects of these programs comes from the federal government's negative income tax experiment that experiment that ran from Nineteen sixty eight to Nineteen eighty eight consisted of\nFor random controlled trials\nAcross six states designed to test the negative income tax similar to the universe will be getting come to negative income tax guarantee they minimum income which phases out as earnings increase matter of fact\nMurray Charles Murray ah in his Nineteen eighty four book losing ground himself\nDescribed the negative income tax experiment as quote the most ambitious social science experiment in history\nNo other even comes close to its combination of size expense links and detail of analysis\nAnd as he recounted the experiments planners that providing a minimum income would encourage work but their worst fears were realized when the results show the opposite\nEvaluations of the experiment found that the negative income tax reduced quote desired hours of work by nine percent for husbands twenty percent for wives and twenty five percent for single female heads of family\nFor single males who were not heads of households throughout the experiment the reduction in work hours per week was forty three percent\nIf recipients lost their jobs during the experiment\nThey experience significantly longer spells of unemployment compared with non recipients more than two months longer for husbands almost a year longer for wives and longer still for single mothers for every thousand dollars in additional benefits there was an average reduction of six hundred and sixty dollars in earn income\nThat meant that three thousand dollars in government benefits required to increase the net income by a thousand so we're spending three times as much to actually get the the results\nStudies also made it clear that the a receipt of unconditional eight not phased out of benefits which led to reduce workers' effort and losing ground Murray concluded that the effect of the negative income tax on reducing ... was unambiguous in strong to his credit\nHe's acknowledged that such disastrous results should be expected of guaranteed income as an adult into rather than a wholesale replacement of the existing system of welfare and social insurance\nIn fact he asserts and losing ground that the truth negative effects\nIn the negative income tax experimenter understated because those effects were over and above the effect of the work disincentives in the existing system but see what's happening with the universal basic income\nIs you really don't have to work you just get a basic income now how many people are going to try and live off that and then scam as they do on other things to hide in the other income that's coming in\nThis we've already seen this with welfare so you can imagine if we give you a living Wayne you're just for breathing that we're going to give you a disincentive to work\nAgain I go back\nTo raising children of course I'm no expert on obviously those are those those are you know me and my family my kids know this but so I'm not claiming that I've got the\nAll the answers all I Know is this and with my kids and we've we've told them you know you got to get to do this we push 'em we push 'em and we put the email him back and forth with a gentleman that kids are kids who went to school with my kids and he was talking about what his kids were up to announce them\nAnd I said it's interesting to you know when you push 'em out of the nest to see them fly or sometimes they flap around a little bit before they fly but eventually they're going to fly but they're never going to fly if you clip their wings and bring them home and put them in a cage\nAnd is that the most humane thing it's like putting the four hundred pound guy on a donkey you don't do it if not humane\nSo what we should be doing is trading our fellow citizens as we would treat the ones we love our own family and that is to say hey I Love you but you need to get out and make it on your own\nAnd if you make it on your own you're going to be happier with yourself\nTo give you some sort of a universal basic income no matter whether you're working or not is not a long term solution and I'm not saying we don't do this for people who are first starting out we've all had kids and\nYou know they need this that or the other and maybe mom dad can you help me with this until I you know really get my feet out or you know my feet under me\nBut I'll tell you with me and even then you know you you wonder whether you're doing the right\nThing I Know with me when I decided I was out on my own I was out of my own uh my father had the means but he didn't have the he didn't he didn't have the intention to give me any money matter of fact my um\nMy wife and I were talking about this one of the best things for both of us now her situation was she really didn't have the means now they were poor or anything but her parents were school teachers you know my father was a lawyer so he had the means giving anything and just wouldn't give it to me and I knew this 'cause I asked [laughter]\nAnd uh you know I've told you the the story about the sport because matter of fact I told him that on his deathbed\nAnd I said you know I just want you know before you go\nOf a you know I've told a lot of stories on some good some of them not but I I have told that sport coat story a thousand times on the radio and it's one of those things that left a lasting impression because I thought for the longest time you're above the whole\nUh but you were actually doing what was right for me I'll give you the\nThe abridged version of this I had been working in radio got blown out in the format change and so I lost my job and I went to work for an ad agency selling jingles of all things and as my father committed to my brother one time\nUh after I got this gay or any cleaned up clean it up but he didn't he says I'm a film couldn't sell sex on the true dream so um [noise] uh he he knew me and he knew me better about that than I did I'm not a salesman\nLong story short if it's I'm not too late for that I um went to work for this hadn't seen as strict commission\nAnd uh so I came to him when I first got this gig and I said I Need to buy five sport coats and it was going to be five hundred dollars a hundred dollars just for code I said I Need a different sport over every day so I can go and make the sales goals and he says I'll be glad to co signed at the bank for you\nAnd I said are you kidding me\nHe said no I'm not kidding you I'll be glad to grow then goes on and I got hacked off at him I said you know you can't give me five hundred bucks go buy some ...

I mean that we're here we're we're hearing now all all the spike in the ball they're celebrating in the locker room after the cabin all thing and then Trump of course when he was ... he does the\nCeremonial swearing in any apologizes cabin on his family's saying I'm Sorry you had to go through all this so Anderson Cooper is asking governor John Case sick of Ohio about this\nA governor the language that the president is using calling Democrats a mob saying the whole thing was a hoax brought up by people who are evil in his words are those are the words you use to describe what happens here\nWell you know of course I wouldn't ... look at a time has come\nTo move beyond this and name calling or you know kind of celebrating in the locker room you know that's that's not the way to move forward in fact when you when that's when you should really go out of your way to figure out how to hand something to those who have lost and\nNot try to put it in their face you just didn't arrange them in constantly divide ... when I was in Congress I used to work with Democrats are a number of things including balancing the federal budget you know and\nLimiting the production of the beach too we did this together Republicans and Democrats we felt good about getting things done\nWhen I became governor I tried to shove through a labor reform\nWithout and like are a lot of us involved in this and we showed that through without really talking to organized labor they turned around they put something on ... they put something on the ballot they reverse my decision and handed me my lunch\nAnd you know I'm Glad it happened early in my term because I learned something you know I I'm strong opinionated I I Believe strongly in in the things I Want to do\nBut I've learned that it is better to work with others so they can have something and we can add something\nThat's the way in which you unify and we are losing that because we are operating in a zero sum game world and what does that mean flip a coin I win and you lose and you know what it's my job to vanquish my opponent\nThis is very dangerous for the long term of our country Anderson\nAttention when you say no one came away from this confirmation battle failing because even though it's one you know I certainly judge Kavanaugh feels like his reputation has been has been selling and tarnished and I mean is there a better way to do this moving forward\nSo I Would think in regard to the court what a president I think should do is to you know for example with the president with Trump now ... or if I were there I tell you what I Would try to do I would say we're going to have a conservative justice\nAnd I called mansion and you know my friend from the ... over there in Delaware and Tom Carper and maybe a couple of other people that say look we're going to have a conservative\nCan you can you work with me to make sure we pick somebody we can have some unity going forward after I lost that union business we've been able to do a lot of things together we were able to get our and I can't learn that guy\nI'm like I Can't listen anymore\nSo you're supposed to go to the Democrats which has been taken over by the crazy folks on the crazy dream and you're supposed to say can we get somebody that you would like what are we supposed to do with al ... let Dr Ford text in when she wants him to change his opinion on something\nThis is the most in saying they're going to the Victor goes the spoils\nI'm not saying that you have to rub it in people's faces but I don't think by Donald Trump apologizing the Kavanaugh for what all he was put through by Spartacus and the rest of these idiots out there is spiking the bowl we got cabin on the air because we got Trump in the presidency\nAnd Trump's not supposed to go to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and say hey what do you think of this guy or what do you think of this scale no that's not how it works\nYeah the reason that the reason to come here because this is America and you can make it on your own if you if you come here and people say well these illegal immigrants work hard I think some of them do a lot of them do\nSome of them are criminals some of 'em or you know good and MS Thirteen gang members some of them are that's the whole point of not coming through the gate and weeding out the bad apples\nUh but yeah if they if they're coming here because they want to be in the land of opportunity this should not be the land of dependency but what happens\nIs of course is the path of least resistance you get here and people say well you can sign up and the government will give you this that or the other\nWhether they'd be foolish not to qualify for when they when they get here and they say well what I'm going to do is I'm going to supplement my income by doing this before they know they're stuck on the government dependency\nBut back to John Case it boils down to the one thing John Casey ran for president and got beat so I mean you had your chance\nYour ideas didn't win Trump's did and you're still soar about it at least Lindsey Graham can be man enough to move on and say look I don't always agree with the president I don't always agree with his tactics\nBut he's right on a lot of stuff but when he's right I'm going to support him you didn't get that from John McCain I'm telling you God Bless John McCain and God rest his soul but\nLindsey Graham has gone back to being the Lindsey Graham I knew when he was in the house now the John McCain has gone I think once he got into the Senate\nJohn McCain was his mentor so he didn't want to do anything that upset John McCain of course John McCain was all about\nKissing the butt of everybody across the aisle that was his big thing you know he wanted everybody on the other side of the out of love him and he wanted to be that bipartisan guy and I think Lindsey Graham tried to do the same thing now that John McCain has gone Lindsey Graham's gone back to being the guy I knew when we were helping them with the impeachment of\nBill Clinton when he was in the house and it's been in the ... a marvelous that was a transformation a return to the original Lindsey Graham who was an
