least from two different counties were chasing the car through Nashville everything ended up being okay governor Andrew Cuomo says this weekend's deadly limo crash in upstate New York involved in improperly licensed driver and the vehicle that is a failed inspection\nThey drive rural here\nWill not have the driver's license operating here\nAt the wreck happened on Saturday afternoon when a group of four sisters\nTalking about how dangerous is it you know both sides do this to a certain degree both sides circle the wagons around their side I mean that's a natural thing\nBut this is a little bit more\nSerious because you've got a guy who was accused of trying to rape a woman and you're just going to assume because he's not of your party that he's guilty\nI said you should ask you about Keith Ellison because he would have been just as ill informed about that\nAnd then you could have set it up this way he's a good who's Keith Ellison well Keith Ellison is this Republican congressman whose wife said that he was beaten there and uh and uh he he should he should leave Congress wide guaranteed did it oh I say Republican you know he's a Democrat\nWell he probably didn't [laughter] and that's the way I'm telling you it's the way we have\nRunning concurrently without having all this is this is the ironic part of this whole thing that will never that history will never show running concurrently on a parallel track with all of this Kavanaugh stuff was a much more plausible\nMuch more believable accusation and certainly much more recent accusation against a sitting Democrat congressman\nOf nuts ... not you know fooling around maybe going too far of beating her up slapping her around verbally and physically abusing a woman and where did that go in the press know where where do they go in any kind of investigation where we added a law firm\nThey investigate it they said anything to of course his law firm gay five hundred thousand dollars to the Democrats including fifty thousand dollars Alison himself\nBut we're these folks out there where the where the pain can't people on the ... thing they know where to be found and the irony of an irony this going to be in the newspaper column this week I've already written it I mean usually I wait until tomorrow to write about written\nIt send it out Hillary Clinton\nWhat does the irony that she's making the rounds last week all over every we're talking about these women need to be believed well\nHow about all those women who accused Bill Clinton how about wanting to Broderick how not all about polish jokes having all these folks that I Know they've been bows who need to be destroyed\nAnd that's what James Carville came it wasn't on the ... the right wing that came up with is James Carville is the one who's calling the memo ruptured and those men do rushing out there\nWell why isn't Carville being called on the carpet by calling a victim who were supposed to believe or bend ball and also said they were living\nI Can't hear you I Can't hear myself then I'll go also said to they were living in trailer parks there're trailer park you drank five dollar bill so trade is what's come up with\nSome of the people who accused Clinton were memos and trailer trash that you could just drag five dollars to a trailer park and this which come up with I thought we were supposed to believe the survivors now they're all survivors well here's the thing\nYou're supposed to believe who you want to believe but you need to have some credible information\nThere is no pattern of behavior to Brett Kavanaugh and I'm not going to rehash do Brett Kavanaugh thing but there is a pattern of behavior for Bill Clinton and it was before he became\nWhat was before I even had the politics for crying out loud but it was certainly before he came to Washington DC and continued afterwards and everybody knew it including all of those folks around them they just knew that in order for him to survive politically you would have to destroy the survivors\nThat's for the call them no survivors the survivors of Bill Clinton need to be destroyed and you had George ... who was in the thick of all that with James Carville and Hillary Clinton ...\nGeorge snuff level as has now supposedly respected journalist and NBC\nAnd on good morning America and on this week without David Brinkley and the rest of this stuff\nHillary making the rounds as some sort of I only Yoda of the Democratic party ah and she's ... years she's supposed to be an expert on everything and then they had to do\nThese women need to be believed and not one person interviewing her says well should we believe the people that have lined up to accuse your husband are we supposed to\nBelieve them too well here's what I Know the liberals let me say this to take away the take away from this is this if you're a conservative you're guilty if you're a liberal you're not unless you happen to be Harvey Weinstein and they just had to sacrifice him because Harvey Weinstein was at the tip of the spear for me too movement\nBut the rest of it all depends on who we're going to believe\nBut most of the accusations and you can look this up for the meat to thing had been liberals it's been the liberals who have been accused the most thing and certainly the ones that are provable certainly the ones that are provable but that doesn't seem to matter\nOr if the Republicans were just ugly people and now to just destroying the hate women and so now we have Taylor Swift of all people and she's come out in support of an old white\nGuy over a woman to be in the Senate\nI thought we were supposed to be lifting women up putting women in positions of power oh that's right if they are Republicans no no no no no we need to to ride them\nWe need to ridiculed then when he did drive them out of politics so you're not for women you're not for minorities it's only liberals at your for this is why I call it the N. double A.\nB. C. it's not the national association a for a colored people if National Association with advancement of political correctness\nIf there were any other thing then they would have been for Clarence Thomas wouldn't they they would have supported Condi Rice\nPeople like this Tim Scott of South Carolina other people of color but they don't they only support liberals of color isn't that interesting\nAnd in their world you're only a survivor if you happened to be a liberal if you're a conservative while you're not a survivor you're part of the problem especially if you're a conservative who has accused the liberal of doing something untoward like sexual assault or rape or whatever you're certainly not to be believed\nThis is why this whole thing needs to be re calibrated\nWe need to recalibrate folks here is the deal we go back to the default on the machine you know the default on the machine is\nWe believe you if you have a credible accusation against somebody and it doesn't necessarily mean that you have other witnesses if there is a pattern of behavior\nIn this person whether it be Bob Packwood who was a Republican or Bill Clinton who's a Democrat then your case has more [noise]\nBut if you just come right out of the blue and accuse somebody thirty three years after the fact of something that there is no pattern in this person's life to indicate that he has ever done anything like this before or since\nThen you're gonna have to come with some proof and Dr Ford and not only came with no proof the proof she came with was completely discredited\nSo we have now Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court and here's the interesting thing one of the first things he did on the first\nDay on the job ladies and gentlemen Brett Kavanaugh has hired a black law clerk for his new chambers at the U.S Supreme Court\nRuth Bader Ginsburg that matches or record of black clerk ship she's hired one during the entire time she's been on the Supreme Court how about that\nWith his first clerk ship hires Kavanaugh also set of gender composition record an apparent attempt to buck the high court's hiring patterns which tend to favor white male graduates of elite law schools\nSince joining the high court Nineteen Ninety three this sort of the Daily Caller today Ginsburg has hired over one hundred law clerks\nBut I think those are done for us

man come on\nFolks say he's try what he's trying to do is he's trying to hold onto the crazy people but the Democrat Party in Tennessee and reach out to some of these folks on the other side of need he just drops them\nBeing cats at all oh my God they're right there on the on the ground pink hats on with ... or ... or so he's going to try to pick up the ... there are turning against you unless you're Taylor Swift\nAnd Taylor Swift has come out in favor of reticent when there is a woman in the race I thought she's missed big feminist and all of their\nFamily not and it\nSeems as though there's another one from yesterday CBS News and this isn't the cruise or war grace in Texas they got cruise up by six\nMhm\nYou folks in the ninth district of North Carolina if you're following that Harris versus mccready\nHarris the Republican up by five points I don't even know I haven't followed that so I don't even know whose district that is uh but uh the Republicans up by five any other that you might be interested in probably not as\nWell it's okay oh so water's for saying\nHere's one you might be instant near Dana Rohrabacher who's been a Republican in Congress for a long time he was actually down I Believe in that district too there were two the Democrat challenger now that's a tough guy so he may be coming back he may actually survive\nLet me sing yeah the firm on most but this is from back in July had the Democrat up by two and now we're buck or has come back the tide and the latest but who knows what's going to miss California you can never tell\nA and some of these other anyway\nMy point is when you look at the polling data out there you can always believe with a but you certainly don't do an average of polls over the last three months good grief whatever happened in July is ancient and may as well never happened whenever the poll that was taken in July is totally irrelevant now my right and I would tell you that\nAny poll taken in August or September is totally irrelevant now the only thing that matters now is the latest polling and you can't always be sure that that's accurate just saying now for those of you who've been paying attention Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court and I know\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nNow now now now that\n\nI'm like a ... these people or something so we have a schoolteacher\nAnd this is why we need to be calling these people a little bit more closely this is a school teacher from Minnesota and are these one week where she's made the yarn butterfly today that was September thirteenth Oh yes she's got a little yarn butterfly\nA that she's made and then\nUh she posted this when was this was this yesterday yeah yesterday\nWhat is the day it was yesterday she posted she went from yarn butterflies ah to this she says senior and I want to make sure yeah\nUh-huh\nWho's going to take one for the team and killed Kevin Oh\nYeah that's nice that's nice so who's going to take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh the reason I ask who is W. H. O. as any well that's a possessive who's like who's going is this or who's ... who's a who's\nA yarn butterflies that\nBut who is going to ... who uses a contract or who is going to take it should have been W. H. O. possibly so I Hope she's not teaching English\nBut I Hope she's not teaching an old and I hope that may be some money from the government has paid her a little visit her name is Samantha ness they won't let you rats\nWow this is over hood on overheard on duty\nAnd that was the Shiite I hear on duty is actually the real not simply spoken word that's OK on Twitter by the way\nBut God Forbid you put a ... something offensive\nAnyway they said well apparently this is an elementary school teacher time to make sure she finds a new profession\nAnd then they say well Samantha Schmidt is the leader Facebook and Twitter account it seems hard lesson and not being in a whole I suppose and then somebody posted her teaching license\nNumber her name was posted in one of her picks\nThis lined up with a resume she posted on weekly with pie I I won't senior here the same pictures of her or on the site which also show she graduated from the University of\nMinnesota and then they also [laughter] somebody you talking about going whole hog somebody has actually um\nPosted her report card from two thousand and four and her a swim lesson plans [laughter]\nI don't know how they got a hold of that but [laughter]\nMaybe she posted on the way back when but\nAt the Samantha ness instructor was Kim and this was from a this is from February fifth two thousand four\nAnd then they got all the comments and everything else on there and it says Hi Samantha ness usually not good to threaten violence on government officials and they're posting a report cards now so nothing sacred anymore is it [laughter]\nSo she's she threatens well ... I guess you could say that is a threat but what it\nBasically is is a solicitation to kill Brett Kavanaugh that's much better isn't it by the way Cabot on his first day hires as many black clerks is Ruth Bader Ginsburg has done an entire tenure one he put a black I think there's a woman\nHe's got like for a female clerks\nAnd I'm I'm telling you the left are saying what he's doing that so he can arrest them or maybe rape them or whatever\nAre their names forward he'll drop them they were drug them and then he'll take advantage of the week I learned this from Bill Cosby and then we have the homo phobic tweets from CNN White House reporter that have surfaced [noise] Oh yes and you've seen her probably Caitlin Collins\nShe's White House reporter for CNN [noise] well some nasty tweets that she had written a with condescending views towards members of the L G BP community\nWell as an arrogant attitude toward those Collins viewed as lower than herself the log cabin Republicans ironically we're the ones who called her out on this they discovered these quote unquote gay slurs and they posted the is let me see when these were actually\nThis from twenty eleven yeah\nTwenty eleven ladies and gentlemen what Seventy years ago she posted this prologue to Canterbury Tales you fag\nYeah so she's going to get fired for that because a lot of people get fired for a lot less\nOh there was somebody who owns the the other one is and I didn't quite understand this one LB okay if I Want to room with a lesbian\nI don't know the context so but\nApparently she's making fun of somebody being a lesbian what'd you just can't do if you're on CNN now now can you\nAnd CNN I don't think it's going to fire and I think she's now apologized of course show on that case fell everything's forget and I'm sure she cried and I'm sure she'll go to some kind of therapy right rehab yes yes yes uh politically correct rehab there was something else oh somebody\nUm tweeted this today and homeless thing because I had a ha ha ha this is all yeah this is something I tweeted this retweeted this\nI said this is something I Would be immediately fired for and I get paid to express my opinions this guy's a lunatic it's another Google person I'll tell you what he tweeted in just a moment but he has now believe that the tweets\nAnd um so I guess all is okay but this guy is I mean these people are nuts I'm just telling you how explain that would come back we'll take your phone calls to one eight hundred six one eight filled back in ...

paints three they're Luther you're on ... on pay to see the first Trump Card that says police convention\nI Believe that's the one I'm looking for go ahead and he he was speaking let me give you the abstract on this the long view is they put in here President Trump talked for about a half hour to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein during their flights today to Florida for speech to police chiefs around the world\nAnd then a Trump said this\nYet these brave ice officers have been subjected to shameless attacks by leading members of the Democratic party including outrageous calls to abolish ice\nAnd also they're not a big help to us in law enforcement they don't want to give us the kind of funds that people are requesting but getting them anyway because we're giving them to you but they fight is at every turn\nThey find them when they return so then he talked to ... got to be talking about the support that these police deserve\nThank you as well to our deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein for being here flew down together the press wants to know why did you talk about [noise]\nSo we had a very good talk I Will say\nMan that's not the kind of like ... says the good says police police convention we support you into man as to what I'm looking for right today\nI stand before you as president of the United states to tell you that my administration will always honor cherish and support\nThat men and women in blue and we are proud to do is\nSee some of the Democrats won't do this so the Democrats saw in the police and the bad guys we need to investigate the police were locked up the police the police are arbitrarily killing black was going to come down on the street and he got a president who goes in speaks to an association of police chiefs from around the world and says we're proud of you\nYou don't hear this from the left and they should be all you need to know about where they're coming from they're not proud of the police they have the police\nAnd you've got to wonder playing now I'm I'm not going to city and tell you that every police officers great they're bad apples in police departments just like they're bad apples in anything but that doesn't ... up one bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch girl\n... minutes for you from back in the day\nAnd that's the way the president looks at the police to by and large the police do a fantastic job except yesterday trying to close off and offer him so one of my kids\nGets in an accident yesterday on the interstate and let me tell you how this happened\nYou know you have you have an off ramp and then you'll have a split to go to two different directions so this is where a four forty in our town goes to sixty five sixty five south going towards Huntsville and then they're sixty five north which goes back up in the town\nWell apparently somebody who was working on the road for the ramp one sixty five north so when you got awful for forty you're on a ramp right well that ramp splits the two one goes south one goes north\nThere's a cop car just sitting in the ... in the middle of the ah off ramp from the north so all of a sudden people are going well I Can't go there so they go they have to go south and figure out what they're going to do and some people see it just before they get off so everybody starts slamming on breaks\nAnd so my kid um swerve to keep from running in the back of this one woman hit a retaining wall the guy behind hurt if he if if that guy hit my kid\nAt that philosophy he hit this woman that was in front of my son smashed her car all the way up to the back window and I can't imagine in the low pay and came to my kid was [laughter] what it would have done and I'm going and you know the tea that folks are the guys with the big trucks and they're going\nWhat are these people doing what they're supposed to tell us when they're closing off a rant why this we're supposed to go out there and put signs and ... you know station ourselves with say slow down and so as we're sitting there as the writing of the police report there's another accident right there too there's still nothing you know [noise]\nAnyway so please don't always do the right thing [laughter]\nBut in ... in general and I'm not criticizing the police at large in general the police do a fabulous job when you hear that from anybody on the left\nAnd you know why you want to hear from anybody on the left is because they're afraid that they're going to hack off the crazy constituency that is the core of the Democratic party it's a combination of paint cats

Rob our cannot I was taken into custody for they changed the Mohammed Ali cause I guess\nThe boxer and he was taken into custody for months ago on the Turkish border at the time he was whether it's Canadian wife former Vancouver resident rod ah a read a Jabbar and their two children born in Syria\nHis family's being detained at a camp not far from the prison were Kurdish American and British officials had been interrogating Mohammed Ali but here's the deal\nHis uh his capture is significant because aside from serving as a sniper Eileen use social media to encourage others to join ISIS in conduct terrorist attacks\nThey say that he was trying to ah meet back up in Canada with about four hundred\nAssuming forty forty\nKnown terrorists that have moved back into Canada\nAnd he's ... apparently to plant something it sounds like to me so far we have three ISIS fighters to women and five children until they're ten Canadian citizens of the fighters or in prisons and the women are in a A N children are in the camps\nThis is a a dual Kareem Omar co chairman of the foreign affairs for the Democratic self administration of northern Syria\nA told the global news in an interview that

under his tenure these folks have managed to get get back into Canada and apparently you know when you\nGo join ISIS and they send you back to your home country what do you think this and you're back to do\nWhile they're sending your back to of course kill people in that country or perhaps it's even more sinister than that maybe they're sending them back to go to Canada so they can get easily in the United states and pull off some sort of terrorist attack\nWell this is why we need to be ever vigilant about this kind of stuff but you can't profile you know because\nPeople don't like that\nIn the meantime and again I'm not anti immigrant at all or refugee you we got people who were legitimately\nRunning from something horrible and we can do something about bad then I think that we should but on Saturday to women went to a pro Aquarius rally in France when they laugh now this is this is this is a pro\nMigrants thing\nIf you have you folks seeing Jack Ryan that are OK with that's with a gym from the office it's good but it they they throw in some political correctness and they sort of make it the understandable why they are so many terrorists in France because you're either French or you're not\nYou cannot be something else but for instance so it's it's like they don't fit in well then I'm going well then go back where you came from your not fitting in don't blow people up or cut

bit better than we are but why is it is right now you're righteously indignant based on the airport because of course they did\nOr are you a terrorist no do you want to be safe because the terrorists look just like you so if we stop looking at people like you just because you're offended the plane's gonna blow up do you want to blow up the plane\nOkay well then you're going to have to undergo a little more scrutiny than anybody else\nIt's the same thing if you're a white male in your twenties and they're looking for a serial killer they're looking for somebody who looks like you if they stop somebody at a road stop with the police\nAnd you happen to be a black female of fifty five years old or going to wait you're on through them and looking for you even though we don't even know what this guy looks like we know wedding her\nBecause the profile of a serial killer usually is a young white male\nAnd so that's who they look for when they're looking for a serial killer if there's a man on for a serial killer\nAnd young white males should understand that the you're going to fit the profile so this is the way you do up until the last few years is the way you did great police detective work\nIs you gotta you gotta several steps ahead because you were able to profile folks and now profile is an ugly word profile is a police to your profile all sorts of folks\nAnd then chances are you end up catching the bad guy because you already are two or three steps further down the road and you would be if you didn't profile is every terrorists going to always be an Arab or Muslim no but look
