I asked\nYou're trying to make sure I'm not sure\n... fashion show they show like cabbage patch I\nShould have actual kites launched from Baltimore is really the ascension to watch ...\nWhen I was doing this when I first started this about fourteen years ago I had my blood test run my vitamin D was down to nine yes nine a that was pretty low I was shocked and that's when I started digging in finding out what's going on with vitamin D\nWhere we want your vitamin D is about fifty five to eighty we wanted a high normal\nIs where we want that a vitamin D and of course a with a thyroid we checked the the the T. three that the for the free T. three the free T for a that tells us all the pathways for that we also check the cholesterol\nOr when you come to my office just before you do a detox we actually do a ... which is a cholesterol panel we want to know where those numbers are before you do the detox after the detox you do a full blood panel and then we're going to check the numbers to see how they've improved by doing the detox\nAnd we look at your particle size or we're not just relying on the numbers of the cholesterol or the numbers are I mean you got kind of look at the numbers but\nCompared to particle size you want to look at the particle size of your cholesterol now there's two sizes pattern a and pattern be pattern a is the big size of the uh cholesterol you could think of the big and fluffy kind of like a cotton ball that does not stick to the arteries\nA pattern ... be is small you could think of that like a baby and those are the ones that stick to the arteries so let me give you an example your cholesterol comes back it's textbook book perfect and then we looked at the particle size and you have pattern be\nWhich means that that cholesterol is going to stick onto the arteries\nSo what happens is uh what kind of still take action were really concerned about that if you're you're a cholesterol comes back textbook perfect and your pattern a guess what we were not too concerned about that\nWell let's say that your cholesterol was a little high your LDL was high say it's a hundred and sixty hundred and eighty and you're a particle size of your cholesterol comes back ... a a which is a good one we're not too concerned about that even though you're running high numbers you may just run high numbers\nWhat else would make you run high cholesterol guess what your thyroid\nI have yet to have a patient come in and say hey my cholesterol went up so my doctor checked my thyroid no they don't do that unfortunately so what happens is your cholesterol creeps up there and it goes up and it gets to a certain number and the doctor says okay um we need to put you on a cholesterol medicine which is a stat and drug\nIt's the second worst mark worst drug on the market in my opinion uh the first being antidepressants it's so easy to bring your cholesterol down naturally in my opinion nobody should be honest and drug because it's so easy to bring the cholesterol down\nSo we're going to find out particle size and it's not really the cholesterol that causes the a heart disease your arteries have to be damaged first and what damages the arteries sugar sugar causes inflammation and there\nAre that's why we say Seventy five net cards or below which is normal it's not low carbs it's normal\nSo sugar will get into the arteries it'll damage the arteries it causes inflammation they kind of split or if you could imagine like a board splinters now we've got some rough areas there and that particle beak cholesterol can stick to their and then it starts building from there\nSo it's really the underlying issue now the cholesterol was involved in it but it's not the cause of it\nIf you've ever looked at an artery the artery itself is flick and smooth it's super smooth you're you're as that blood is traveling through there at a hundred miles an hour it cannot have a lot of friction in on the artery so they're smooth but when they get damaged or inflamed\nNow we have the potential for that bad cholesterol pattern to be to step there so that's one way that we are talking about the news the blood test that's all from a blood test of and that's just one test that we will talk about uh the a hair analysis when we come back\nAfter this break [noise]\nOkay Leon soccer practice it for my I have cancer sex Katie how softball\nWayne

Service and the council\n\nListeners will know\nThis is Dr Brian Foley I Am your alternative Dr meaning that we don't use a drug will cut things out of you in the name of a health\nAnd we don't burn things out of you in the name of health what we do is we give you real food to food [noise] genuine\nReplacement parts whole food and that's what we're missing in our society we're not getting the food our food supply\nHas dwindled down to process duff uh we're missing the nutrition that's why we have an epidemic of sick people running around and that's why we have the average person over sixty on six to eight different medications\nNow I have nothing against medication except we should be looking at medication as a short term solution not a long term solution\nWant to read you a success story here that I just found it says I can finally go outside\nAnd this is somebody that came to my office you came to the workshop she liked what she heard she started her program her customized program I should say\nAnd a says what was it like before you came to see us I was extremely fatigue had brain fog had photo sensitivity to the point that I could not go outside even in the shade also my skin rash was just wouldn't go away\nHow is the no I have less fatiguing brain phone I'm sleeping better I'm going outside in the sun and my skin rashes has not really occurred\nAnd I have less joint pain thanks Dr Foley now that could be your success story to this is very very common in our office for people to be suffering for many many years and come in and this will turn around I don't have a date on how long that took but we're talking probably\nTwelve weeks maybe at the most sixteen weeks at the most and this person was suffering with a skin rashes couldn't even go outside and her eyes are so sensitive and we weren't even working on her eyes it just uh\nJust happens that way I had a lady come in one time and we were working with her she was actually in her supportive care and oh\nShe woke up one morning she put her glasses on and she couldn't see out of um everything was blurry so she thought oh my eyes must got worse so she made a a a plane with her eye doctor went down and he tested image has no they got better you don't need your glasses anymore and we weren't even working on her eyes so things will clear up as long as you get the body healthy\nOr I Want to read one more a review here and it says Dr Foley is help my wife and\nAnd I in an amazing way of renewal health my heart is doing better than it has for years as well as my energy my wife and I were having difficulty ah everything that needed to be done\nUh having difficulty doing everything that needed to be done but Dr Foley has renewed our health he he is the first place I go when I have a problem or need with my health\nHe has never failed me or my wife I recommend him often well thank you for that and that is one of our a patient and a lot of people will use my office as\nA place to stay healthy if they um first of all it's a little bit on the rare side if somebody doesn't stay healthy but when somebody does need to get a cold or sniffles or a tired they will come to the office and we'll\nGet them well and how do we get them well well we used the traditional response testing to do that\nNow most of these tests that we've been talking about for the last hour and a half are things that are done on a new show evaluation as we're going through here and it's done periodically throughout their care depending on the person and we were talking about hair analysis we talked about the a blood test\nAnd how I evaluate that in that there's two different types of ranges functional ranges versus laboratory ranges I use the functional ranges\nAre most doctors use laboratory ranges which are disease ranges then we also talked about the hair analysis the hair analysis will give us our first glimpse on what heavy metals or the bodies dealing with it'll push 'em out through the hair and will know that they're in the body\nOr the hair analysis also has different ratios in it ... your blood sugar sugar outside the arteries the checks you're a thyroid or is it running too fast running too slow your adrenal says it running too fast running too slow your overall vitality uh we ended up with talking about zinc copper\nZinc copper very strange a unique both of those and everything in your body needs zinc\nThe problem is that the copper will build up in the body there's copper and everything you eat so that builds up in the body is actually called hidden copper toxicity\nAnd then we know that the person is low on zinc we do a zinc tests like I said in the last segment\nIt's a little liquid they put it on their tongue they hold it for thirty seconds spit it out should taste like a metal if it doesn't do we know there's ... deficient or and then we'd go to see if we can get zinc in and we might not be able to uh the body might not accept that zinc\nAnd the reason it won't is because there's too much copper and the body\nAnd I've had a ... men come in and I tell them they're sink to fish and they said all that's impossible I been taken zinc for Twenty years well their bodies not absorbing the zinc\nSo what happens is the thing goes in one in and out the other they're just wasting their money on that so you have to pull that copper out just like you'd have to pull a heavy metal out it's called a\nHidden copper toxicity and you only see that on a hair analysis [noise]\nUh then we also can check the calcium and phosphate now the calcium phosphate and again this comes out of a hair analysis tells us about the high gear in low gear or whether you're stuck in high gear you're running too long in high gear like when we wake up we ... we have this high gear\nIt's called the sympathetic are you running in high gear too long and we also have what's called the Paris sympathetic when you go to sleep you're supposed to drop into that low gear and get that good quality sleep\nNow believe it or not we have a people that are stuck in high gear they're laying there looking like they're sleeping but inside their clients and organs are running like um\nLike they're awake now how would you know that you wouldn't unless you come to my office and get checked\nAnd how do you get to my office again the best way to get to the office is through the workshop once you attend the workshop I also give you a discount or ... normally to if you just call in and say hey I'm not coming to your workshop it's three hundred and forty eight dollars\nZero zero five six that six one five three three three zero zero five six to see if you and say hey I Want doctor fully to buy me dinner\nI Will be glad to buy your dinner and we're going to have the workshop a at a

PM also so just call for the special dinner workshop to see if you qualify for that [noise]\nAll right so what are you gonna learn at the workshop you're going to learn how to get healthy stay healthy do it naturally we're gonna talk about uh the cells were going to talk about ... toxins were going to talk about hormones\nWe're gonna talk about the thyroid a thing called ... and you probably don't know what that is unless you habits or we're going to talk about the adrenal glands and we'll talk about whatever you want to talk about I go around the room ask why you're here and a pick up more information that we customize these workshops to your\nParticular um\nConcern now we did have a workshop yesterday and I want to read you some feedback from some of the people that came and we always get a a survey and we ask them or what did you like about the workshop uh I like the way Dr Foley broke down the systems and talked about a individual organs okay\nWhat did you like about the workshop it covered all three areas I've been wondering about as the cause of some\nRecent symptoms are adrenal style Roy deliver All right well did you like about the workshop everything it was very very informative what'd you like about the workshop and these are people that came to the workshop\nAll all of it was great the info was great I learned a lot it'll be very very helpful what'd you like about the workshop oh it was great info All right what did you like about the workshop small size great information All right\nUh what did you like about the workshop all the information All right you get the point everybody is getting something out of this workshop and if you haven't been to the workshop you need to attend it\nIs coming up and we got the first one coming up on Tuesday the thirtieth at six thirty PM and then we have a special dinner workshop you see you can call to see if you qualify for that dinner workshop and that's at a six thirty PM but that's on\nTuesday November the thirteenth so we've got a couple of weeks before the dinner workshop but I wanted to give people a fair warning that that is coming up so\nYou can call six one five three three three zero zero five six that's six one five three three three zero zero five six All right so much about the workshop so now we're going to go in and talk a little bit more about the saliva test\nThere are there is another saliva test we just got done talking about the slide protest for your adrenal switch checks that circadian rhythm which means that you're ... are released quarters all at certain times throughout the day\nWe test that through the ... the reason we use Sliwa versus um\nBlood is hormones in the blood are attached to protein so they're unusable to the body we want to do what's usable to the body so we use the hormones or the saliva test and that gives us free and available hormones to the body\nSo we can also do a test that's very very very ...\nFull for women that are having a problem with their period with their cycle I'm this takes a month to do this test it's eleven different uh vials and what the person does the female uh once he starts her period day one two or three she would spit into this little tiny vial and should fill it up with spin\nA bench she's going to put that in the fridge writer and said that none of these are all labeled so there are certain days that you do this and about every third day after that she would fill up the bile while at the end of a loving days which is approximately thirty days or to do it all I'm\n... ... ... that gets mailed out to the lab and what the lab does is that puts it into a pattern so we can look and see like the\nThe the beginning of the period that uh the estrogen should be high in the projects drone should be low up to about a day of Thirteen fourteen\nOf the ah estrogen should peak about the uh Thirteen fourteen and then it should start to drop down and then the ... towards the uh second part of the cycle should go up so we're going to get a pattern of that and see is that going on\nAnd I've seen this where the estrogen as opposed to peak in the beginning of the cycle speaking at the end of the cycle I've seen the pro Jess throne which is supposed to be very very low at the beginning of the cycle way too high and these are women that are having a menstrual cramps they're having problems getting pregnant\nI'm a lot of times they'll get this on the ovaries that's due to too much estrogen are all kinds of things can happen when the cycle is out\nOr they don't look let's put it this way they don't look forward to having a there period\nOr if you don't look forward to having your period there's something wrong there now we're also looking at other things of course it tells us about the testosterone and there there's a thing called um [noise]\nA project her own priming ah estrogen priming and making sure that these things are are moving left they're supposed to\nSo what's the value of this uh test uh especially when we're doing a whole thirty day test the female a cycle test\nOr the value is at certain times of the month we could actually put in nutrition and targets that time so let's say that the estrogen is too low at the beginning of the cycle well there are certain supplements that will push that estrogen up\nAnd get that to peek out or maybe the a ... a project thrown isn't going up high enough at the uh second part of the cycle again certain herbs and vitamins will push that up and we can get that cycle back in\nUsually takes to correct a cycle a minimum of Ninety Days three cycles of going through the period when we're targeting those particular areas so those that we do when a women are having a hard time on their cycle where they come in and they say that they're having um [noise] menstrual problems\n[noise] All right I hear that music coming up we're going to wrap up this show\nUh hopefully you got some out of that I Know I went over a lot of technical stuff we only got through half of the ... half of the tests that I actually\nDo and other doctors don't do a if you have any questions on that what you need to do is you need to come to the workshop\nAnd ask your questions they're\nAll right we're going to wrap this up and I'll see you this coming Tuesday the thirty six thirty PM at the workshop you then [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThis this morning we go to ... million women who have joined in the war effort now make up thirty seven percent of the workforce changing their\nInterest interest medical school just breaking ground opening its new applicants\nToday little girls all over the world look to the sky where the first woman who's now in space [noise]\nMilitary stereotypes of challenge today with the trailblazing promotion us female officer to four star general\nIt was just announced that the vast majority of last year's doctor degrees were earned by women\nWe've come so far but our news is changing for the worse more women die from heart disease and stroke than men even though it can be prevented make a change I'd go read for women dot org today ... by the ad council and the American Heart Association go read for women\n\nWere on Saturday Night\nAnd every one of us and that stress and believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body but don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and\nGive us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural in alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nSimply a lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nYou know so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relax your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who aren't paid\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking that count max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type paying\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of area that I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nIt's a vicious circle that I like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more rest or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting phone line is you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah in your body is actually starting to manifest at\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and

be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing to do their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time you up to the point where they don't realize

team and I had a number of athletes using this before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up and their mothers were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition

help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWhile diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin in the body but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D three does that taste that problem\nAnd it seems to fix it now they've studied vitamin D three and it didn't prove this insulin it sure

just re camping here that there are a couple of different\nForms of vitamin D it made me explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf deep formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body so has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's the best because I've seen the best results\nWith myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the deal is going to end up going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and the humidity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on

the middle\nOf August I've been seeing lots of kids going back to school and Greg you've just moved\nYours into college you know we've got to go get a puppy oh you guys must happy or no as a puppy up because he's gone now Isaac gone replaced it with the oh um well I haven't\nDone that yet but I Do and next week I take\nUm I've got one senior in high school but he is playing for his first time away from with hockey and then um my oldest um is playing in the north American League so there will be some crocodile tears when this um and then a week I Know we've got a great summer though and\nI still see them pretty much um weekends because I'm a hockey mom through and through so\nI'm a before the break we were talking about\nUm are we in another housing bubble and I do think this is really the buzz around the country right now um if you look at\nThe different markets especially the big on metro cities um of what's going on there um\nHow I like to look at it and it's definitely a debate um one thing you can say really not for it is the new the last recession and the last ... bubble came at two thousand seven ... right and and that's ten years ago and usually every ten years\nThere is some sort of correction ruined that's just the numbers that it's just if you look at the graphs that's the way it worse or\nAnd but one of the key metrics that really goes through this is home prices so we do see we we say oh you know home prices are going up I mean that's a lot of what we talk especially here locally rock about that\nBut if you look at the facts on according to Cora logic they reported the U.S median cells prize in June two thousand six was two hundred and forty seven thousand one hundred and ten dollars\nCompared to Marge two thousand Eighteen was two hundred and Thirteen thousand four hundred was the median price across America\nSo if you look at that there's not the inflation is not now that was two thousand six was right before everything crash\nAre you know the the bubble yet I'm which then we knew it was coming to I mean we always say well we know it's coming but what do you do we just kept going right [laughter] right [laughter]\nBut here we are there are so home prices can be debated now let's talk here locally part of just really ... we don't have facts were talking to the facts that we know dealing with the industry every day there are parts of town that has definitely skyrocketed and cost\nBut why have they because we were so low on inventory you know new construction comes in which we needed but it it does cost money to build home there and so you know I had a home that was a new construction that took a while it was it beautiful and it was in\nA hot part of Franklin it took a while to get under contract and people were like it's over priced at ... ... it was priced out according to what it costs to bill and it was just it's more expensive to build land is more expensive now\nBut when you look at those prices and they're still gauge off of cops and really what's happening here locally what's your take on it\nI was at a function last night and this guy and he he asked me you know what's my take on it and I'm asked him about his situation and he bought a home for short term rentals\nAnd it was a tear down and he paid I don't know I think is how it's seven hundred fifty thousand for it and now it's not legal for him to sell their home as a short term rental home\nAnd he's looking at values now instead of the seven fifty because there's a lot of homes that looked like his that were purchased for that reason and he's looking at maybe six fifty on the market\nBecause it's no longer it can no longer be a short\nTerm is right and there was a lot of homes built like that for that one purpose why a lot of like minded people\nSo that's a that's an unusual pocket that were ... that that's a natural that you know it's not tested yet really water it's with what's going to happen to a lot of those homes that look like that with a lot of buyers that look like those buyers\nI don't know I mean if if a lot of them start putting them on the market that is going to be great because it's going to help out our image or but at the same time if a lot of them put it on the market simultaneously\nUm that'll correct so I think you're going to have pockets of correction in some areas where people just went a little bit hot and and then we'll come back before as we might not see that same thing happen and you know when no one's\nYou know I well you definitely without the low end and tore right and so it started the new construction right and then you started investors pouring in and buying which now you've got calm switching up prices\nSo I mean it's it's just a very different market I Do not think it's the same market is two thousand six but there's definitely areas of softening and we see that because ... is the price matters in this market I'd never dealt with the market that price matters as much as\nI feel like it matter are now if you're home is overpriced\nBuy your pants on your head [noise] we'll purging hard to do and just two minutes two minutes twice a day making sure they brush their teeth is easier if we could help save them from a lifetime to France to into a subtle divide I come from a partnership for healthy miles ... actually\n[noise]\nWhile the the voice of NASA Lewis show I'm very dire in Studio with me as bracket and accepted BBC market\nAnd we're talking about all the oil or say if you have a ... attack said six\nOne five to three two forty three hundred we are talking about our market um what is really um all over the headlines are are we headed towards another housing bubble a we've looked at for key metrics and really debating each of them and I feel like\nI'm definitely we are in a different market um things are nothing like they were in two thousand six and a totally different\nUm I Do think price matters in this market and I do think you need to be smart in any situation in really gather all the facts we do have homes that when they are price correctly and they are staged and they're gone yes they are selling quickly\nAnd we love that but we also see those homes that are sitting out there on the market but usually\nI usually when I go look at um there's a definite reason and it may simply just be as price and I mean\nI'm again price matters so home prices as they've won\nWe've spent some time talking about mortgage on I Am thrilled with the mortgage options that we have of today on overall do grade do you see more people taking the lesser downpayment um options are are you still see in ten Fifteen twenty percent down\nIt depends on you know the person's age where they are financially I'm the more you put down the cheaper your product your mortgage insurance industry trying to be\nBut I Would say our younger generation doesn't have the savings a lot of times and so they're wanting a hundred percent financing which is out there and ... to my people and certain income categories\nAnd that's that's something that used to not be around here I mean I think the biggest ... you know even gosh five to ten years ago the biggest hardship of buying a house as what the down payment\nYeah yeah and so if you're the key number that if you can like you are listening out there and you're trying to think of well okay what\nWhat's an amount of money that I can put into really benefit me well three percent I mean if you can think of three if you can find a way to save three percent of your cells prize ... there's some great incredible programs out there for you\nThat will keep your mortgage insurance somewhat lower than a hundred percent loan and your interest rate better\nAnd that price point you would need to stay with them as what\nWell at three percent down the maximum aren't like four hundred and Ninety four thousand um but I mean a lot of yeah yeah\nThat is and sang right but that has increased it as yeah yeah for sure so on said three percent down okay foreclosure rates um of course a big key metric when you're looking at are we in trouble is how many\nThe closures now my entire business from two thousand seven to really early two thousand eleven with foreclosures and that's all I did come on and\nOn foreclosures in short cells a day or almost non existent and I mean we we have those accounts and we do work some that they are nowhere and I mean they're they're like I said if I have\nTwo closings among unfolding closure that's like a big mutt now where in the past it would be thirty to forty closing so it was a big difference so definitely I'm not seeing that here locally\nAnd I can't speak for the United states on that but overall and do know the numbers say they are extremely low across the nation because of course and that's why if you look at\nThe investors there's always been investors investors are still buying things but they're buying different type things because back you know two thousand seven to two thousand ten they did buy the foreclosure property now they're buying as you said on the other like short term rentals\nOn things to convert condos to convert into rental properties or you know there's different ways or commercially says even have really gone back here from\nThe um ... what what we're talking about on the brake too is that I'm\nFifty eight percent of millennials claim that are home purchases being the best decision and they can make is down um it's it's fifty eight percent of them think that it's a good decision which is actually the lowest it's been in the last two quarters\nMeaning that quarter to quarter the millennial is more and more disenfranchised and um you know I think it's just interesting to me that a statistic that thirty two percent of them claim that they are not able to buy a house do to not being able to save enough money due to their diet [laughter]\nDietary yeah so we got some healthy millennial\nThirty three percent of them have not been able to save that three percent down because they have a ... you know why\nThey want to eat healthy but they want to go out to eat and they want a house right oh they're like trying to balance and they want the house to be in urban enough area the shake him walk her die store yeah they're twelve dollar ... lifestyle and ... and ... and\nWe can lie laugh about it but it is very true I had a just a day for twelve dollars an hour [laughter] anything now you're going to cut back you got to cut back on your house is likely to get it that\nUm that no you know those things are expensive and if that's the lifestyle that they are seeking I mean the sushi ... mean ... ... and they\nEat out at nice you know really cool fun places that I Love to go myself and its expenses\nWell we are seeing 'em when I said is different is that change it's a change with our new consumer and although we have all generations we sell to of course\nYou we still always go back to the largest generation is now in their thirties and that is the millennials right I mean that so we've got this huge\nPopulation that you know they think\nAnd want ... differently you know and when it comes to housing that the previous generations half measure\nIt I say that now I've got a lot of my baby boomers are now becoming empty nesters and they're on the millennial wagon to LA like that lifestyle as well so um you know we do see we see it all out there but to your point it's a\nDifferent market ... on I'm not quite ready to say we're in a bubble for me I'm just not because things are selling they are marketed as good we do have people moving here\nI Will say totally different market though eggs and\nI agree with everything on well in the last thing comes down to housing affordability right you know and that still debated really across all metro cities because before your Nashville in\n... how many people really or just desiring to live downtown now it's just booming and the prices are booming too\nBut so much of that is being in a awesome city sure you know you you look at Denver downtown it's great for the prices downtown are high to assure you know a Minneapolis I mean the big cities you know we don't even want to talk about the California prices but again so we do see\nLess housing affordability downtown Nashville\nBut when you do talk about a board ability you can certainly go out the parts of summer county you can go to a rather for you can go to Marie I mean there are areas that are extremely affordable\nBut then you know we didn't talk about commute times sure so um you know that and definitely a huge debate here locally in a debate across the country\nI'm I'm helping her family come from Los Angeles and we compared with compared for me the cost of living differences\nAnd they're retiring and it's almost double their income that they're getting you know after expenses after not having to pay state income tax not having to pay\nYou know all the different things they're literally having more two times the disposable income in Nashville and that was their number one\nRed they're coming from California so yes they come out west they come from a newer and ... you know so I Do think it's where you're\nComing to find love locally in your mind said thank you so much for ten and then today we're here again to answer any questions you may have regarding all things real estate thank you see you next Sunday\nNursing bail Nashville\nYou were talking about I mean I [noise]\nRitual in Pittsburgh Brazil's new president prime Evan hanging\nIf you're not healthy if you don't sleep well if you don't wake up arrested if you have chronic illness and disease in your body\nAnd you don't really understand the true ratios of your body job was they they used to make fun of me 'cause when I was so big in my in my gym classes Emma my P. classes my health and human form of classes I heard one kid tell me so I waste so much that ... that my shadow wait five pounds so I understand what it's like to be big an overweight and obese and\nAnd again you don't have to settle for that you don't have to accept\nThat's as part of your future we've got people standing by right now we have coaches transformation coaches experts right now standing by to help you for free six one five one five zero three nine zero six one five eight one five zero three nine zero and we've got a special guest coming to the microphone coach\nWe sure do our special guest transfer him of the week is Mitch Owens in a major either with us Yes sir I Want to induce Mitch ah\n'cause I had been uh the one who's had the privilege of coaching Mitch Mitch is a truck driver a still driving around and a half to\nProbably working more hours maybe once I don't know it was a really good to get them into a writer you're going to be given the proper intro coach east bound and down Eighteen we're ... we had a lot of these days they can be done we got a long way to go and a short time to get there to just hammer down and watch me it's run\nA very good editor proper intro out 'cause that's that's what he does and and again it's interesting ah when I talk to me that I talked to some of the day Mitch or\nWho is just kind of concerned that can a truck driver do this program you know they look at their hours and if they're driving and certainly they do have some some challenges but uh I guess that's where I'm going to just start with a you know where you're at you came in truck driver or and can you answer that question what can a truck driver do this program\nAbsolutely\nAnd why do you say that ... what are the what are the things that make it do before a truck driver just a generally speaking what\nHe had really [noise] you know a buy at the edge a little bit but if he wants to do it bad enough if you want to find a way to justice so that he can't do it\nAnd out go ahead I'm Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt emphatic go ahead\nAnd and what motivated you are you are at when you first came in for that seminar um you've been doing a program when did you get started\nA last April first February somewhere right around there\nOkay so what what what what were you at that time and what ... what prompted you to to to kind of responding in income to lead to know the three sixty seminar\nOil the or the or pay rent you start getting a lot harder to have or they are better for cash and I was having a blood pressure problems are a lot closer to three hundred pounds that I wore a debate\nAnd is very little exercise at all I Will be out of breath and are not really able to do very much at all and I I Would just say that they like that and I wanted to get the things that are controlled and get that headed back in the right direction ...\nOr ... let me tell you about Mitch Mitch is just one of those man he is just steady uh our last email I told him I said I don't know I bring the scale over anymore Mitch the enhanced by the ... that we use because again I just kind of already know what you're going to be doing\nOn that scale 'cause you're one of those who every ... every single time you just you make progress I Know you said he liked to make a little faster like all of us would but the key to our bodies responding well you're making progress each time you're close to sixty pounds of fat last right now that body mass index change\nYou have lost her body fat percentage you gain muscle gain hydration you're losing inches\nA all those things are happening as you've gone through the\nProgram is that correct\nThat is correct or where I was out three blood pressure medication for that book that while I was out now down to a ... a lot better uh just overall feel a lot better that when I originally started as or like night and day difference\nIs it helping you actually do your job what about the is this the driving aspect I Know that you got 'em\nYou know that what what about the driving aspect\nUh yeah I can get out of the better I have a gift that way a lot of anger during the day before I was writing a lot of it that out I have not had it out over the fence probably second awake in February\nA that's great so coach his ratios are definitely in proven making progress in ... and that's a big key that people focus on ratios and not that scale weight number\nWell I mean I set out a video to our clients are a few months ago called I got I'm getting a divorce and I know that ... behind that because of the title\nBut what I was with the contacts was was albums divorcing mass scale because years ago when I was trying to get healthy I Know that the scale way was really a mythological monster to me and most people don't even understand what a ... but the great news is\nThat we want to offer you all of our listeners right now we want to offer you a free health risk assessment\nAnd a free personal ... and that's right that's about a hundred and Ninety nine dollar value you an opportunity for free to come in and see what your numbers are see what your ratios are and then you can get a much clearer picture of what your body actually is doing because those three digits on a scale don't really tell you much\nUh yeah might tell you that you're out of weight range a little bit but it's not going to give you the real number in a true reflection of what your health looks like and so\nI said that video our coach and then I talked a little bit about you know throwing ... scale weights of us go away because at that time I just had a normal scale I didn't have a bio skiing and that little machine that I got on every morning it seemed like I got on an everyday because I wanted to see it even one or two pounds\nOf a what a difference made me feel good or feel bad and it often felt like that scale was judging me now I don't know if I can talk to anybody out there and get real with people but when you get on that scale and you look at that and those numbers and they looked like they are your enemy and they're trying to judge you that can be the worst enemy when you're trying\nTo get healthy but you don't have that's not the end all be all and it's not the road to your health by the way\nA and it may be working against you and this is why I recommend that you don't get on scales that often at least until you understand what you're ratios are\nAnd so we don't talk a little bit on the next segment about really with important numbers in your body not just the scale way\nBut the important numbers of your body but right now again that we got coaches standing by we want to help you\nWe want to encourage that we want to motivate you you can be the next Mitch Owens right now a truck driver over the road sixty pounds of\nFat go on a in a hectic schedule in a truck all day long if you can do it in a truck Mitch that means somebody else can do it right now listen to the sound of my boys and again we're so proud of you and what you've done and what you've been able to accomplish already off one blood pressure medication\nAnd on the way to the next two I guarantee you and that's the thing about the science of cellular held\nIf you'll do things in the right order is guaranteed results we have seen people reverse diabetes and just thirty days or less I'm Talking about type two diabetes gone forever\nAll insulin off met form and we've seen blood pressure reverse within thirty days we've seen cholesterol issues reverse within thirty days we see people sleeping well waking up arrested we see people having energy throughout the day living life to the full playing with their kids and grandkids and that's so important to understand that your life is passing by\nAnd if you don't act on your life your life will act on you and I teach my kids this very simple principles if you'll do what's hard your life will become easier and getting healthy for many people was very difficult it is confusing but it doesn't have to be but if you'll do what's easy your life will become harder and you don't want your life\nTo become harder you want to take advantage of the time that you have right now to get healthy at a state level and be all that you were created to be [noise]\nYeah that's right because uh again now's the time I mean we talk about it as well as this one life to live and you got to take opportunity in ... or you know the great value that health has for you so\nYou mentioned we kind of and this uh first second we're going to bring it back on the second ... and just kind of talked a little bit more about that a ... and your journey but uh you get a great job and and just getting started and I I just get a sense in the field from cocaine you that uh again it's going to be a snare situation where you are creating that healthy lifestyle for you\nAnd uh just the fact that you've already talked about how you know the diet drinks in the in the coffee with so many people are dependent on coke you're kind of a big drinker at one time and stuff like that\n... a silver bullet ... di ... I'm not giving them a plug but I just called it the silver bullet to non alcoholic silver bullet that was my drink right there and in fact and in fact Mitch you might you might understand what I'm Talking about by the silver bullet you say you're a Diet Coke drinker but let me tell you this right here I\nI was drinking six to seven diet Cokes a day now remember I was a teacher I was a high school teacher in college professor for twenty two years and I was in between seven classes in six seven classes a day I just I'd pop a silver bullet you know in between\nBy us and and again it would get me to the next class but I'd be dying before the next class was over ready to hit that next one and any great that you don't have to you know we can your immune system and weaken your cardiovascular strengthen weaken your pulmonary strength and you can get rid of all these things\nAre you sure can't talk a little bit that as we come back for the next segment\nOr want to give thanks though the sponsor of our segment here and that is a great runner and the team at Northwestern mutual when it comes to financial planning most poignant financial companies ask what's your salary at Northwestern mutual they ask what's your story and you know building right financial plan means looking at more than money that's why they start by asking the right questions\nListening to what matters most to you and God and you every step of the way to help you live the life that you want now in years from now\nAnd and and muscle contains more water than fat does if you think about a muscle can contain up to about Seventy five percent water\nAnd bones ... can contain up to about twenty two percent water\nA fat interestingly enough or that tissue contains about ten percent of water so again men are going to have a little more water than a hydration than women just because that's part of the way our bodies built with we carry more skeletal muscle and we carry less essential fat\nBut but this is why the ratios are so important and this is why we put you on the ... every time we see you so keep in mind as you're thinking about your ratios as you're thinking about trying to get healthy at a cellular level that both fat and muscle\nContain water and part of their total weight includes that waterway so that's why that's why it's not a good idea just to get on the scale and think about those numbers because it doesn't tell you everything\nAnd this will cause your overall total to be higher than just losing weight so if you're gaining healthy hydration if you're gaining lean muscle and you're losing fat at the same time\nThen your scale may play tricks on you for a little while until it all balances out so don't judge your success on scale way to loan always look at the total picture of what it means to be healthy at a cellular level\nSo that's the big key is that you learn in a won't we one thing we like to do it on the three sixty is we want people to become their own health amongst expert in our transformative week special guest Mitch Owens a Mitch take us back to when you first came a to a seminar just kind of like a\nYou know what made it again remind us what motivated you to come in and then how you are feeling about a seminar and then what your experience with at the seminar as far as the you know you feel pressure was a sales pitch was it something that\nObviously you felt you could do 'cause you signed up but to take us back there and just talk about those things where you were back then when you first signed up\nOkay alliance however they at our ah [noise] about two hundred and eighty pounds or ... really didn't have any energy a slap in August late at our power\nOr are you guys on the radio and I thought that I did so a type that seminar I was very ... that I wrote about what are you guys there was no pressure our heartfelt if it like\nThe vice it out you know and that that you know what they say they do there it will work\nHey Mr you buy or you do you have your cell phone close to you or or or electronic device 'cause he's like a little bit of feedback coming in and I want to make sure people can hear you clearly\nOkay it's bad for the white man as far as I get why right now I might be you know you're\n... you're on the road today yeah I Am out or today okay that's fine ... were row with you\nOK a product of the world right now but anyway uh\nAfter the sales pitch out what I'll [noise] I didn't have to have is that how you got that night at all they want help out my wife about it and um you know it's hard about how I look out you know other vets have up there as far as how do\nYou know it's like it it made healthy it's well worth of antibody or a\nAnd that that's a great point mentioned and you mentioned the word sales pitch to it did you feel like it was sales e or that there was a pressure pitch to to sign up that\nNight out to okay without it out or you know even though pressure it out there\nAnd then when you went home and spoke with your wife you realize that there was a bad 'cause a lot of people ah they they value money but they don't value their health and and ... hand in hand because you've heard me say before your health is you will and so\nAh especially you being in the line of work that you're in as a truck driver I Know we've got hundreds coaches truck drivers on our program and\nOne of the main reasons that they've come to us is because the new CDL requirements than some of the things that insurance companies are forcing our over the road truck drivers in our drivers uh to to be in compliance with one of the things is Nick circumference and so\nAgain it's people's livelihood and now we're talking about not just your health but your actual livelihood so that health and well\nGo hand in hand and so uh you know to talk a little bit about um you know coach candles talk a little bit about he's got a chance to coach is so he's got a little bit more inside but\nTalk to us a little bit about a lot of people say particularly our drivers they have to really stay focused because again you got some variables around you that you can't control like people driving and people texting and people talking on the road and you know there's all kinds of stuff that's going on that you know they may get distracted\nTalk a little bit about your your ability to
