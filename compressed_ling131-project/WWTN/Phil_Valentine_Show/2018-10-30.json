ought to know but tend not to marijuana and cute ... increases a user's likelihood to developed psychotic symptoms interesting isn't it\nRecent study place marijuana among the five clearest triggers of schizophrenia out of Ninety eight tablets under consideration the other top triggers a chemical predisposition the experience of traumas a child or adult\nUh also obstetrics complications from experience in utero or less preventable than marijuana use an earlier study conducted over Fifteen Years in Sweden concluded that the risk of developing schizophrenia increase and I get this six times for high level users\nThat's right your risk of developing schizophrenia increases six times if you're a regular user marijuana but even using moderately just eleven to fifty times overall doubles the wrist\nIn a more recent study and for those who started using younger the risk is higher still Fifteen year olds who use marijuana or three times as likely to develop psychotic symptoms and those who started a team\nThey say psychosis usually rears its head during ones late teens or early twenties which happens to be within a couple of years of a typical recreational users first experience with marijuana it's a complex set of mental disorders that covers symptoms like a loose the nation's paranoid delusions\nAll the way the full blown schizophrenia which well sometimes manageable has no known sure\nSo if you're a regular marijuana use or they say you're six times more likely to develop psychotic symptoms and I'm Wondering is that accounting for all of this melt down over Trump they just can't seem to handle it and I think of you know some folks are turning to alcohol and drugs to try to cope with the fact that Trump is an office probably not a good idea\n[noise] now we had the rabbi and this I'm a hold on let me grab a story here so that I can\nI can give you the update on this this is the synagogue grab I'm assuming this is the same guy this is a Jeffrey Myers and Jeffrey Maier is who actually survived\nSaturday's attack by hiding in the bathroom until swat rescued him was on with a Alice in Colorado on CNN\nAnd he says that the Trump the Trump the president any president is always welcome and his synagogue but she tries to I don't know if she tries to go in a bit by asking them a series of questions we got that Luther\nWe've got the okay we got the okay let's play this where it's from CNN Today on\nThe line anyone from what happened there at the chance life beyond the gun\nCultivated cat and what we're struggling with today is ... ... light the match it have President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and kind of care synagogue\nIn the aftermath of the team on him to kind of anti Semitic incidents violence threats have have have gone up fifty seven percent just send a thousand and sixteen you fear that something like that could ever happen to have you felt the rise of anti Semitic incident\nYeah since Trump got in of course so it's all about Trump visited Trump is the biggest fan the Jews have ever had in the White House maybe the biggest fan maybe biggest supporter cheerleader ever\nYeah for some reason the left wing media the which Trump calls the fake news and obviously you can hear from the question she's asking this rabbi\nIs that not fake news and she's trying to leave this guy on into blaming Trump for what happened on Saturday Trump had nothing to do with what happened on Saturday the gunman hated Donald Trump thought he was a global less than a Jew lover who had Jews all in this administration\nAnd that he was the main problem I can assure you if he'd gotten the chance to take a crack at Trump's he would have done it\nSo this anti Semitism certainly has nothing to do with Trump but if we have an anti Semite who's violent and killed eleven people and injured six and a synagogue and is openly hostile towards President Trump\nDoes that not exonerate the president from any of this anti Semitic rhetoric that's coming from the left\nNo they think it just it just bolsters it\nIt's bound to be his problem is bound to be because of Donald Trump when the fact of the matter is anybody who's out there killing Jews and hates Trump can certainly not blame that on Trump I'm not saying can blame it on the left\nYou have to blame it on whoever pulled the trigger\nBut this is only the left has not been able to come to terms with what they will have to blame the people who actually\nCommit the heinous acts they have to find a boogie man on the right to the points\nThat donned the lemon on CNN also had a panel discussion last night talking about this and he was blaming the right and the right wing media and he said this he says I don't see Democrats killing people you don't\nOrlando nightclub shooter what are you kill forty nine people he was a registered Democrat voted in the Democratic primary in twenty sixteen\nThe Bernie Sanders' campaign worker who shot Steve's belief that if he had been a better shot he would probably have killed everybody on the baseball field before he was taken out I'm thinking about this too if Steve skill lease had not been there\nHow many people have died then what I mean by that is the the ... was as being in the leadership of the Republican Party had a security detail attached to him if he hadn't been there practicing that they would have been no security detail attached\nTo that group of congressmen and senators and there's no telling how many people would have died because the guy could have just shot at will until he killed all of them and he was a Bernie Sanders supporter Bernie Sanders' campaign worker does that mean that Bernie Sanders is responsible absolutely not it means that not at all\nWhat it means is we have not cases out there on the right and on the left to do ... things and we need to just leave it at that instead of trying to score political points with it but there's nothing more divisive ... they said that the president is dividing the country and the president goes to the synagogue in Pittsburgh today\nAnd the Democratic governor and the Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh refuse to go while he's there refuse to be seen with um\nHow's that for a show of unity at a time of tragedy\nThese are the folks who are dividing America these are folks who won a matter of fact the Democrats depend on division in order to win races if you'll notice their rhetoric and all of this it's all about how they can stop Donald Trump from making America great again\nAll of the wonderful things he's done they wouldn't want to do they\nWant to undo the tax cuts so that they can start writing checks to poor people to the tune of fifty thousand dollars it sounds great if you're poor\nBut it is a bad policy for the future of America if we're just going to write people checks because they're poor instead of encouraging job growth in the economy so they can actually work and make their own money\nBut if they do that the only Democrats if they do that they're no longer dependent on the government and they don't need to vote Democrat and this is what's scaring the Democrats to death\nScaring the Democrats the death we have an actor out today who's saying there's going to be blood in the streets of the Democrats don't take back the house in the Senate and the November elections is this the threat is this divisive of course it is\nWhat Donald Trump seems to be the problem what exactly is it that Donald Trump is doing to divide America well I don't think he's doing anything he's doing everything you can to unify America\nAnd these people don't want to be unified because division is their best friend unity is their enemy if we're all unified and making America great again\nThen we just continue down this path of more tax cuts more rolling back of regulation\nMore great economy more great economic news more record low unemployment and more record number of jobs coming back to America that's got to be the

proper documentation that they could do to a local flea market store or whatever and by\nOther immigrants Social Security card\nAnd the purpose of that was too so they get tips on for about five hundred dollars and then report their car stolen later on\nBut what we've mostly found out that that was the immigrant will come in and file a zero nine to pin it so they went maybe tax that was kind of a no one class when I started to act on and then we started getting child support letters say in that money was being held her back child or\nWhat's the other person I bought the documents from\nYou know old backed out the taxes and then the immigrant what quit usually about two or three days later once we notify them that their money's going to be withheld us\nIs ... ... or\n...

eat\nAnd typically the state of Ohio for whatever reason the most popular on fraud\nSo what we started doing was looking at the idea they provided and checking the governor and the day that was issued and typically the governor had very tired or you know three elections back so that's going on with the help they'll find that it will not ballot\nWell what happens if somebody is using my Social

one interesting well thanks for your perspective on that Philip art I haven't\nGot one bill in Illinois Europe next what's up bill\nWell my question is is you know the reason why I think Mexico is not in a hurry or out of our country is because there is a parade and I can't remember what it was a were were mentioned one they won't take California Arizona and Texas back\nCalled when we when we can get rid of all the big Henri mountain quest yeah\nYeah so while they're offering jobs and all this other stuff on the curb and stuff I got to be like [laughter] yeah ... and stuff because they want as many of their ... back into our country or that type of person that can or concrete so they can take all of your back\n... well\nIt's not even an opinion is the state in fact I mean there is a recount keeps the movement that's been around since the Eighteen hundreds and they're they're still sure about it and the people don't know the history is they attacked us the Texas fought for their independence SOL I'm old thing they got their independence from Texas then shortly after the petition to become a state\nUh we invited Texas into the union and when that happened Mexico invaded the Texas will at that point they're invading the United states of America so\nThe United states a cavalry drove them all the way back to Mexico City that would have been Nineteen Eighteen forty eight or we buy All right said the ... had a reason to have to take over the entire country we didn't we said look what your beef\nAnd they said you green goes are all in the southwest and you know it's ours and we're going when we think it's ours and they say well we do do something about so we bought it from\nThem and when we I Know\nWe bought out from their price they named the price we bought it from the bad part is bill a year later my hand yeah Eighteen forty nine is when they discovered gold in California [laughter] got hacked off thinking they were had well we had no idea there was goldie until they discovered gold\nAnd the other's middle river was and then ever since then they have launched the recall and keeps the movement to have enough people from Mexico in the southwest to be able

B. Ira see the shooting happened late Saturday Night as the business was getting ready to close a masked man enter the restaurant\nWhen an employee open the door so a father and his son could leave the gunman opened fire inside the restaurant the father shot back at least said the gunman died in exchange the father's suffered non life threatening wounds and gunfire also hit one of his sons\nInvestigators said it's unclear if the gunman intended to Rob the store or a plan to target an employee who work there police of the father wouldn't face charges since the shooting appeared to be in self defense you think McDonald's employee Marcus, Washington told WBRC\nThat he and another worker hid in the freezer when the shooting started he recounted hearing more than a dozen gunshots during the exchange Washington said he was busy making quarter pounders when he heard the first shots\nHe and another worker sought refuge in the freezer in fear the gunman was looking for the Washington set of the man he's my hero because I can only imagine how it would have gone if he wasn't armed or\nWe might not be having this interview right now thinking about that for a second so here again the protocol for an active shooter this McDonalds is to hide in the freezer and wait for the gum when to find who would kill you\nOr fortunately there was a customer who was packing heat and he killed the gun now why wouldn't this be all over national news where you can imagine why wouldn't be\nBecause we had a guy lawfully carrying a firearm who actually stop somebody who may have killed who knows how many people we don't know whether he was there to Rob or whether he was there to kill all the employees\nBut he didn't do either because an armed citizen took him out before it even started\nIn the exchange of gunfire imagine what might happen had he not been there see these are the scenarios that you're talking about\nIn an active shooter thing hiding in a in a freezer is not active shooter protocol\nIs not going to keep you alive there's the freezer obviously is not locks and it's not luck so you don't lock yourself in a freezer so this guy just goes around going from room to room closeted the closet freezer to freezer find some folks in the freezer boom shoot some limited so what is your protocol\nI don't think the synagogue in Pittsburgh I had one and that's the that's the lesson to learn from this we can say oh and here's what they're saying to [noise]\nWe all need to come together to stop this well the only way we're going to come together to stop this is to kill the guy before he kills too many people\nAnd if you're not on board with that then I don't know what else I can do me sitting here in Nashville, Tennessee I Can't do anything it's not anything that I did that caused it but the insinuation is well we need to tamp down the rhetoric\nThe rhetoric had nothing to do with it folks this guy was a nut case who hated Jews any of that enough as a matter of fact\nIf you want to say what put him over the edge it's the fact that Donald Trump had Jews in his administration so if we're going to do something about this maybe maybe Trump should fire all the Jews fires daughter fire his son in law fire all the Jews and the White House is that what you want\nOf course is not what you want\nBecause then you acquiesce to the crazy not out there who want you to do what he wants you to do so it's not our problem it's a problem with people that don't protect themselves QuickTime out one eight hundred six when he fell we're back into [noise]\nWe'll give you all the information you need to start your\nNashville morning news on super talk Ninety nine seven\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nWhat if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little lists sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nSex fund to seven nine six four or five that's F.

which authorities say is because of the I eighty five and its proximity to Atlanta in Charlotte\n... release any further details about the at least I haven't seen it according to this news story\nWe have now ladies and gentlemen the president and I was just talking to our senior research analyst\n... about this about them German shall about this a Trump targeting citizenship stokes pre election migrant fears is going to be Associated Press this is about the birthright citizenship ... basically we're talking about anchor babies\nAnd Trump believes that he can issue an executive order and stop it\nPaul rhino in Congress says this is a nonstarter he ... he doesn't have the authority to do this uh this is something in the constitution and there's nothing you can do about it\nAnd so this fight has been going back and forth for for many years and it's in the constitution so if if it is a constitutional issue the only remedy would be to amend the constitution and that's a long drawn out process and I don't have a problem with that I Would I think it needs to be remedied\nBut here's the deal I already have a solution\nTo this and if the president wants to listen I'll be glad to tell them and I was telling Jerry brought this to some of you folks who have been with me a long time have heard me say this here's the way you deal with the anchor babies let's just say okay\nConstitutionally your child is a citizen of the United states congratulations you just gave birth to a U.S citizen now what you're going to do because you're getting ready to be deported\nBecause you're not a citizen\nJust because you had a child here doesn't mean you get to stay your child can stay or your\nChild can go with you you choose the option if you want to take the child with you fine you take the child you leave the country if you don't want to take the child would you will be glad to put it up for adoption\nAnd people say well that's cruel that cruel they\nCame here to circumvent our laws they broke into the United states and they had a child here if we're going to say their child's a citizen fine but you're not so you're going home\nAnd if you want to take the child with which we would prefer you do then do but if you don't then we're going to put the child up for adoption so none no more of this business of thing you can come across the border and have a child and then you get to stay with a child you're not a citizen you broke in Europe criminal you're\nGoing home and that ends the whole anchor baby problem but that's cruel it's not cruel because they're going to take the baby with him well what are they don't then it's on them but I mean what if they don't if they have\nThe baby here and there are citizens of Mexico Mexico already recognizes their child as a citizen of Mexico as most countries do matter of fact if my wife were pregnant which she hasn't been by the way\nSpeaking of that my oldest son's birthday is today and I don't normally called them out by name because I embarrassed them but I'm going to call them out by name car Valentine happy birthday probably listening on his home or way home from work today so car happy birthday\nI'm so my wife's been pregnant on several occasions obviously\nIf we were traveling in France and she happened to have the child in Paris let's just say it's car what if car motive Susan I we're traveling in Paris\nAnd she had car these many years ago would be a citizen of France no he would be a citizen of the United states and that's what the constitution says to\nWin both parents are citizens of the United states it doesn't matter where your child is born I'll give you a classic example of that John McCain\nThere was some question because he was born in the canal zone he was not born in the United states but he was a citizen because both of his parents were citizens we have military people all over the world you think when their kids are born in a hospital in Bay rude or somewhere that the child is going to be a citizen\nOf Lebanon I don't think so they're going to be a citizen of the United states so that solves the problem\nThese people come over to have anchor babies and the anchor baby means the their anchored into the United states those babies are automatically citizens of Mexico because Mexico recognize that just like every other country does if both parents are citizens of your country in this case Mexico or Guatemala or pick your country\nThen their citizens the baby as a citizen of that country to we just have this strange thing we're only one or two countries in the developed world that do this where we allow you to come here and have a child and you're not a citizen but you get to stay with a child and we called the\nChild a citizen most other countries would never call that child a citizen so problem solved\nAs far as I'm concerned you don't need an executive order you don't even need a constitutional amendment when you tell the parents that when you come over here and have a child the child gets to stay but you don't\nThey'll stop coming and that's not that were ripping babies from others didn't take the child home and the child becomes a citizen to Mexico when they come home matter of fact the child as a citizen Mexico for the second he was born I just don't you know I [laughter] and now people are going why is Trump doing this now\nI asked the very same question today is it to stoke up the base perhaps\nBut will it anger or the other side of the point where they get out and vote on November sick I don't know I don't know that this issues even going to matter to a lot of folks but I Will tell you this\nIs an easily remedy the problem without having to do an executive order or go through the constitutional amendment process all we got to do is kick the parents out and they stopped coming into discussion by the way juicy rats mice and do we have this ongoing [noise]\nWant to make sure we get all this on his show prep cause I tell you that everything we talk was unsure Oprah or we have now\nA new high\nYeah there to we have a new high Trump's support among black voters now at forty\nPercent that's a
