{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "I'm not sure any weather but at least those three so let's recap this is the almost the last Saturday I Believe it's the last thirty of October so\nThat means that um you need to really sit down and do two things one police confirm your W for information if you are married\nAnd you don't have any children and unless you've got a lot of deductions I Would still say claim married and zero not married in three that happens a lot when people are looking at me like a friday I don't understand why not getting a refund or while money every year\nThat would be why you owe money it's because you're getting too much\nOn your paycheck instead of giving a little bit more at the front and you won't have to write checks at the end I'm not big on who's refund I Will tell you if it's five hundred dollars you have to write a check for I consider that pretty good\nUm but if it's five thousand dollars we need to make adjustments also you need to take a look at your retirement accounts just make sure that you're contributing and keep in mind if you were in\nThe um the twelve I think it's like forty five thousand dollars or less a for a married couple and like twenty five or thirty thousand is one of those married penalties and\nThere is a savers credit you get\nSo that's up to and that's still in the book sky so if you're a person that's maybe making just starting out and you have a four O. one K. contribute you can get up to two thousand dollars tax credit it's an awesome and credit we love credits right credit means dollar for dollar deduction\nSo we want to be able to do that instead of looking at your capital gains if you have a situation where maybe you have some stock that you've been wanting to sell maybe the stock market has been pretty good for you and he wanted to clean this one out because you want to do it maybe if you can look at your income it might be a good time to sell some of it I'm not an expert but\nI can tell you my saved some tax dollars again\nLet's recap standard deduction for an individual is twelve thousand dollars a married couple is twenty four if you're over the age of sixty five you can add another sixteen hundred to the single and you can add another Thirteen hundred per person if you're married which would be to people so we should just say twenty six hundred\nUm so you had that we have phased out the personal exemption so we are losing four thousand and fifty dollars on each person's tax returns\nReally really important to make sure you have that\nI'm In the system and that uh the AMC tax alternative minimum tax if you're doing something with that\nYou want to make sure if you're selling real estate's maybe you're in a lower income bracket and you're like oh it should be Fifteen Percent just know that if a anti tax or an alternative minimum tax kicks in that starts at twenty six percent\nThat can be a bit of a shock if you think in Fifteen and you're paying twenty six so you want to you before you sell something place this all happened before before you sell something with your tax person makes sure that you understand which one's going to be the right rate for you and again\nThe capital gains rates are not running exactly with the income tax rates which is again something different we used to have the zero Fifteen and everything in Fifteen Percent but it's about two hundred dollar difference between the Fifteen and the twelve it's not dollar for dollar so no your rates that you have what you have going on there\nA child tax credit this year is going to be two thousand instead of a thousand fourteen hundred that could be refundable so that will help limitations we had a limitation for what we call the salt tax or the state and local\nAs we get to claim sales tax as everyone knows as well as um property taxes\nOn our tax returns and if you have multiple piece of property all the different property taxes are tax deductible but you can only claim up to ten thousand dollars so if you have three or four properties you may be paying ten thousand dollars in property taxes\nUm and that doesn't include the sales tax\nYou're making a couple of hundred thousand that's another four or five thousand dollars in sales tax so you may be Maxine out that particular deduction were in the past\nYou may be able to claim eleven or twelve thousand ten thousand will be the maximum for my people that live in New Jersey and other states that might be listening to heart radio we're just going to be crying come taxis I hate to say because I got people that pay income tax more than ten thousand dollars bad enough the property taxes so\nUm that's just going to be what it is interest on you're a qualified residence\nThat his um if you've purchased it and twenty I'm Eighteen\nIf it's over seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars that mortgage interest is not a tax deduction above that\nIf a if you purchased it in the past we always had the million dollars and the interest above that and they're all start putting the information they come in and say well how do they know how much my mortgages well if you look on your ten Ninety eight it has the dollar amount when the mortgage happened\nAnd uh the name of the property so used to never have that information so they're getting a little smarter so we're going to know what property of ties to\nSo if you have a line of credit that goes to a rental property that interest would go on your schedule eat but if you have a second home and you brought your second home with a line of credit that's going to hurt us because we cannot write off that interest in the new current tax laws\nSo um if if you have a line of credit for a hundred thousand or less than it is tied to your primary home\nYou can write it off if you use it for improvements or to um you know it's sometimes used to be they get a line of credit for part of your down payment and the mortgage\nBut any way you look at it that's really really important again my truckers I Love you guys but you guys with employees they kept W. twos keep in mind you really need to be re evaluating what you're having come out of your paychecks because we're not going to get our per diem\nIs gone at this moment I mean we're all fighting I Know you guys even have unions and stuff in Washington trying to get that back on the books under the miscellaneous deductions but as of right now the per diem under miscellaneous deductions is not available such very very important\nThat you consider that and if you're a person may I have a couple of clients that drive their own car and they're like district managers so they would drive from one store to another store to another store and they'd write off those miles and again that is not something that's gonna be deductible any longer so if you're used to getting maybe Fifteen twelve thousand I've round those numbers\nAre not going to be part of your item I scheduled a and therefore you may not be able to itemize\nAnd of course without that you may be in a higher tax bracket that you're used to being and so really really evaluate your schedule a a um information so you have that I'm In case you have at the charitable contributions I have to say Tennesseans are extremely great give us\nUm and so if you are an individual that does give and maybe maximum out every year which is fifty percent of your a GI it's sixty percent now\nSo you can give a little bit more in for some reason you give a little too much remembered that will roll over to the next year you don't lose it so I had a a gentleman that actually a wrote a check for a million dollars to charity\nI'm totally cool and ah it took about three years to use that up but uh he he did and that was a great thing so I'm just saying if for some reason maybe you've got a piece of art maybe you've got some stop that you really inflated air or deflated or whatever and you want to sell it and there's a value to it there's a way of giving\nThat uh appraised value without having to pay tax on it so it doesn't have to be cold cash it just makes a difference on what you have\nAgain a state exemptions for twenty Eighteen eleven million two hundred thousand married couples twenty two thousand four hundred um Fifteen thousand dollars per person for the gift\nUm if you have something like that and you still have to step up and base so that's one of the reasons if you pass away someone inherit your house is a step up and bases people and that is a huge tax savings for individual\nAll right this has

fly right [laughter] or you're [laughter] you're addicted no not\nQuite [laughter] but um [noise] so\nIf you're not putting up with anything there's no reason to pay you anything now there are a lot of people that would be willing to buy an investment\nThat pays a great return if it doesn't fluctuating value much\nNow a basic economics tells us that if prices\nGo down you know they they'll they'll go down\nWhen there is excess supply so if there's a lot of money out there and people are going man I Love this investment it always goes up it never goes down there will be a lot of money chasing that investment if there's a lot of money chasing that investment\nAnd there's limited need for that money then the price which in this case is return on investment will drop\nInstead stocks will go up and down large percentages in any given month with small variations in other markets so you might have for example you know stocks go up ten percent\nTwo months in a row let's say in January and February they go up\nTen percent the return on your investments going to be what ten percent and then another ten percent nuts can make ten percent off at the end of ten percent so it's going to be eleven percent right so it's about Twenty one percent return because of compounding by let's say it's twenty just keep the numbers simple [noise]\nNow if the market doesn't do anything the rest of the year until December\nThen\nLet me back up let's talk about how the annuity products going to work if you have ten percent one month and it's captive you're you've got a capital three how much of that return you get\nBut that's only on the upside is crap but the downside is not cat\nRight so so you got let's say you get ... percent you get three percent of that right uh-huh now than your mind you get how much down by in or no second month there was another ten percent off so you get it three right I got into a return I sex right on but then the third month that and let them I said look let's say the market to zero for the rest of the year until December\nOkay now December it goes down six what's your return for the ... the euro zero mhm they take away all of the return uh-huh when technically went up Twenty one and then the down six should have brought you back to about Fifteen right [laughter] that doesn't work that way no [laughter] that's bad\nThat's how they get ... explain properly well now if it were if we're explained properly nobody\nBy it\nWho by it\nAnd then the other thing was that what do they do worse than other sources so we're just talking about capital appreciation here where else do they take away your returns these wild wouldn't know what I mean is it from the apartment building a market returned perspective\nEvidence mhm right mhm\nSo this is the way the index works is the index the market goes up and you have capital appreciation that's just one aspect of your returns folks the other aspect of your returns or David ... the company's profits returned back to the shareholders\n\nAnd they have to be careful though because especially those who are who are I'm\nAttending a workshop they have these big big presentation that shows then that that you as in ... for the past ten years mhm okay but it's it's I think the five hundred without the dead the dead yeah and so it is\nIn their illustrations I you know that's that's a good that's a good point that's a good part in Arlene I I think about\nThat dramatic when they do that with the market is I\nDid not even think about that but you're right yeah they actually take away the dividends even in their illustrations but they don't necessarily pointed out to people that's going on\nBecause it's a good picture ... beautiful picture and and especially well it's not so\nGood right now I'm sure because now you've got the S. and P. has done so well now now they're they're having to make sure that they only go back to two thousand three two\nThousand nine which was the dead decade\nWhich is a period of time where some areas the market had phenomenal returns bullets only focus on yes me five hundred 'cause we're trying to sell this product Mm [laughter] oh man polling

you know it's\nNot unusual to get a ten percent downturn in sight of a of a given year ten twenty thirty and this is part of investing it it's you know when we look at markets we see that money doubles every eight to ten years after inflation historically for stocks\nGoing back to the Nineteen twenties whereas it takes well over a hundred years for extent income so we have a ten percent downturn in a given year let's just use that in terms of the doubt right now if if the Dallas at twenty five thousand just use that ... that's a twenty five hundred point moved down to now\nRight so

really calling going I'm worried about the market's really so it's it's not ... not much I think there's a big big benefit of educating investors\nAnd it's ... degrees and I educate you know is is like\nYou're managing their expectation that yeah you do you really do you know and it's one of the things you can you know it's it's like an investment industry was hell so often happens\n[noise] she was telling me going to and there was a big investment firm\nI don't know is handling of four one K. maybe I think it may have been handling for her four oh one K. and and she wanted to go to cash in the four oh one K.\nAnd what I thought was so sad was that the company huge company said okay\nAnd they're just order takers whatever you want we will do you know it's and it's literally there's you know and I says that is something that I Will not do simply because I have to be\nA fiduciary and I'm held too much much higher level than anything that was ever proposed in the laws regarding fiduciary standard you know keeping somebody's best interests first\nBecause if there is something I don't believe it's in your best interest I can not I\nI just I just will not go that\nI Will not do that and because I'm I'm putting myself out for a potential liability if I Do that\nSo if I Believe that going and shifting money over in this the toughest thing to break investors of us market timing because I Want to run away from pain I Want to go toward pleasure\nI Want to run away from what scares me and run toward whatever feels good now markets historically if you look at markets you you'll see that\nYou know I'm not I've shared this with you before but Ninety six percent of gains in the stock market of ... have occurred in less than one percent of trading days\nYou know so I had a couple of days out of years where all the returns come from in the stock market historically markets move very very fast\nAnd information and news that comes up it's really really you got a lot of sort of impact on news on a day to day basis little pieces of news here and there they may drive to the market up one percent are down one percent\nAnd it's no big deal\nYou know you go five hundred point move in in the market is really not that big of a deal that just little moved here and there and it may seem like a lot but it's certainly not [noise] you know back when the Dow was a thousand five hundred points is alive [laughter] but now they're twenty five thousand right now it's it's nothing\nSo what happens though is if you look back through history you'll see days singled days where the market like large us stocks will go up ten percent even Fifteen Percent five percent certainly\nAnd it takes a big piece of news that'll happen if you look at historic markets returns going back from Nineteen twenty six till now\nLarge us stocks of average ten percent you've heard me say this before you take every thirty year period Nineteen twenty six Nineteen fifty five twenty seven fifty six twenty eight fifty seven twenty nine fifty eight you look at all your thirty year periods you'll see that the rate of return within spitting distance of ten percent\nOf the worst about eight and a half percent best about Thirteen but it's by you know somewhere in that neighborhood about ten percent return right so you look at these returns is all within that range now if you look at one year returns it's never that it's never ten percent\nIt's up twenty twenty five it's down five ... and ... percent yeah like what three times three times and all that history ... no actually two times and all of history you know the great depression two thousand and eight but since two thousand eight with a recent people all all remember it right\nBut you know you don't normally see these ranges around\nThat and you know that if you look at it and he said well it may be up in a given day one percent two percent than the next day would be down to present\nAnd it'll range but you'll have a five percent a couple of five percent moves in one year that gives you all of your return for the year I mean think about that couple five percent moves that gives you your average return Phil all year and the rest of the stuff is just noise is I I Would like to put it\nWell that's so he was insane that he's predicting the market will go down the media using a headline like this to get your

that you think you should have or go on vacations like you're saying that your friends are doing so you end up\nOver spending just to keep up with stuff you don't really need\nTo do ... and in reality

well you're always [laughter] it's like come on if you're telling me that ... been doing [laughter]\n[laughter] Oh thanks [laughter]\nThat but you know in in reality what we're looking at here's the situation worse\nBut he is just ill prepared they don't know what to expect next to it was like I was was actually listen to this one gentleman talk about\nPlanning in general and I thought this is such this this stuff is so good you know what is the benefit of planning and he was just talking about how\nYou know part of the benefits of a financial planning is number one organization you know you can get somebody to get more organized with their financial life journey to life in order I get things you know where it's all together you know where it is and you know what everything is and you'll how things work together\nAnd he was talking about you know that he saw the benefit and we certainly see the benefit of accountability\nYou know when somebody commits to something you can help keep them accountable and I thought that was a really great point to and objectivity another part of it you know being able to help people around emotional decisions\nBut when I'm getting to here was part of it was one of the things he said that really hit me and he says pro activity\nAnd the part about that is what he meant was that as a plan or what you do is you help people anticipate financial life transitions and get prepared for that\nAnd I'll never forget one of the classes I took on retirement planning and this guy says be very sensitive to the fact that you are going to be helping people plan for a stage in their life\nThat they have never been through and that his retirement where they are not working and they're not earning a pay check anymore and they are relying on their investment portfolios and they're not in the workforce anymore he says but don't ever forget\nThat you've never been there either\nYou try and and and I thought you know that's very very true and I and I thought about this a lot and I thought but you know isn't it interesting having done this for coming up on Thirty years\nI have clients many clients that have been in that\nIn our in that stage so I can speak vicariously from their situations and what I've seen and what are observed and I think that's one of the benefits of planning and being planners is not only that but we also have a tremendous amount of data on what to expect in retirement\nAnd this is one of those things to expect expect that there is a good shot that may be helpful decline and you're going to have to have this type of care and realizing that this care is not cheap\nYou know Seventy eighty Ninety thousand dollars a year mhm and most people are ill prepared to be living on and this is a woman I Am talking about right here that has an income that is pretty significant I Want to tell you use thirty five hundred four thousand dollars a month\nOkay I think is there any ... you know so that's half of it's not terrible nursing home ... impose used to living but that's when the ... you know about that half\nAnd because of that this is the type of care that can be afford it on a level of income that for most people would be fairly reasonable right\nSo you've got to be prepared for this type of stuff so what do you talk about when you're ... you're talking to people\nYeah and you know what I'm going to cut you off or just a second because I'm just realizing that I'm up against or break\nLet me do this I Want you in the other side of this I guess [laughter] I Want you on the other side of this

about this long term care we're talking about in nursing home\nSporting this stuff and retirement and what do you think there are some of your thoughts were\nWell definitely had some thoughts and it just actually recently having this conversation multiple times\nAnd it it will really came to mind is what an issue of this is for for just a great multitudes of people because you have the people out there that just don't have a lot of savings don't have many assets and they're going to happen really date fake\nWhat they you know have to take and then you have people that have so much money that they can self insure but the great majority of people\nAre in between ... and there are the ones that really need to address this and really consider everything we're talking about and more and have these conversations\nUm you know with us with the long term care professional with their family that type of thing and and talking about policies that how they were price in the past and the problems with the increase in premiums and things like that\nThe outlook doesn't look as bad well they still can definitely go up based on all these things we talked about they are much more likely to be priced broccoli yeah these days are released a lot closer in terms of a more realistic\nUm assumptions about interest rates and the money that they're going to make on the bonds and that type of stuff and also it much better idea of what the claims are going to be and people keeping the policies and all that so\nThat puts it in the position of likely not having such significant increases in payments but it is it's a tough unknown you like to go in\nOne of the great things if if you could just go in and know exactly what you're going to pay overtime and that makes the decision you know a lot easier than if well I Hope it's this and I hope it doesn't go up and that's a real big issue for people especially when you're trying to budget what isn't an insignificant X. men into your you know monetary output\nMhm yeah and I found that you know when I when I've been talking about people they actually expected something like a retention rate of like Ninety five percent one of the one of the courses that I took\nA ... at the American college they actually talked about that they had a retention rate they figured that that many people would hang out of these policies and then when it was like Ninety nine percent of people held on the policies all of a sudden they said now\nThey've got it does seem like it would be that big of a deal but it was a big deal in terms of the amount of claims that they had to pay out and that was problematic and they start raising the premium significantly and from what I understand they're actually pricing them a lot more conservatively today with higher expected payout rates\nAre from what I've been reading on the topic so I think that's you're absolutely right it's it's one of those things that\nI that had to be addressed is finally being addressed the other issue is people are typically buying policies with shorter benefit for years\nAnd they're not necessarily trying to buy a lifetime benefits anymore no you know for\nFor no reason 'cause it's it's five years have been most I see typically yeah it's it's prohibitive to go out and buy a lifetime ban and they don't hardly exist anymore few companies have actually come out with policies and one I can think of\nThat actually has a ten year pay where you pay the premiums ten years down you're done\nAnd that I've always been a pretty big fan of for a long term care it's just pay it you're done if they have a premium increase in the future well it's that's their problem you've paid off your premium and you're done\nI and I think that there's something to be said for that right there what um what about you you are talking about Evan during the break you were talking a little bit about the issue of the quality of care yeah also thoughts regarding that\nUm I I Will say I learned is when the hard way um but we've had family in\nSimilar conditions maybe not quite that squalid but\nPretty tame mhm in early on in my career I talked with two or three clients that were in the same kind of a situation and kind of what gyms talking about I'm speaking as much to the people that have the money to pay for this right as the people that likely end up in a facility that's being funded by medicate okay\nRight right so some of these loyal lovely is long term care facilities that's where their funding comes from\nBut here's here's what we have found is human nature doesn't change mhm and the quality of care that your family member or friend receives nursing home\nIs directly correlated to the amount of involvement family has with that person ... if you are if you're visiting all the time if you're talking to the staff if you're bringing cookies if you I mean just the typical yeah human nature stuff\nYou could be a millionaire and if no you know if the kids never come to visit you're going to be living in those kind of conditions even if you're paying that since you if you're in Medicaid facility in your church groups are always coming over this and that you're going to be in a pretty darn good\nCondition and so I mean to me that's kind of a ray of hope is you do have a lot of control over some of that\nStuff in it and I have clients that are that have been in nursing homes are the ones that right now the other ones have passed away since but I Would go in there and I got to know the staff absolutely and you know it was it was really nice when you saw their family members in there as well\nYeah and and unfortunately ... so it was pretty rare anything man don't get involved over there I\nYou know because and then and that and the other thing is that you know I had somebody from the state of Tennessee on the show and we're just talking about elder abuse in general yeah and that we have an obligation to report this type of stuff\nI you know there was actually a lot of worry years ago that if you report it and if it wasn't true that you could be held liable and and that you were\nYou could actually get in trouble for reporting somebody for something that they didn't do and in soil ing the reputation so to speak something of that nature and she said no not anymore yeah you know if you see something going on you have an obligation to actually report to report this which I think and you won't be held\nLiable if it if we invest in we find out it's not true we need like a hashtags senior me too movement or something you think [laughter]\nWhen you hear about facilities like that did you described and it's heartbreaking yeah and I'm sure they exist but also you know it prompts to the ones that aren't that way for the people that are in that I mean it's tough\nTo care for seniors for Alzheimer's patients for those types of things and for the people that do that in the facilities that are truly caring truly doing good care and stuff like that\nI mean just all the props for those people in those facilities 'cause they are out there to my grandfather was in one for about five years in California and you know\nFor his situation and stuff they treated him very well and they took care of him there was some issues from time to time but because I Kevin was saying my mom would\nFrequently go down and see him my uncle would go in and you had friends that came into the work with and things like that that is something needed to be done it was addressed and that was always address like and what I'm saying because somebody was bringing it up that it might not have if it\nYou know just if somebody was bringing it to anybody's attention because that's the one thing my grandfather wasn't going to bring it to anybody's attention\nAnd it's also it's I don't think about my ... you probably hate me saying this but I'm gonna see anyway\nMy son would do this he would go down and he would go watch football with the guys at the nursing home on Sunday on be fun oh yeah and in reality we can all get involved in that way I you know from an investing standpoint let me just hit something that has been a topic over the past few weeks on and off\nAnd the topic is I've been talking about artificial intelligence and and you know robotics and and so on so forth I think you know we look at this we say that a lot of these expenses are just out of control in nursing home facilities and assisted living facilities\nI think one of the interesting innovations it's going to be coming down the road and you guys know made the eternal optimist I think one of the interesting innovations is robotics and artificial intelligence and helping with care in facilities like this because you think about\nThat I was I was talking to a gentleman this week and he's a business owner runs a swimming pool company and he had the most fascinating story about a a a dairy and\nHe was talking about this dairy and just talk about how the cows moves through and everything was automated you know you wait the cows and and when the cat went in and you knew what it weighed you know we knew what it was supposed to way so if it weighed more when I walked into the barn\nIt was because of the the milk that the cow had right and then you had these laser guided things that\nMilk the cow and a lot I Know many\nI mean it's amazing [laughter] so what would happen then it would it would pull the milk out and then of course what happens is the cows weights going down as the milk coming out right\nYeah so I had a conversation this week with a gentleman and um [noise]\nYou know we we talk about diversification all the time and so we have you know two dozen roughly ... categories in our portfolio and so forth but what do we hear about on the evening news I doubt or are they asked our listeners ... U.S companies sure and so this is a person that uh is way behind the eight ball mhm\nAnd called last week\nHey the US's up acts and we're only up X minus y mhm and so we have this linked linked the conversation while it's 'cause you don't have everything in X here's why we don't want to change performance and so for them\nWell you know the president I think things are going you know this you know these ethnic categories that haven't been doing well they're holding me back and I've got to catch up because I'm sixty eight ... and I don't have that much time to let it grow and I think us is going to be doing what you know\nJust kind of right ... he's a little us stocks are selling ... times what our national are mainly you know nobody can you to do about amazingly he was going into the category that happened to have the best performance over the last eight or ...\n... yeah who knew yeah yeah yeah the endless common mistake that investors are always you know professor rebalancing opportunity you also don't have enough time to make mistakes with\nRight just amount of money right in terms of you know now that you're trying to play anything happening leaning remember remember the late nineties when when this battle is being fought and you're sitting there going no don't do this don't do it and then over the next\nEleven years there is absolutely zero return for a larger with ...\nA diversified portfolio was only making Fifteen but us was making twenty eight you know like oh okay yeah but\nWe don't want to do with that was the late nineties and going forward or are you a way to zero in a negative return correct and diversified was just fine but ... he couldn't stop him chasing\nAnd uh you know it's so that you know ... there's a there's an emotional component it becomes not an intellectual exercise for somebody at that point\nThey they can't think\nRationally and clearly mhm and there is any number of illustrations that frankly in society same thing with you know meet passion crispy cream I don't think rationally and clearly when the red light on that [laughter]\nI Know when you go to our ... I Know that it I don't and I think that's happening with your email [laughter] or how donuts but well you know and so here's this person that's going to make a mistake yeah it has no time to recover from the mistake\nAnd that's just that's a tough thing\nTo see especially when you relate the story of that's where they can end up because they have no assets and now they can't care for themselves we we can see that anticipate that in\nIn this and the ... part is the investing industry they ... they pray on ... they they go and look what's going on look what's happening the media does it\nYou know the media does it because you know there that's that's all they know quite often you know I Would get in they talk about the ... it's only thirty companies it's only thirty companies but you know if you look at the Dow in the S. and P. five hundred I Can't remember what it was I Want to tell you that those thirty companies make up\nOver forty percent\nOver forty per said\nThe U.S in the five hundred thirty companies out of five hundred companies and it makes up a man I Can't remember what it was Jim did the charts\nAnd I I don't remember you know what I'll pull it up for the next I'll I'll pull it off and and and I'll take a look at it in and tell you but\nI but it is it's an it's it's a tremendously high percentage of the S. and P. five hundred and then it's a tremendously high percentage of the entire stock market there there are these total market funds you guys have seen these before\nYou know these these total market funds and you go okay well this this and this holds the entire market right and\nYou go well you know that's diversified isn't it well known those thirty stocks makeup\nHave very high percentage of the total market and what happens if people think they're diversified and they have really no diversification whatsoever right and those companies drop like a rock and just like that [noise]\nAnd you have no warning you look at the stock market drop Seventy three Seventy four and it was and if the fifth yeah exactly\nThat's the big well known company and you're listening to the investor coaching ... dot com is the website for all video and audio\nCooking show super talk nine nine seven to the game [noise]\nYour garage getting so hot it's unbearable remember it's the biggest opening in your home if your garage doors not insulated you're going to be\nThe room above it will be possible\nWorst part is your energy bill will be sky high this is Dan Watkins let my company all four seasons garage doors solve these problems for you while transforming your home and in the envy of your neighborhood one of our gorgeous traditional carriage house garage door please check us out at all four seasons garages dot com slash Nashville\n\nIs your garage getting so hot it's unbearable remember it's the biggest opening your home and if your garage doors not insulated you're going to be in the room above it it will be possible worst part is your energy bill continue to be sky high this is Dan Watkins let my company all four seasons garage doors solve these problems for a\nWhile transforming your home into the envy your neighborhood with one of our gorgeous traditional or carriage house garage doors\nPlease check us out at all four seasons garages dot com slash Nashville\nCentered dot com [noise] let's go inside the mind of a ten year old\nI mean by\nHearing Bobby has this off the hearings when she talks just what you want me to dance McCain Alaska for me not collapse Sarah yeah they can and will be like she's found\nJust like they can tell that Kalanick came to a great name I Wish I was calling to Kayla case like Sandy my class hey why not hitting the bike a lot of\nForget sometimes because he's like the you know\nHe sat school today\nAnd sometimes it can be tough to get to your kid but it's not impossible always make sure they're wearing the seatbelt even short dry remember you have to ... you have the power never give up until they buckled on a message from the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council and let's just say for car got dumped less to buckle up some more information\n\nUp away born in Joplin, Missouri was fascinated by anything with real time are the odds at him going on to fascinated with this talent one and two hundred and sixty thousand\nThe odds of him having Fifteen career NASCAR victory one in one point seven million the odds of the child being diagnosed with autism ... one\nI'm Jeanie McMurray and my niece has autism and learn more at odds is leaving dot org slash signed up to you by autism speaks and the ad council\n\nIs Thursday nights and you're grabbing through race with some friends started off with a pitcher for the safe [noise] which quickly becomes too [noise]\nThe photo of sorry to squeeze in said jeeze [noise]\nFollows naturally by an order of ...
