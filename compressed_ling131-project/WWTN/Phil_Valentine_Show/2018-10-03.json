monologue idea did regarding old white men and why this\nIs something to be hated\nNow a lot of you are listening right now are actually old white men I talked about this yesterday\nAnd being an old white man is almost it feels like an accusation at these days and perhaps myself at the age of fifty could also be accused of being an old white man something to be hated something to be feared and for a lot of folks on the left something to be destroyed\nAnd maybe if you're on the Republican side of the Iowa which I Am I'm a conservative also something to be with scented because our party is considered the party of old white men\nAnd I guess the question that that maybe you're asking yourself as what have we done to deserve this treatment deserve this hatred deserved is fear and an entity that needs to be destroyed and I started thinking about this because\nIt has been rather frustrating over the last several years when this notion of the the old white man needs to be annihilated from society\nBecause I guess I'm One of those guys and for me\nI've been a manager for a long time I've hired and trained and promoted women and minorities throughout my career I've worked hard to find opportunities for women even when I was in my early twenties\nI married in my late twenties I paid a lot of taxes I sent my kids to school like a lot of you I helped them with their homework I coach

to a lease a ...\nEnvironment who she is me either they were married in the ... uh Manhattan\nMarriage bureau in June or she went to McGill University as an undergraduate than she received a joint law degree and NBA from York University I don't know that means that they might know who this woman issues apparently somebody we're supposed to know lows of full letter details an event in which a process to perform the public's sex act\nAnd the letter to Grassley now and this was a a Coons senator Coons making this allegation now says\nLow maintains that he was an eye witness of an event put on by became a fraternity the Kavanaugh was part of during his use of Gayle the events which she has claimed to know multiple other witnesses of included a prostitute performing a public sex act the law does not get more specific than that\nWe can imagine though\nKavanaugh has not yet responded this claim least this writing\nWhat's more low was quick to make clear that he does not know if Kavanaugh was specifically at this event or if it was just put on by the fraternity this is Denise associated with low road I Can't say for certain the judge Kavanaugh was present in the frat house during the event but he was at Yale during the time\nPeriod so [laughter]\nSo if you're on the campus when some of his goes on then you can be on the Supreme Court\nSaid he was attending Yale Law school I suspect he might have attended what what had been a big party in France newly purchased off campus house\nBut it doesn't have any evidence that he was and doesn't have any corroborating witnesses but it's out there and I tell you they get more and more absurd every day and they're going to keep coming in this is just what these people do every single day in the meantime\nIt ain't looking good for Christine Blasey Ford her ex boyfriend says she helped a friend prep for a potential polygraph\nShe said under oath and was asked directly by Rachel Mitchell have you ever help anybody prepare for a polygraph test so apparently Rachel had gotten wind of this beforehand and she says never she says you've never help anybody\nWith a polygraph test never\nI've never done that well as her boyfriend couldn't corroborate this now the woman she said that he says that she was helping says that didn't happen so again we've got a he said she said type thing and if you want to look at it from the standpoint of the cabinet thing we got to he said uh and then they said it didn't happen so who knows who knows\nBut I think if we're going to take her allegations of Kavanaugh seriously than when you take his allegation that she helped somebody with a polygraph test seriously don't we\nI mean he says it happened she said it didn't\nBut she hasn't turned over anything that Grassley and these folks want and Grassley losing his patients he wants the notes from her therapist in twenty twelve all of them she says she can't remember whether she gave the Washington Post or notes or just a summary\nOf the Washington Post quoted her in the article of saying that they were looking at her notes\nNot a summary of the notes from a therapist notes so the Washington Post had somebody would subpoena them to\nThis is evidence in an ongoing investigation by the United States Senate and they deserve to have all the information so they want to know that they also want any video and or audio and or transcripts from the polygraph test\nBecause this woman ... a Ford has said that it was it was so long it was just it was just along for I didn't know is gonna be this difficult in this alone and\nWe're hearing that it was only two questions so what's your lying about that and we need to have two questions were as I've said folks I've taken a polygraph test it ain't two questions it's multiple questions\nI mean you take two or three questions just to get a baseline on somebody to see where they are with things that you know are true are you a woman is\nUh is your name Christine lousy Ford is are you a psychology professor yes do you live in California yes did Brett Kavanaugh salts you yes and then you can start to see if there's any difference\nBut you can't get a polygraph test for two questions\nSo we need to know those two questions were to say your past a polygraph test even in of itself doesn't mean a whole lot but at the same she passed a polygraph test with two questions means absolutely nothing and then if we can find out\nThat she actually did help somebody take a polygraph test that's just one more ally she's been caught and\nNow I'm hearing today to things and let me check my Twitter feed to make sure that uh you know things aren't the things are happening fast and furious Bob Corker told reporters the day that he expects to get the FBI report\nToday today sometime today\nSo if that comes down while we're doing the show today will tell you what we're supposed to not know what's in it but you know how Washington\nIs is like a sieve so this thing is going to be a distributed to a hundred senators and the stamps you think these things are not going to be ... by somebody\nIn what will happen is probably depending on whose licking it they'll leak things that make one side of the other look good or bad so it's going to be hard to tell but we did hear this\nThat the FBI is not an has not interviewed\nChristine Blasey Ford or capital and that the White House said you've already got their testimony under oath you don't need to interview these folks any further and if they're saying that for both of them I don't have a problem with it because all you got to\nDo is ask them the same questions that the Senate ask them under a sworn testimony you're not going to ask them anything else unless there's something new they want to ask him and I think that they should be able to answer them something new but apparently that ship has sailed so the FBI apparently has completed its investigation and is preparing\nThe results for the Senate which we should get some time to date tonight maybe tomorrow morning\nBut I don't know flake responds to Trump's mocking of Christine forward now you know I watched the so called mocking uh my

Clinic dot org\nThat was shown what\nSo easily to develop but Grassley\nHas demanded that a doctor\nLawyer's turnover her therapy notes and the polygraph data whether this video audio transcripts whatever so they can review this\nSo they have shot back this letter to Grassley it's very short near chairman Grassley regarding the documents you've requested in you're literally October second twenty Eighteen\nDr Ford is prepared to provide those documents to the FBI when she's interviewed we have not yet heard from the FBI about scheduling and be with her so in other words we're not going to turn them over unless you interview her by the FBI and the FBI apparently has already concluded as\nTheir investigation it seems like and they're not talk to Kavanaugh or to the doctor for it and the reason being is is that the White House is saying you don't need to talk of the more you got our\nThe testimony you can go over they were asked all these questions are you need to bug these folks again just talked to the witnesses the corroborating stuff and see if you can get the bottom of what's going on\nWell ah well being of what I Would do is again call their bluff send the FBI over and talk to Dr forward and give the documents and see if they come up with a ... well we're not we didn't like the way they question you're so we're not going to give the documents\nAgain this is not a delay tactic you can do this this afternoon I mean you know the FBI still formulating it stuffs in an aging over to Palo Alto and while you're there and check and see if there's a wall between those two doors secrets of duplex now and if that's the case that needs to go into your report and that's something that should be investigated don't you think\nShe said under oath she had to put it in a double door because of her claustrophobia we find that that was another door for Google employees that's lying under oath has nothing to do was claustrophobic it has to do with trying to make some extra money against the zoning laws of Palo Alto we'll see where this ends up\nBut now they think that they run into their running the show as a matter of fact British Hume\nTweeted this out and dance is worth remembering that for all the talk of the FBI supplemental background check the constitution confers authority to advise and consent on the Senate and only the Senate refused to provide information to the committee is striking and it is\nThey're they're stonewalling uh every time you turn around and that's what they're doing to try to believe this thing but I think we need to see the\nPolygraph test what questions were asked was it only to as we've been told if it's not them we can correct the record\nLet's find out what was going on in their notes\nThat she uh she was a with a therapist and all this and and Grassley contention on this is you can't you can't now argue medical privacy when you've made this public and we've now had a a day of hearing was testifying about your therapy notes and then we don't get to see the notes\nI mean you're telling us what you said to the therapist to see what the therapist wrote down as far as what you said you have the notes so you could even go back and\nGet your story straight as to what you told the therapy let's see if your story that you told us matches up with the notes from the therapist I think that's the least we should be able to do here to figure out who's telling the truth\nAnd we're we're going with this as his sits right now is in fact and let me make sure 'cause coming fast and furious and I don't see that the FBI is turned over\nTheir report yet but they're supposed to according to Bob Corker he thought it was going to happen sometime this afternoon\nOpioid thing okay\nAbout a Christine forward about the her lying under oath and you may sound that see that's a little bit\nHarsh but it's true I mean we're finding that she lied about all sorts of stuff so she's learnt about four or five things do you think she might be lying about the whole thing\nI think that case can probably be made but the Senate and the Senate tours will make that case in their own minds on the side and then it's done and then she's she's it relevant after the vote\nI don't see how you campaign between now and November on Christine Blasey Ford you know I mean that\nThing that ship sailed it's done she did what the damage she wanted to do and then if she didn't get her guy if she didn't take capital out like she wanted to take out there she's it relevant at this point and you move on and don't even talk about

on the show for it because I just I had to read the whole thing and I'm trying to figure out where is this going\nAmbrose Evans bridge you know this guy is okay he's a writer and as soon\nAs I get the story here I'm a we may put it up after on them talking about I tell you everything we talk about we put on there but he's saying that I'm Kevin Kevin always on the chin started the when they were investigating\nBill Clinton right and\nA Ambrose Evans Pritchard says that judge Kavanaugh when he wasn't a judge them but when he was on the uh Ken Starr committee that he was obsessed with the Vince Foster death now the interesting part is\nKevin all was concerned because he had seen photographs from the crime scene that showed a bullet hole through the neck\nThe cause of death and I'm not going to re fight the whole Vince Foster thing but if you remember this this is you know he worked in the Clinton Administration and he was found dead at Fort Marcy park and uh they they eventually rooted they self inflicted gunshot wound in his mouth\nWell some of the photographs from the crime scene were lost but somebody kept the copy of one or two of them and they showed what looked like a bullet wound injury to the mic\nWhich would you know\nThere was also a bullet wound to the head which was telling your shop myself in the neck I didn't get the job done so and is your most evident that doesn't make sense it in other words the insinuation is that he was murdered in commit suicide and cabinet was one of those who was vigorously wanting to get to the bottom of that when he was on the Ken Starr committee\nAnd so\nThat's another thing you know people have said he's he's made reference to the Clintons rather get we was on the Ken Starr committee and the Clintons have hated his guts since then he actually interviewed Bill Clinton for some of this stuff too and ask some very pressing questions about his genitalia\nWhich I don't think that's been all been made public either but that's another story so Ambrose says that um when it got down to it there was a guy name a McGill I Can't remember his name was ... it was one of the people that was working on it\nAnd this person was working on the cans darn thing and resigned other protests because they had been told to drop this whole thing about Vince Foster being murdered\nCabin all was one of those was vigorously pursuing this\nAnd they say Ambrose says the cabin or just jumped into line with the rest of them because he didn't want to ruin his career I think that was the gist of it you got to the bottom paragraph well in the process of this and I don't know where the Ambrose was working for Newsmax or whatever but he mentioned Chris Ruddy now Chris Ruddy who's a friend of mine he he runs Newsmax\nA I'd say a friend of mine I don't know we've ever met in person but we email back and forth a thousand times over the years about different stuff and we was first starting out with Newsmax we used to go back and forth a lot last conversations I've had with them as they\nWanted to run a an inconsistent truth on Newsmax TV and so we made a deal do that and uh they rented for a year or so I don't want to run into not anyway so I put in an email to Christ was going to respond and say did you read the Ambrose piece to be mentioned you do you have any idea what the hell he's talking about\nThat's supposed to be the latest\nReason why we can't put a cabin on the Supreme Court is because he went out on the Vince Foster saying\nWell if you're a member of the time and I do at the time I mean those of us who were pursuing the Vince Foster thing oh we were the tinfoil hat people in the rest of it and cabin all probably got to a point where if the higher ups said that we're not going to do this what am I supposed to do you know I mean I've pushed it as far as I can push it\nI can just go outside of Ken Starr and the rest of the investigation they damn it we're going to invest this is a murder and investigate this was a murder\nSo if if he if he folded the tent that's what he's supposed to do he's a subordinate in this investigation he's not running the investigation you press your case about what you want to do you ever seen the movies about the CIA folks like Jack Ryan and all that stuff\nWell they press their point about what they think the higher ups you do in the higher ups make the call and then you do what they say you don't say well I wanted you to do so in that way you would have if everybody that's in an investigation it's either going to go their own path\nThen it would be absolute chaos so I don't know if if Kavanaugh folded the tent after making his case about Vince Foster and didn't get his way that's just the way it is but\nAmbrose things that he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court because of it\nIs kind of weird but that's just that you know the latest weird thing that's coming up\nWith a holiday is fast approaching we're gearing up for Nashville rescue missions

to block this investigation at least on some level Disney\nOr you know and I'm not sure about that I I Do know that he it was it was on orders from the governor's office at the public health or office in go in Pennsylvania was not inspecting abortion clinics because\nGovernor ridge did not want to be seen as anti reproductive rights or ... or and a woman or whatever and so you know I ... that was a that's why they didn't inspect\nAnd you guys covered this very well in the movies so it's a drama the good being came in in a in a Janine Turner I Believe is in their little bit too I'm\nYeah I'm Sarah Jane Mars has really the lead attorney in the movie and she absolutely amazing he gives a terrific rarely really emotionally raw perform it it it it's a great movie I mean I really even though I directed it\n[laughter] I can highly recommend it well\nTell me about you you've you've gotten some pushback from Planned Parenthood at some of these screenings average him\nWell there was a there was a screening that was a scheduled to be in the same hotel at the same time as the Planned Parenthood um annual fundraising event or something and so they didn't really get that screening canceled it was\nYou got it moved they they uh they talked a hotel and to you know canceling the or the gods now screening and and the guy's not screening went on it it went on it a different place\nSo they didn't want you at the same places they were ...\nYeah that would be a real bummer fill\nOne wouldn't it [laughter] well how so you've done the ratings across the country right already on this thing\nYeah yeah we've been in probably twenty five thirty city\nI'm so far and you know the response has been great and really it's a for me is the director it's it's been great to just sort of hear an audience respond to it I've been sitting in a little room you know editing it and showing it to a few friends so it was great to see it to experience what an audience felt when they saw\nAnd you're going to be there tomorrow night right you betcha I'll be in a I'll be in Nashville tomorrow for the screening I'm In Raleigh North Carolina tonight we're going to do one and then a\nCell phone and 'cause we got ... over there so if people are in Raleigh where is this thing tonight\nTonight it's at uh let's see it is that the um AMC theater at fifty five o one Atlantic springs road in Raleigh\nOkay well so people that are in that area can go see it there as well the folks in the national or go see the more like so you're the you're going to do what you and me about this is that after the movie is that right\nYeah after the movie people will be able to ask me questions like why did you do it that way\nReally what were you thinking and why did you use that shot neck I mean I don't understand that\nAnd after you said your head that they'd ever grow back [laughter]\n[laughter] well tell us about because I Want to ask you about you know being an actor in Hollywood and obviously I I say obviously I was saying that you're a a little bit more on the conservative side is that right\nWell yeah salad yes people write me as a yeah\nWhat does that does that hinder your getting gigs in that town\nWhile it may you know there there's certainly a lot of things that go on and I think well why am I not that I'm obviously better than that guy\n[laughter] but now you know it may and then sometimes it helped me and\nI mean I I must say it's never been something that you know if if they don't give you a job they don't call you up and running\nUm but all I can say is you know I get enough work I'm doing fine I don't really I'm not afraid of it any more people know where I stand and if if they don't want to work with me because of that than I probably don't want to work with them and\nWhat have you seen this are gone up a few notches since Trump got an office\n[noise] yeah it's been it's been a lot of ugly are definitely people or people in Hollywood really feel\nA liberated in terms of like speaking out against uh against shop and against people who agree with Trump or whatever but\nLike I said I mean I I I continue to work I I I Know people that are on the left side they know where I stand either they don't want to tangle with me or they don't care to or whatever I mean I I really have not a I have not any experienced any direct\nConfrontations because of my politics\nWill you just made me going on behind the scenes\nIn which you don't I mean this is something that you don't bring this stuff up on the set anyway I mean you know people don't know no no and not\n... that say I think and I've never done that because I think it's unfair I think you know you when especially if you're an actor there's a certain hierarchy on a set and you're you're kind of start blowing off about your opinion there's a lot of people there who may disagree with you but they can't say anything because\nAn actor you know could say that guy's bothering me and that\nPerson is gone you know so it's it's just an unfair situation for actors to start ... about politics on set so I never do that\nYou know I don't blame you so some are like seven o'clock is is that you're gonna feel Valentine dot com there's a logo from the movie guys now that you can click on and get tickets is limited to two and a I don't know where we are as far as the houses concern but I was talking with John Sullivan or emailing back with him and he says we are doing extremely well so I guess we're getting close to the capacity so people need to review these tickets\nYeah and and

great theater they have the you know they have everybody's moving to this deal where they have the big reclining seats and all that and they got all that going on over the Hollywood twenty seven this

Nashville is you folks in Raleigh as he told you the theater there um and you can do as well so it's it's the preview in this thing and a lot of different places that you might remember um the passion of the Christ\nUm Mel Gibson came through and did this so this is what happens when you get pushback from Hollywood as far as distribution is concerned\nAnd I saw a male was I I think he was he blazed the trail with a movie that's been a while ago\nBut I got invited to go to that special screening in in a Mel Gibson was the year and a Ricky Skaggs invited me as a matter of fact and he was there and a bunch of you know a bunch of different people immediately that kind of stuff and um they were going around and showing that movie a different churches like several months we saw it\nI don't know how many months before I came out I mean it wasn't like a week or so it was several months forget it was it was so far in advance that Jesus his eyes were still blue from where we've we mean by that\nWell Jim Comey Zulu play Jesus and the you know they had to go in the electron his blue eyes so they had to go into electronically changes eyes to brown you know so that he would it'd be more authentic and when we saw in his eyes were blue a and so they wouldn't they change that for the movie but Mel Gibson was there\nAnd they showed the movie and it was I remember it was just so ... ... came down to the front and uh took some questions I asked him a question he was very good about that and he knew\nThe amount of right and I think that's when he set up his own distribution company to actually get the movie unseated nothing ended up doing monster business because Hollywood did not want to distribute the movie and so he said screw it I'll sit on my own distribution company and he did\nAnd they did and it became a monster hit and then what happened after that is Hollywood started putting out some movies sort of similar to what they didn't quite hit the mark 'cause the passions of Christ was I mean that was a powerful if you've never seen that movie\nOr you need to see because it is absolutely phenomenal but that's what you have to do in a lot of these movies in Hollywood doesn't want you to see it's really you know it's really sad and we think we live in a free society but we really in many cases don't we got gatekeepers out the year I often tell you about the media bias not what they tell you is where they don't\nSame thing with the movies is not what they show us what they don't\nAnd you have no idea how many great movies are not distributed in that scene because the Hollywood gatekeepers don't want you to see um it's kind of disturbing actually but we're going around the gay tomorrow night in Nashville the regal Hollywood twenty seven my hands on those folks for um\nFor

place of the wire like we used to have\nExcept it doesn't go Bye bye Bye bye Bye bye Bye bye Bye bye Bye bye Bye bye bye And you know coming to\nGrow the thing was wild remember being in the early yes I was wondering how the news room people even with that thing going on that I got out of my money and get it ... it\nIs about how about\nEveryone good great there's just an issue tend to be a [laughter] okay we got an active shooter in Florence South Carolina five law enforcement officer shot and an active shooter incident here we go again folks\nYou know this is that we got a sponsor that does this and I'm not going to mention them because you know it's outside of commercial matter and I don't want to be that guy\nBut I'm just going to tell you if if you don't if you're in charge of people uh then you need to be taking care of your people if if if if you don't have a plan and I you know I'm not telling you to call but I'm telling you\nI have a plan in place at your workplace if\nYou're if you're the c._e._o. or you're the manager or whatever\nYou are of what happens when a shot rings though I mean we got plans for everything what if there's a fire where we all know we do there's a fire get out you know we all are we all you know people do fire drill loses school all the time there needs to be and you need to have an active shooter plan\nBecause I'm thinking right now I mean I Know what I'm going to do I already got a plan I mean I'm you know because you know who knows with me [laughter] it may be inevitable but if I hear shots ring out right now I Know exactly what I'm going to do\nAnd and and you need to ask yourself same question but really it needs to be on the shoulders of the boss\nThey need to be going okay here's what we do here's one thing I learned at the sponsor of I went to they had a big meat up the other night with a bunch of our listeners and one of the things they said and and and this is something I hadn't thought of to do you know where you are in the building\nAre you on the north side the south side are you on the east or west side northeast side do you know where you are because if a shot rings out and you need to call nine one one they're going to ask you where you are in the building\nAnd you're going to go well I'm over by the window I mean you know I'm a I'm a copier I'm I'm In my office I mean ... you don't know you need\nTo be able to tell the police what part of the building you're in when you are calling this is one of those important things\nOr more importantly what part of the building is a shooter in so you need to know the lay out of your building right you need to know if I'm sitting here on the north side then that obviously way over there is this outside the east and west\nSo that if if you hear an active shooter in your building say there's an active shooter on the southwest corner that's where I think they are so debate that gives them a lot of information before they come to the place otherwise as we saw and they were showing videos of this to\nA in Vegas\nYou know the police got there but they were at the opposite end of where the guy was\nAnd so you know ... seconds matter and I'm Talking about you know this damage is done sometimes in Fifteen twenty seconds when this thing and this really you know there's not a whole lot of police can do about that\nBut if the guys running around and you hear in shots in the building you need to be able to say hey he was at the south side of the building I heard him running down the hall towards the north side of the building\nThat way the police when they get there they know about or they have a good idea of where this maniac is but there are a lot of things like that you need to know I'm just wondering if\nYou if you're out there and you're over folks and someone like this does happen and you didn't plan for what are you going to say sorry\nI mean we've had enough of these going on and we got one in Florence South Carolina that we'll be following the rest of this afternoon\nWhat ... who knows you know with with what the protocol was if there was a protocol usually the common denominator is it's a gun free zone I don't want to jump to conclusions on this one in Florence but we'll see but if you whatever it is maniacs get into the building\nAnd maniac start shooting so what are you going to do you need to have a personal plan for what you yourself are going to do for instance if you carry a gun then you need to have a plan of what you're going to do with that gun if you don't you need to get the hell out if you can and that's the most important thing people will linger around and get shot\nYou know they're curious is coming down this whole way don't worry about it becoming it always if you hear shooting in that direction you're going in that direction and you're getting the heck out and when you leave the building ... bag don't run in a straight line don't give them a chance to get a bead on you\nGet out and cut to the right cutting left and get away [noise]\nThis is happening far too often for us not to take the proper precautions\nMessaging written they apply when did it become OK for men to be

fifty five to thirty seven percent of a Democrat David Garcia\nAnd Tennessee voters are backing bill lean\nFifty three percent over a Carl Marx dean thirty six percent of Seventeen point they had the advantage that building has had a debate last night to fourteen percent of those backing Brett is and in the Senate race\nHave defected to support lean the Republican for governor so you actually got Democrats that are coming over in voting for billing\nFox News poll is conducted on the drums and what I'm saying you don't even remember assess the oldest some other things in Africa oh yeah oh yeah that's what I Want to look at it was um where was that they had Trump's popularity and some of these states which I thought was interesting and for some reason to this not showing how long ago saying\nOh yeah yeah here's Trump's job approval so this will give you an indication of how things might go\nIn Arizona right now his job approval is fifty one percent forty seven percent disapprove that's Arizona in Indiana fifty two percent approve forty six percent disapprove in Missouri fifty four percent approve forty five percent disapprove citizen\nCan only help the Republicans in those states if if Trump keeps coming back because he's above\nFifty percent and every one of these states in North Dakota sixty four percent approve of a Trump thirty five percent disapprove and in Tennessee sixty percent approve of Trump's performance thirty nine percent disapprove\nThe habit folks so it's it's you know I'm not saying that it's\nIt's it's going to be a just a wonderful day for the Republicans but some of these things\nI think the most troubling to me from from my standpoint\nIt's gotta be Indiana\nBecause ... is still topping the challenger\nBy fifty for a forty three to forty one now that's not that much I mean he was up but he was up by a more than that were wasn't too for a okay yeah the Republican was up that's what was troubling me the Republican Braun was up forty five forty three now that's flipped\nNow Donnelly the Democrat is a forty three forty one so that's the one Indiana I was saying with Mike Pence being vice president\nAnd what do I say Indiana was as far as Trump's approval is concerned about tell me they have been\n\n[laughter] they don't ... yeah they do at fifty two percent approval for er for Trump so you would think they may be able to pull that I I'm just saying in any of these states where\nDonald Trump was above water they're Republicans certainly has a chance and it would indicate that Trump needs to become an ... a little bit more\nWhat she's doing now I didn't quite understand why it was the Mississippi last night I think if the men that maybe for some house seats or whatever so you know he's ... helping those bugs and

on Twitter whatever uh what else out there oh yeah back to the real important stuff like maybe the news and I'm getting all of it folks we have Trump's lawyers sending a warning to the New York times\nAnd this is the same lawyer who won a multi million dollar libel settlement for millennia\nAnd he's saying you don't want to go there let me just tell you [noise]\nTimes published forty a a report yesterday as Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes se ... riches from his father\nHere's something else I when I listen to report on NPR this morning it was this just despicable and he bragged about how is a self made millionaire in November when\nThis happened in the nineties the dude my the eighties was a multi multi million a year\nI don't know we may have been a billionaire by then so what they said was is that\nUh they they they claim that Trump said he was worth two hundred million dollars and that his father when he died left him another two hundred million dollars okay and they're saying that's like a half that's like five hundred million dollars now it's like a half billion now and go okay All right and we got it All right\nSo he made his first ah two hundred million which is a ... you know half a billion by himself father dies and leaves in the ... well by that time he's established as a self made and I know he came from a rich dad and all that you can't say you know completely different the ground up\nBut you got to understand this too and I think this is completely being ignored of course by the mainstream media\nA lot of that two hundred million dollars at Trump guy from his own man the reason is old man got so riches because Trump was making killer deals in New York truck was part of the the reason his old man got rich now I I Know is old man\nHad money but not like the money that Trump got into\nOh then all of his campaign commercials that isn't the kind that the guy you kind of like [laughter]\nVote for me please leave home from a plane and I found that are about and I found a bank so he's damned if he does damned if he doesn't there's no way he can\nCome out on this cabinet issue and who created that little situation Heller answering the Democrats that you know if he had come out in favor of Kavanaugh\nIn July or whatever then the base would have gone up okay I mean you know I mean he's Trump's Supreme Court nominees qualified I guess he's an okay guy but after the Ford allegation all this other stuff in their mind oh my gosh he's a serial rapist who's on the loose\nAnd we can't possibly live on the Supreme Court so what the heck is brightest thing to do what is Claire McCaskill going to do in Missouri she's already come out saying she's going to vote against this guy if she actually does vote against them that's a state that Trump is above water as far as a job approval rating to\nAnd as we told you the other day according to that I think it was a scout ripple a scalpel forty nine percent means we'll call it half\nHalf the voters say they're less likely now to vote for Claire McCaskill because of her position on Capitol\nAnd if you think they don't have a memory long enough for three weeks I think they're going to be a lot of Republicans reminding them in bombardments of ads on radio and TV three now and then remember Claire McCaskill hates Kavanaugh remember that\nThat's the only going to say half the voters say they are less likely to vote for because of that issue alone\nSo there were the Democrats if they've screwed the boots you folks Peter gonna get mad at me about that anyway [noise]\nAh they have just they played the fool on this thing because now they've made this ... they may be such a polarizing issue that Democrats in these red states can't possibly win with it there's nothing they because if they go for cabin all they lose their bags\nIf they vote against Kavanaugh they lose the majority of people who support the president in that state what are they going to do [laughter]\nOh this is why I Love to do radio was oh my gosh\nI don't want to get too excited I don't want to get to getting we got several weeks ago now but I'm just going man oh man they never thought it was going to turn out this way they have created the issue for November and they had a blue wave\nDid me and they were sitting on top of the world and now look at him oh\nWhy oh [noise]\nWell everyone's focused on the

Paul ... is filled with the ANC than resentment of still fresh highschool memories he portrays Kavanaugh's Boris jock\nHe wasn't like me were wouldn't want to hang out with me\nThe major similarity between the letters neither man witness capital doing anything involving Christine Blasey Ford or the woman who says at a at a high school buddy Nineteen eighty two when she was Fifteen of drunk and Brett Kavanaugh at Seventeen forester onto a bed tried doing dresser and when she tried to screen covered their mouth with his hand\nIn addition both address the question of Kevin O's teenage drinking ruined the critic writes that he heard cabin all talk about drinking but does not see that he ran didn't ever saw Kevin I'll take a drink\nThe good and says he's a supporter he says he never saw Kevin I'll lose control from drinking like was on the question of teens sexual behavior random the critic writes that he heard Kavanaugh talk about it but he has no knowledge of capital actually doing\nIt feeds into supporter says he saw no such activity either\nSo we start with the good news letter dated October first quote\nAnd this is a supporter I attended most of the same social events Brett attended in high school\nAnd many after high school as well I also attended beach week with him in June of Nineteen eighty two I have never seen Brett out of control from drinking alcohol I've never seen bread out of control in any situation where there'd be in the classroom on the football field or on the basketball court or in any social setting\nHe writes that he never heard of such a gathering as the one described by Ford we were tight knit group and I believe that if anything happened like professor for described that would have known about it I never met Christine bluffing and had never heard of her name until mid September of this year\nOn the allegation against Kavanaugh from Deborah Ramirez figuring wrote that he did not attend you don't have no knowledge of it I Can't tell you what ms Ramirez described will be completely out of character of the man that I've known for almost forty years and then on the sweat Nick allegation\nHe writes that we did not socialize with

see it it's hysterical oh yeah they're they're they are\nSo you see it looks like to me I don't it's hard to tell what it is it looks almost like an apron or something but it looks more like it looks burlap be\nIf you're looking at it with me right now you're going in about two minutes and forty four seconds and you'll see there's a toilet beer and then there is something that's I'm hanging from the wall but it's not it up it's not a news I can tell you that\nAnswer two minutes and forty four seconds do we get a hold on a second okay I'm going to make yeah\nAll right now it's up people somewhere where where's the show ... whether it is\nWe had to refresh you go into this video and where is this on the show prep you asked me it is to a three stories now it's a nice says BS NBC reporter blatantly lies about da chess report so if you're looking at this at home don't do this while you're driving\nBut if you bring this video of course you've got to sit through at least the five second commercial which is fine I mean I'm a I'm a capitalist too but once you get the I Want you to go to two minutes and forty four seconds and freeze it\nAnd then they've got these things hanging on the wall and of course BS NBC has put a little graphic below it new says found hanging in cells\nAnd they're not new says there's nothing even resembling a news\nFor the love of Peter Paul and Mary\nWe got there we got children in cages and none of that is in the inspector general report and this is just blatant lying I don't know whether the White House has addressed this or not but somebody needs to address because this guy needs to be fired this is this goes beyond just stretching whatever or you know spinning\nOr whatever are you looking into joining okay you're waiting to get to the commercial yeah and that takes time if you can ... if it if it if you can bypass the commercial\nAnd then you look at this you go to two minutes and forty four seconds and these are the new says\nMatter of fact he's run with them I'm going to screen shot this thing\nAnd put it up there for you will put this on Twitter these are the new says [laughter] the Neuse is a nuisance found hanging it's just\nI mean these people have no shame whatsoever it's obvious what's going on that they're trying to to lie to the American people so that they ah they believe that the oh so what are they doing they hanging illegal aliens now is that what they're doing\nThey're hanging I'm In sales I guess All right if you're following us on Twitter stand by because this is coming out there for you a these\nAre the news is B\nAs in BC was talking about seeing his followers on Twitter and uh-huh uh-huh and I put this up a couple of times a day for the week to make sure that we got it right or if I find this thing that All right ... ... ... ah ha there we go All right\nAs long as that this should be coming to you so if you're following us on Twitter at Valentine show\nCheck that out there the new says Twitter add Valentine show or you may have to scroll down depending on what we've done to the day and when you're listening to this but this year the new says they're talking about and they're not new says\nI don't know exactly what they are they looked like to me\nI don't know if I'd like I said part of it looks like a like a work a print or some of your way around you know that you put tools on what I don't know what they are maybe one of them looked like it may be a bathrobe actually\nBut somebody has not ended up in their in their um room and B. S. N. B. C. says its new says found hanging in the cells are you seeing that Johnny unbelievable\nThat's a news and I'm Talking about that's a news give me a break\nSee when you talk about blatant I've told you that\nA lot of media bias is not what it is is not what they tell you what they don't this is what they tell you this is one of those instances of they're telling you something that it's a complete complete fabrication does that even resemble the news\nAnd you see the little graphic down there and knew says found hanging in cells right there the bottom of the picture on the left this is not even close to being a news it's ridiculous it's ridiculous absolutely ridiculous\nLike that it looks like a dog's a chew toy it does there's some I don't know what it is but it's not a new ... not at all and the the one on the right looks like it may be an a friend or a bathrobe or something but that's not a news either but you got anything hanging and the left wing media media things as racist\nSo anything that's hanging you know well that's just conjuring up visions of lynching is what that is icy moss hanging down and that's free [laughter] what I find that very rice have moss moss says races I mean it's just blatant it's so unbelievable\nBut that's what we're up against folks so I was reading through the d._a. chess report\nAnd what they were saying was is is that uh they said that some of\nThe parents could not be\nReunited with their kids it was like I'm In a handful of them and then when you read further and report you know it's and\nIt's sad because they either didn't speak English or Spanish\nThey didn't they spoken dialect that people could not understand or in most cases they chose not to contact their kids you can't make them contact their kid I Would suspect when they choose not to contact their kids they weren't their kids\nThey came in with somebody else's kids maybe they kidnapped them or a bar on them or whatever\nBut the vast majority of the folks were reunited with their kids but there were some snap booze some snags in the system\nAnd they're trying to fix that\nBut for the most part everything when is it was opposed to remember the inspector general's report or you can tell they say well now we're not here to pass judgment on whether separating families is is appropriate were what why even mentioned that\nThat's exactly what you do when you when you throw that in there that's exactly what you're doing you may not blatantly say it but somebody's right we've probably got an Obama person's still in the ... and the inspector general's office is doing this I don't know we need to find out who the inspector general for the d._a. jets is maybe gives us some\nInsight into how this thing was done but it was just unbelievable blatantly biased from B.

S. M. C. A. or you're saying it's not really that different from NAFTA\nNow with NAFTA the most important thing about it is a near absence of care I'm basically the original NAFTA agreement back in the nineties\nVirtually eliminated all tariffs there a few exceptions are such as Canada's dairy industry for example um there are some automobile regulations as well that service to factor trade barriers um and they renegotiated a U.S Marine Corps gr I mean the United states Mexico Canada agreement\nI'm actually liberalize itself so that it does a good thing um in in that respect but otherwise it's really not much of a change at all just has a new name and a few other minor changes\nRole and now how about the dairy thing I mean that was the big ... there was a big bugaboo three hundred percent on or almost on dairy products coming from the U.S into Canada has that changed\nIt has changed a that's a policy that\nCandidate should have liberal as a long time ago and now because of these negotiations\nAre going to do so unfortunately the U. S. um also has quite a bit of protectionist policies and its own agriculture policies not just in their industry but across the board\nRanging from subsidies to export policies to you name it I'm of course a lot of those or state level so they're not necessarily covered in a federal level agreement like the U.S NCA [noise]\nUm but that's something to the U.S should have done and didn't so there's no change their\nOkay well we're we're we're so where is the change I mean what are we getting for this\n[noise]\nNot much of the big one for consumers is going to be that cars are going to become a little bit more expensive um for cars that are manufactured in Mexico um a certain percentage of workers have to make at least sixteen dollars per hour which is several times higher than what the average Mexican labor meant\nSo car companies have a choice between paying more to make in Mexico or pay more to move those jobs to the U. S. which means disrupting supply chains\nA capital costs real estate costs are so whether they stay in Mexico or move to the U.S cars are going to cost a little bit more and if they stay in Mexico there's also a two and a half percent tariffs so if you're buying a twenty thousand dollar car\nOr you pay an extra five hundred dollars to get not a better car or a fancy car to send cards more expensive\nBut the workers are going to be paying what the ... at least a sixteen dollars an hour at least forty percent of this ring\nYeah but out of consumers pocket so it's not a net gain it's a redistribution\nYeah and I see what you're saying I think what he was trying to get people saying well they're trying to get the wages in the United states I don't know many car places car manufacturers aren't already paying at least sixteen dollars an hour for hopes to manufacture cars I think this was designed to keep so many of the car manufactures from going to Mexico\nWhich just\nA shame because of the average manufacturing wage and the U.S was already about Seventeen dollars and fifty cents [noise] um but if you preserve the manufacturing jobs that prevents workers from moving to jobs in the service sector or pay is actually about a dollar higher on average\nSo for a fulltime job you're talking about two thousand bucks a year and for it to her and her family you're talking about possibly as much as four thousand dollars\nWhen you say though I don't know when you send it prevents them what prevents them from moving to these other jobs", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Phil Valentine Show", "city": "Hendersonville", "day": "03"}
