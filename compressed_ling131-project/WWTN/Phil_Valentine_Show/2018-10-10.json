district attorney's office without additional witnesses but having the best reinstatement might strengthen the case against the driver prosecutors decided to bring one\nThe information provided by those individuals as important\nAnd it would be up to mold to provide the information to the county for their review says spokesman sergeant Christopher burly it is important to note that the video may leave questions they cannot be answer whether the person being president to answer those questions it's obvious what's\nGoing on and the guy drives down the street he drives in ... he drives up on a mob of crazy people and they're beating cars ... and and the and whatever you so they started wailing on his car he's trying to get out of the way these folks because he has no idea what they're going to do\n[noise]\nTo this new legal standard a mob of bugs\nThis is from um the gateway puns ... thugs barely have the right to surround a police car of an officer on duty threaten the officer hit the car with fist in sticks smash up the windows and if the officer tries to escape the situation than he is the one committing crimes while the ... and become the victims are\nThey talking about the incident uh took place a block\nAway from a police central precincts headquarters and not a single uniformed officer was dispatched to quell the unruly mob of course if you're on CNN you can't call them a mob\nOne person managed to get a screen Graham from one of the video showing this brave police officer\nStanding far away from the mayhem refusing to protect and serve he's just um it's a motorcycle copies got his the visor oh the the or whatever it is the shield of his helmet up and he's just watching all of these protesters beat the hell out of the car\nAnd just stands there what is it would I Know Portland supposed to be pretty liberal but uh we got affiliates up they maybe you folks can explain what the hell's going on up there\nYou want to find out what's going on CNN check this out we have a panel ladies and gentlemen let me set the table for you it's done the lemon ... another black man and a black woman and then a token honky and they're talking about Kanye\nWest is what happens when ... says what happens when negroes don't read 'em and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in for a verdict and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures [noise]\nThat's done looking at it and God [laughter] it's like whoa okay [laughter] that's right [laughter]\nCome back and watch the old Chris Rock or the white guys not amused apparently they looked at it you know that All right go ahead and maybe it'll work there I don't know\n[laughter] where in the black and white and black\nFolks aren't that says train Kanye West and the race on draft okay they've had it with had he not\nWell although I Do I Do know that reference I Know that is an old Dave Chappelle skit I Know [laughter] All right good luck on [laughter]\nSeriously I mean this is not the county west of two thousand and you know for this in the college dropout album guy\nSo this is not and what's funny to me to watch all of these\nWhite people behind Donald Trump clapping away at the name of ... when he wasn't that long ago that Kanye West said that George W. Bush doesn't like black people love and care Hurricane Katrina and you know al ... cells but now all of a sudden ... because he put out an ad hats and he's an attention more like the president\nHe's all of a sudden now that that that model spokesperson ... he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has she's already been hospitalized you know I got the trivialize mental health issues but I mean I was really a\nHas taken a turn in a very strange way\nYou read any of his interviews looking to go back and re read his interview with Charlene God it's all over the place so this is not exactly the best representation to bakari white especially on an issue of important as prisoner far there's a lot of other people were much well more well versed on this issue that are serious\nAbout it so ... is what happens when negroes don't read that's former congressman bakari sellers who said then and then this chick or whatever his name is what is your name\nTomorrow whatever name as she says I'm that he's a yet Tara set my or the ... the token negro\nThey're all upset because ... a black guy and he's wearing America had that's basically what it boils down to and so they ridiculed the fact that he suffered from depression normally\nThey would have sympathy for somebody who suffers from depression but now they just to ridicule him for having been hospitalized and all the rest of it I Love ... said in response all this these people say that I'm Out of control I'm Out of their control\nAnd that's really what upsets them there used to controlling black folks\nBlack folks controlling black folks if you get off as a JC watch coined the term the liberal plantation then they started the beach you until you come back\nRidicule you until you're shame coming back on the liberal plantation and they're just some folks out there actually the decided we're not going to do this anymore we're actually think for ourselves\nSee they're trying to pigeon hole ... Kanye can be at once a supporter of Trump and supporter of Colin Kaepernick which he is now I don't agree with him on the Colin Kaepernick thing but I'm not going to tell me how to think and I might go to ridicule him because he doesn't think like me\nJust because he's a black guy and I were to happen to be a black guy and say well I'm not so you're black if I were a black guy I wouldn't ridicule ... it's like I don't say well why is he talking like that he's a he's a liberal he's a white guy\nHe ought to be conservative like the rest of us white problems we can you imagine how racist that would sound what if I started going around with every person who was a white liberal and going what is wrong with him\nHe's supposed to be conservative like the rest of us white folks well then you would say I was racist\nWell why don't you call these folks racist\nThey assumed the ... supposed to be liberal because he's black that's what it boils down to because I'm going to tell you if this were a George Strait wearing a ... hat nobody would say anything about it the fact that it's Kanye is what's got 'em all upset\nAnd I would tell you this if it were Justin Bieber\nWith America had on as a white guy these folks wouldn't be having a panel talking about Justin Bieber is lost his mind they may ridicule him but what really upsets them is we've got some folks are actually thinking for themselves and they're not supposed to do this\nWe've got black unemployment at an all time low ... historic low\nWe gotta Hispanic unemployment historic low Asian unemployment historic low employment across the board lowest it's been since Nineteen sixty nine that's as far back as a lot of folks can remember if they're even alive\nI can remember back further than that I'm just saying\nThe vast majority of folks out there weren't even around in Nineteen sixty nine when is the best job a lot of folks run around in Nineteen sixty nine\nThey look at that as oh my gosh can you imagine somebody born in the nineties what they think of Nineteen sixty nine us as things are so we we're now at unemployment from the dark ages when the earth was cooling off according to a lot of folks I mean they don't even fathom how long ago that was\nReally wasn't that long ago but I don't want to tell them the\nPoint being is we're seeing something historic with his presidency and the problem is the detractors just don't like the way he tweets\nSo I've had a little discussion\nWith some folks some folks I Know I can have a discussion because there's just no purpose and if it it will not end well but\nWhat I say is basically this look around you look around you look at the country the country's back the country's doing well I've even had folks saying you\nKnow I got him to the Trump I mean these tariffs I mean I thought it was gonna destroy the economy my guys were getting really what we wanted with this and why now I disagree with the president on things like the ethanol deal\nI had some guy from the ethanol lobby or whatever from Kentucky I'm offered to come on the show we may have him come on the show I don't think I mean I don't know we'll see how this uh this hum issue plays out I mean we fought this issue over and over again a back and forth my whole point is he can tell me how beneficial ethanol is\nThat's not even the point the point is let the market decide the point

history we're proud of wait a minute you're proud of your history of the Democratic party really\nWell let's go back in and relive some of that history there Eric Democratic Party was the party in favor of slave ring it was the party of the KKK\nIt was the party of Jim Crow laws it was the party of lynchings and\nThat's what your that's what you're proud of you yeah I I saw a bumper sticker one time Democrats loving black folks in Nineteen sixty four\n[laughter] he says we're proud of the future we can create for this country we are not in this just to make a state when we're in this to win\nWell let me ask you this because I think this is a question that needs to be asked of every Democrat out there you want a different different America what about this prosperity don't you like\nYou can start and tell me what what about do you not large let me just go down the list of things that have been accomplished and you tell me what you don't like\nAbout him historic low black unemployment I'll give you five minutes to expound on that subject what don't you like about it then\nOh I Know what you don't like about what'd you don't like them as if you were black people are on government dependence that's what you'll you'll never say is what what what is not like about historic low his Hispanic unemployment or historic low Asian unemployment\nWhat's not to like about unemployment as low as has been since Nineteen sixty nine and what's not like my then\nAnd it's short circuit the free market and people are afraid to let it go\nYou know it was Andrew Jackson's big thing he killed what was essentially the fed back in his day and then they came back in the early Nineteen hundreds and then we got what we got now the creature from Jekyll Island\nBut we need a free economy and when we have a free economy then when people do stupid things then they don't last in a free economy\nBut instead we want to prop up people who do stupid things whether it's car manufacturers or whether it's banks or insurance companies or whatever when they get too big there's no such thing as too big to fail\nYou know I had um I had alone with countrywide they were one of the bad actors out there and I remember what they were doing I mean they were giving loans\nYou know a hundred and ten percent of the home value and things like this I had some buddies who were in the in the mortgage broker business\nAnd I told you I came across I used to well I still do from time to time I keep a journal you know write stuff down and I had gone with them on a trip and this was in two thousand seven I Believe and they were trying to explain to me on the trip about a subprime mortgages\nAnd I said what\nThey said what's it called the subprime mortgage and they were telling me about country why they say countrywide is pushing this stuff when I was all the time they want us to do the subprime mortgages is we don't do it\nAnd and now they're trying to pull some of our business away from us because we won't do sub prime ... cause it's a higher interest rate obviously because you don't have the credit and then you know but they're giving you all the money you want and you have no credit they charge a higher interest rate and they make a killing\nUntil you don't pay which is exactly what happened so these guys saw this coming year or so before it actually hit and they were trying to explain to me what was going on and the problem with countrywide into all these there were too big to fail was they needed ... to a failed a long time ago\nBut I had my I had a um a a a home loan with him so what was going to happen if countrywide just went belly up\nDoes that mean that I just tear up my uh my mortgage note and don't pay any more and I got a house for free\nI don't think so you know what would've happened\nSome other entity some other lending institution would've come in and bought the paper for pennies on the dollar and then they would have called me up and said hey fill this is Bob Bob's mortgage company we now own your mortgage and you've got to start paying us\nI'm not going to just walk away and not have to pay for my house anymore the market would have corrected but no\nWe have to prop folks up\nAnd when you prop folks up they don't learn lessons and here we are right back you see the advertisers all the time we'll give you one hundred percent of your loan value we don't worry about your credit I'm going what the hell are these people do when they're doing exactly what they did before ten years ago we're right back to where

U. I. C.

Michael's wins and dropped as this storm crosses Florida into Georgia meteorologist Jennifer Grey is tracking the storm\nThis category three storm rolling into Georgia as we speak from the south I can assure you that never happened as long as records have been tapped\nThey were trying to save capitalism from itself is what the fed does so they raise interest rates to keep it keep inflation in check supposedly and some of you folks when you don't want to stand economically\nI understand free markets and I know the one I think the uh the fed does\nIs it um I'm trying to think of a good analogy\nIt's like I'm holding onto a rubber band and the going in the wrong direction eventually you got to let it go and it just ... shots and you know even know where no telling where it goes\nIt's you don't it's similar to me what are they trying to New York and other places rent control\nSo they they put their hands on top of the rent and they keep it from going up and they keep them from going and then they can't continue to be more and then they have to live their hand goes and the rent goes through the roof you know and you're going oh my gosh if we just let the market decide this is what\nI Know I'm going to get off on a whole [noise] you know the whole economic\nThing but he is a deal because I hear it around here\nSo because you you got liberals and ... a big city\nWe need to build affordable housing who's ... what the government needs to build ... where these folks supposed to live not here it costs too much to help pick a\nList pick any neighborhood in here around here it's bill made you know it's an old\nEstablish a rich neighborhood always supposed to make that affordable for some folks or does anybody care how much the houses cost and bell mean\nDid you how much they cost them bill me 'cause I don't does the city ... well that Phil what's the point the point is\nIf you can't afford to live in belle mean you don't\nWell what if they can't afford to live anywhere in Nashville then they don't\nWell then what what are we going to do with with the with the with the folks that are of the year the blue collar folks in and they were going to need people the market will decide that that's the whole point is is it's the same principle when it comes to oh my gosh we need to build light rail that we need to build what no we get\nTo a saturation point where it takes two hours to get to work and it fixes itself have you noticed is with the population we told you the story the other day now they're worried about sperm count because they think now the population is going to start to go down dramatically and now they're worried about extinction of the human race\nBecause sperm count as going down by two percent a year they're saying\nWell you know where that is that's nature taking care population\nYou'll see this in the animal kingdom and I know we're technically animals but you see um we've got a farm\nAnd they are deer on it and you would think if we didn't go out there and kill some of the deer then we'd have three thousand here but we don't because nature takes care of it\nThe beer will be as many ... as the land can sustain and then was it where they'll start well some of them will\nAnd then the rest of them all eat and then that's the way nature is well that's the way it is ... that's the way this with everything it's a natural equilibrium and when you're talking about a city in affordable housing\nYou don't the government doesn't need to build affordable housing if you build up and then and only rich people are there and then they can't find somebody to clean their house or to wait on them at a restaurant or whatever the case may be or build something reconstruction then what happens\nWhile the market starts to dictate that and all of a sudden the rent starts going to go down because you know people start moving out\nYou can over billed everywhere what happens is we've seen this I mean I've been around Nashville except for two years in Philadelphia since Nineteen eighty five I've seen this go up and down and I've seen the condos go I remember in the Nineteen eighties uh this was probably ... in eighty eight\nWhen I got here in eighty five they were building condos like you wouldn't believe their condos everywhere everybody got\nCondo condo hey condos everywhere and they were going on and I had a friend that this is back in the day he paid a hundred thousand dollars for his condo which was inexpensive condo back in the day this was in the eighties he moved to LA and what you would have been\nEighty ... eighty eight eighty eight eighty nine he sold the condo for fifty thousand dollars\nBecause the condo market got over saturated and the prices went down what do we want to do have the government come in and prop up the condo owners know\nYou bought a condo was the wrong time you lose your shirt that's just the way it is what what a bail everybody out\nNo quit screw in what the market and that's basically what Trump is saying about the interest rates today the market\nCorrected him it was probably due for a correction because it's been flying high for a while but they're saying that part of it was is that the fed raised interest rates well why is the fed in charge of raising interest rates why don't we let the interest rates\nBeing dictated by the market in other words if I got a bank over here and they want to charge for ... percent interest\nAnd you've got another bank over here and they say I say well we'll do will do three and a half percent interest and you go oh\nMaybe I'll lower reminded three and a half percent and then you get to a point where they can't make money and then that's where the sweet spot is you don't need the fed coming in and I know mortgage rates in the ... they're all different and it's you know different things control different interest rates I get old and\nA mutt oh here's another discussion I'm having my kids you know like I said I got two kids that are out of this and\nUh I said and this is suddenly now till the rest of you folks to this is just an a a lesson that all uncle Phil is learned along the way\nAnd sometimes to trial and error make sure your credit is good because you never know when you're going to need it\nBecause if you want to buy a house and then the interest the difference between ... somebody's got six forty and somebody who's got eight twenty is going to be tremendous and so you'll be able to afford more of a house because the interest rate will be lower same thing when it comes to an automobile you know you want\nSix percent interest do you own twelve percent interest it depends on what your credit is the people that well\nThat's easy for you to stay rich boy\nWell see that's the whole thing credit has nothing to do with wealth\nBecause I Know a lot of rich folks feel horrible credit because they overextend themselves credit is all about not biting off more than you can show\nPaying\nYour notes and paying them on time making sure and this is what I stress in my case said look this is going to be very very valuable thing for you in the future well now we got a lot of folks now this goes back to the whole economy thing and they're going well there's a disproportionate number of people of color who have bad credit\nSo that's not fair well this is exactly how we got no housing market thing they say well it's not fair that they have bad credit whoever it is so we're going to give him a house even though they got bad credit will bad credit shows that you're probably not going to pay it back and guess what they didn't pay it back\nAnd then the whole thing came collapsing around this when you leave the free\nMarket alone and don't monkey with it it works
