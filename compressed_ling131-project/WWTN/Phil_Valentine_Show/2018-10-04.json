{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "[noise] Well Jeff flake is indicating\nOr that or he's going to vote for Kavanaugh so Susan Collins they haven't said for sure at least the last I saw on a minute speed\nAnd so it looks like it may go down party lines with maybe Joe Manchin who knows he may come over what it looks like that when I was going to be confirmed so when is this going to take place well I Wish I knew\nThere saying it may be tomorrow it may be on Saturday but it's going to be soon and he will probably be on the Supreme Court\nBy Monday and then the November campaigning re boots in earnest\nAnd this issue that the Democrats thought they had a lot because they were going to portray Trump as a as a some kind of a woman abuser that Kavanaugh he's putting on the court is a rapist and all this and now\nThe Republicans gave them exactly what they want enough rope to hang themselves they didn't really want that by the way but it won't be FBI investigation but the got it\nAnd so what the FBI investigation and now showing by all accounts even from the Democrats are there's nothing new here they're calling it a cover up they're calling it a conspiracy\nBut there's nothing to Dr for just accusations it is as has been all along she says one thing and everybody else she says that can cooperate it says they weren't\nThere\nEven one of our good friends not only what she not beer she says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh before but I Believe Dr Ford how in the world could you believe this woman if she says you were there and you want\nAnd that you knew Brett Kavanaugh and you didn't but this is how ... you know she's not gonna lie under oath apparently for fear that she may have to go to jail for it\nSo is this thing over as far as Dr Ford is concerned I Would think it is and delete after the election but it seems to me that they're still trying to gather some information from the polygraph from the notes from the therapist and other things to see if Dr Ford was not pulling a fast one on them\nAnd there may be charges I doubt it but there could be it certainly not going to happen before the election I wouldn't thing\nThen we'll see the other question too and I've been asking the bass\nAnd our senior research analysts and other people do you think the Democrats have learned their lesson dancers now\nBecause this is what they do it is the politics of personal destruction because\nWhen you can't win that election and you can't get an impeachment then what do you do you do this guy is a this what happened and the Senate was deem more refined the senatorial version of screaming at people in a restaurant that's what that was making\nAll sorts of wild accusations you've seen the guy we had a\nA video of him yesterday the round kicks the pro life activist and kicks or in the head\nI mean this is what we're dealing with out there and I've told you since the election you folks say well these folks gonna come down no they're gonna get worse and worse and worse the further they get away from any semblance of power the more desperate they become\nAnd with all the great news coming out of the economy and there's more great news today even it's almost every day we're seeing more great news coming about the economy and people vote with their pocket but they're going ... why would I Want to change all this\nSo am I sure that it's going to go well for the Republicans in November no nobody's sure of anything I'm certainly hopeful\nAnd all indications are is that the Democrats have given the Republicans another issue not just the economy but now the character assassination of a perfectly good man perfectly qualified to be on the Supreme Court that they tried to dragged through\nThe mud and it backfired on him and this is why I Want to be FBI investigation because now what does America talking about\nWell the FBI has put their stamp ... approval on this thing what the ... Senate Judiciary committee said all along about ... corroborating evidence is what exactly\nThe FBI is found them so that carries weight and a lot of people's minds and I see is what I hear from some ... those things are Democrats well nothing's gonna change them nothing's going to change them you're going to have a certain percentage of people who will votes no matter what on either side\nWhat you're worried about the election are the swing voters the folks who tend to go back and forth and there's about twenty percent of the electric that does this they go back and forth and you can see it\nBecause some years we have a Democrat winning the presidency some years wherever Republican winning the presidency and so people swing back and forth on various issues you're gonna have the right infringed on the right you have the left infringed on the left and then you're going to have those who need to be convinced\nWho were in the middle and aren't really political and this is the issue\nAnd I'm not even sure that the Democrats were going after that that middle I thing where they were trying to do is stoke up the left and what they've done is they've awakened the sleeping giant on the right the people on the riders so P. O. the\nAnd the Democrats right now for what they tried to do to breath capital that I think they're going to come out and vote in droves and that may not have been the case two or three weeks ago\nCan you imagine if they had done this in July trying to keep Cavanaugh from being on the court either failed her succeeded than would have moved past the ... August and then this wouldn't even be an issue going into November but here we are just a few weeks in front of the election and it's going to be on everybody's mind\nBecause the Republicans have any sense at all or\nThey're going to make this part of their platform going forward in the mid term elections\nBecause you look at the majority of the American people sixty percent according to the Harris Poll says [noise]\nIf the FBI report comes back with nothing new then cabin or should be on the courts so if you're voting against capital if not because you think he's not qualified it's because you're a political hack\nLindsey Graham has a lot of moral high ground to stand on right now you may not agree and I may not agree with some of the things that Lindsey Graham was voted for has supported but that guy who voted for both ... Obama's\nSupreme Court nominees because he thinks that the president gets to choose who was on the Supreme Court when he or she is an office\nAnd given anything other than disqualifying characteristics as far as not being able to do the job\nYou're hard pressed the vote against somebody\nNow I Would say ... disqualification to me if somebody like Ruth Bader Ginsburg who says that she looks a world court decisions infringe courts and all the rest of it and you can point to that and say hey\nShe stood there and you're going to ask somebody like ... or if there's ever a democratic presidents and God Forbid and they put a nominee up you can say look\nRuth Bader Ginsburg has said that she looks at world court decisions would you look at world court decisions when it comes to deciding something before you record and if they say yes you're immediately disqualified\nNot ... partisan thing that's trying to keep crazy activist off the court and I would say the same thing goes for the right if you've got somebody on the ride and they tell you anything other than I'm looking at the constitution when I make a decision on the Supreme Court they don't have any business being on it\nIf they're looking at what some other courts said or what the hey ... or whatever\nThen they don't need to be or if they say well you know I Know what the constitution says but I really feel personally this needs to be changed I Believe we can do that on the Supreme Court and I don't care whether you're on the right of the list you're disqualified\nYour job is to sit on the Supreme Court and judge each case that comes before you based on the law and which is based on the constitution and if you can do that you have no business being there I don't care whether you're conservative or liberal\nSo rich capital obviously passes all those tests and this is what they say they say he's ... partisan conservative Bob and Bob ... he's ... constitutionalist he doesn't care about anything but the constitution\nAnd we saw and this week that we\nGot because the FBI investigation more outlandish claims throwing ice are you kidding me so you're not going to be on the Supreme Court cause you ... through ice it's somebody\nAnd I think the American people looked ... listen and went and the shaking their heads going this is ridiculous even some Democrats out there going this is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous\nI'm just looking ... the news feeds here to ah rationally says no handles misconduct and happy ... report\nAnd\nSaid this ... everything she says it's uncorroborated says these uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocal early and repeatedly rejected\nBy drugs capital and neither the Senate Judiciary committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations this investigation found no hint of misconduct\n\nSo Amy Schumer spotted protesting and the Senate office building tells ... she's willing to get arrested\n[noise] maybe maybe she should be\nGet maximum security lights at your local cops go I'm Josh ... traffic every ten minutes every morning on super talked Ninety nine\nOne of the things that's running as I Want to enjoy the rent but I never made it very far because the arch it that makes me just tell me when I got to the end of my route and I said I have to do something to get rid of the pain on a couple of people recommended against ... start to me I Love how can go in and get a free press eyes are supporting Fannie Mae put that time at\nEffort into helping you find the right arch parts for and you can walk around the ... in your shoes and trying out before you purchase know after I got my art supports\nThe arches that makes ... an ... instantly literally instantly went away [noise] so if you have to go\nFind it gets the store and go and there is an answer simple solution that won't get rid of all around them and that's my that's the story\nSee how good the public supports work for you before you buy with a free sitting intense wrong at the good seats door ...

George appreciate it [noise]\nIt's gonna be interesting to see to how this whole thing plays out of the way I'm well you know you can't read the tea leaves I'm at this point but I Would think\nThat if they call for a vote they go to Davos was on the other day I've been around politics in the long in the middle of this you don't call for the vote unless you've got to vote so if Mitch McConnell doesn't have the vote he will leave the thing open\nAnd if he's got the votes will say we're voting tomorrow we're both in Saturday or whatever and they'll set a time certain and then people will come in and vote because they know they got the votes so right now we're still waiting on Joe mansion we know Heidi Heitkamp\nIs out so she she's already decided as far as I can tell being down ... points in the polls you know four and a half weeks before the election she's sitting there thinking this is a mountain biking ...\nSo what am I going to do much to try to salvage this by um by my voting for Kavanaugh in hacking off my base in Washington DC\nAnd may be may be keeping my sink or am I just going to cut back and say screw it I Want a good gig in Washington DC and if I vote for cabinet I'll never get one that's what I Will be remembered for so I Want to go work for the kids so by more for the cats I've got to vote against this kid\nUh that's what I think she's doing I think she um I think she wants you know she's looking at post Senate and uh so it tells me she's she's waving the white flag\nAnd um it depends on what the other ones think as far as their own chances Joe Manchin I haven't seen the ... the up and I think he's up I mean he's an income but but he's also in a very red state but this could be the thing that tipped it over to his opponent I don't know so he's probably thinking\nI'm not going to tell anybody in the last minute and we'll vote I'm On a boat\nAnd I would assume maybe what happens when you assume I Would assume Joe Manchin votes for Kavanaugh\nNow Jeff Flake and Susan Collins today didn't saying how they were going to vote but there were indicating that they didn't see anything new in the reports and Jeff Flake was completely one eighty from what he was in the other day about I we don't need this guy with his temperament he was just saying you know\nI didn't see anything that would disqualify him and blah blah blah blah blah so maybe Jeff Flake is going to vote for him so that would put them at fifty two if Joe mansion\nAnd who knows what Claire McCaskill is going to do I hope she votes against the guy because her opponent now is up to point latest poll I saw I saw and if she votes against Kavanaugh that maybe the into her to\nA maybe she she and Heidi you're going to be a probably fighting over the same

no comes from it's a British Influence because obviously you're on the east coast and that's a holdover from when you know the British we were under the form of those red ... so\nThat's where they are going to be ashamed of it I mean I grew up with the same thing it's funny because we were going I had I kept a journal when I was in high school I guess\nAnd some of the things that I was writing were

the most you know like a lot either but a lot of people say that and I said that obviously when growing up in North Carolina got into broadcasting and you have to ... some of this up but um I mean that there's anything wrong with it but you know for the radio type stuff\nAnd you know you write good and I remember a lot of stuff I used to say those don't see any more can't\nInstead of can't you
