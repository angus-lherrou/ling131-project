three days before the election\nThey can say a lot of stuff that doesn't get checked and doesn't get countered by the Republicans because they don't have the money to counter it I mean they're looking at a deficit of ... you know over three hundred million dollars to combat some of this stuff so I don't know what to tell you\nYou keep your fingers crossed and vote you get out the vote that is going to be the key and it always is and we tell people this every year every election year and then what happens is is the folks who get their folks out they win and the folks who didn't get their folks out lose it is clear is that and I don't know why people don't understand is\nI understand this I votes are a lot of you folks vote most of the people who are tuned into this radio show vote whether you're on the rider on the left because you're engaged in this kind of stuff but there are a lot of folks out there who are just not engage and they don't care and sometimes you just can't make them care\nThe Democrats thought that they had their issue with Trump and then the Kavanaugh thing came along and sort of blew that out of the water I saw a poll was it yesterday or whatever or analysis or something\nAnd they were saying that the Kavanaugh thing does not help the Democrats at all and could marginally helped the Republicans so if that's the case and it's that close then cabin or could be the deciding factor in speaking of cabinet all\nWe now have ladies and gentlemen to people or one person a New Yorker who is arrested for murder threats against two senators who voted for the cabin all confirmation uh at this writing when I saw this this afternoon they had not identified the senators who had been threatened\nBut the man is it in a fight is Seventy four year old Ronald ... see a Smithtown New York he left more than ten threatening voice mails where the offices of two senators who were not identified according to the U.S attorney's office for the eastern district of New York\nThe messages were related to Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and according to the Justice Department the receipt\nLeft the voice mails with the goal of discouraging the senators from backing\nKavanaugh's confirmation in one message left for the first senator on September twenty seventh he allegedly threatened to shoot the senator if he voted for Kavanaugh or the caller said it's a nine millimeter\nSide of your ... skull you scum bags mother ever\nSounds like a nice guy doesn't\nEnd at the end of the call the man said yeah Cavanaugh I don't think so\nSame send or receive a second voice mail to a district office later that day says we're tired of this guy sucking taxpayers' money getting of a F ing free ride\nSo you got to be real careful I almost said something there [laughter] how many more years you're going to do it none he's a dead man nine millimeter side of the F ing head if Kavanaugh gets in he's dead F ing meat\nActually even if Kavanaugh doesn't get and he's dead asking me nine millimeter signed them head you F ing old bastard\nHe left multiple messages with the second senators office in Washington According to the justice Justice Department saying you eh thing too he's real fun the F word isn't it [noise] you ... you better pray this guy doesn't get in the\nU. S. ing moron you a whole you son of a B arch hey maybe you should go back to your home state they redacted that 'cause they don't want anybody to know who these senators are\nBut thanks for sending us your address that does help I think you will be in touch see you soon see you soon\nHe allegedly called the senator's office multiple times more but he didn't leave messages federal law enforcement was unable was able to identify the reef in part through a phone and bank records he was arrested today scheduled to appear in federal court or was this afternoon I'm presuming that's already happened\nUs attorney Richard Donahue\nSaid misstatement representative democracy cannot work if elected officials are threatened with death simply for doing their jobs the first amendment the pinnacle of American achievement\nProtects debate disagreement and dissent not death threats we and all those dedicated to the rule of law will not tolerate the use of violence and threats of violence and an attempt to prevail and political disputes\nSo I don't know who he called but he called two senators and left that kind of trash on there and now this guy and he big trouble wonder what's gonna happen to them I couldn't tell you the Russian woman charged today as we're finding out more about her her name was Alina a alec seem now\nCushy and nova\nShe worked for the same Russian social media troll farm that was indicted in February by Robert Mueller\nThe complained accuses serve helping to control the finances of a Russian effort to use fake social media postings to so anger and division among American vote is what they don't tell you\nUntil way down in the story is that the Justice Department disclosed the criminal complaint soon after U.S intelligence agency said in a joint statement that they were concerned about efforts by Russia China an Iran to influence us voters in policy in the upcoming midterm election and on into twenty twenty\nSo this is a concerted effort by our enemies out there to so chaos amongst all of us and let me tell you they're doing a heck of a job aren't they now I don't know I oh I Do know it's not just the Russians and\nThe Chinese and the Iranian sewing discontent that's causing discontent in this country there is truth discontent because of Donald Trump and it's not his fault it's their fault you know I didn't vote for a Morocco Obama twice I didn't vote for him but I didn't lose my mind over it\nYou know when he got elected the first time okay and then when he got\nRe elected the second time and I really thought that we had a good shot at that time well okay we move on you continue to be the loyal opposition but you don't lose your mind and scream and show how many of you it would have occurred to you\nTo follow some congressman or some cabinet member of the Obama administration and scream at them in a restaurant and drive them out of public view\nIt never would occur to me to do that now there is a video going around a day of Nancy Pelosi going somewhere and she's entering through some back entrance and some Yahoo's are out there screaming you F in trainer and all this other stuff and they're supposedly right wing folks they said they are the\nWhat is that the ah one of those boys that that group whatever that group is any way I Can't remember but whenever they they claim that they are part of that group and of course the\nFolks at the Southern Poverty Law Center have labeled them hate speakers and hey grew I don't know I mean they could be I don't know anything about these folks\nAre but just because the Southern Poverty Law Center says there hate group doesn't make them so they said I was a hate speaker for crying out loud because I was against illegal immigration but\nAs I said on Twitter today I said look as a conservative I'm willing to say that this is a mob these folks were Monday was screaming profanity and Nancy that's not the way to conduct yourself folks\nAnd if you're really a conservative you really wanting to influence people don't act like they had\nAll that does is turn people off it it it serves no useful purpose what do you expect to accomplish by screaming Nancy you ever been trained her if she's going into some entrance somewhere\nI can understand standing up there and protesting against Nancy Pelosi but then gathering around her and screaming and spending like you've lost your mind you look like these left these out there that have lost their mind you look crazy\nSo I Am calling this a mob too and I can guarantee you I don't watch CNN I certainly don't watch 'em on I'm On the radio\nThey probably got this story cycling every five minutes talking about the right wing mob well they wouldn't call the left wing mob mob they wouldn't even use the N word and that's what they called it\nLook a mom is a mob and if you're conducting yourself in this way it doesn't matter whether you're on the right or the left you are and then you're an

I. L. left us of public interest legal foundation\nSays this is how the Texas Democratic party is inviting foreign influence\nAn election and the federal election cycle the Texas secretary of state's office said it too had gotten complaints from both immigrants and from relatives of dead people who said they got mailings asking them to register Texas Governor Greg Abbott vowed to investigate he says if true\nThere will be serious consequences\nSo now we have a Russian woman charged with meddling in the election not twenty sixteen\nTwenty eight team a Russian woman today has been charged with interfering in American elections including next month's midterms through a vast social media effort aimed at trying to sway American public opinions\nThis according to the Associated Press it's believed to be the first federal case alleging Russian interference in this year's elections\nAnd remember what they've been saying to\nCurse in a a Nielsen DHL secretary has said that the Chinese are trying to influence the election to who do you think they're trying to improve their trying to influence people to vote against the Republicans of course of course\nJustice Department of slows the criminal complaint soon after U.S intelligence agencies setting a joint statement that\nThey were concerned about efforts by Russia China and Iran to influence us voters and policy this complaint says the woman\nAlina Alex ... ... nova\nWorked for the same Russians social media troll farm that was indicted in February by Robert Mueller\nThe complained accuses her of helping to control the finances of a Russian effort to use fake social media postings this oh anger and division among American voters now what they're doing in many cases\nIs it taking both sides of the issue so why are they doing this I've done a lot of studying on it I've done a lot of studying on this issue and it seems to me that the Russians are trying to\nDiminish our influence in Europe\nAnd if they can so discontent amongst us and create chaos in America it takes our eye off the ball about what they're trying to do in the European Union which is to control those folks with oil and gas and everything else they want to do and have their way with the European Union\nYou know they've already made deals with Russia signed deals are not even supposed to be making NATO countries are not supposed to be doing that but they're doing it any way same thing with Iran and we're trying to keep people from dealing with Iran they're going to deal with Iran anyway in Iran China and Russia are trying to screw with our elections again\nAnd we'll see what happens we'll see what happens\nEarlier the AP reported that um the U.S intelligence officials say they're concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia China in Iran but here's the interesting thing to their only focusing on Russia you know why because of the Mueller investigation ending\nI guess the insinuation is as if that Russia is meddling is bound to be involving Trump and they're involved in meddling in the elections to its Russia it's China and its Iran\nAnd they don't say who's the bigger culprit but I can almost guarantee you're China's the biggest culprit but they don't emphasize that they mentioned it several paragraphs down\nIn a joint statement the office of the director of national intelligence the homeland security department the Justice Department or the FBI said they're worried about activities that seek to influence voter perceptions and decision making and the twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty elections\nThe agency the ongoing campaigns could take many forms examples include attempts to influence voters through social media sponsoring content an English language media such as Russia an outlet our team\nAre ceding this information through sympathetic spokespersons regarding political candidates in disseminating foreign propaganda\nIntelligence official said last year that Russia sought to influence the twenty sixth in presidential election through similar means what they don't tell you is that they were going on both sides you had pro Bernie stuff anti Bernie stuff pro Hillary stuff anti Hillary stuff pro Trump stuff anti Trump stuff\nAnytime there's black lives matter involved in something with the police there in the middle of that too on social media anytime there's a secession movement in California or Texas they're on both sides of that any winter and they can drive a wedge between America and that's what they're doing\nAnd the idea is to get us at each other's throats so that we take the eye off the ball on foreign matters they're trying to have their way around the world and they think that if they make us totally discombobulated over here in the United states that we will be weak and\nSo this is a concerted effort on the part of China or Iran and Russia to just screw with us\nAnd if anybody doesn't see this by now this is not Trump and Russia conspiring to win an election this is Russia they don't care who wins what I say they don't care who wins I think they would rather not have Trump and they're certainly after he's gotten in\nA but they want to so discontent they want us at each other's throats and it's working you look around the country we're at each other's throats about all sorts of stuff\nAnd a lot of stuff that really doesn't matter you don't think that they're involved in all of these mob protest and things like this of course they are we found out during twenty sixteen there was an anti Trump rally\nThat was sponsored as we found out later by some Russian troll group on Facebook and they weren't even at the rally they just encourage other people to show up so people showed up anti Trump votes waving signs spit and screaming and having to make time this is what they do\nSo this is just the latest example and it's not just Russia folks Russia Iran and China QuickTime I Will get it from your phone calls in a moment one eight hundred six one
