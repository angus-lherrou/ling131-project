S. is ready by state our staples\nI had I was talking to the host on the phone and she was asking me questions and I was talking to my mind I could I was recording this thing and then I sent them the audio\nAnd ah then\nOn Sunday Morning they sent me an email said we're not going to be able to use the interview where we're going to do some stuff on this shooting at the synagogue and so and so I was talking to my wife about this and I said you know the synagogue thing was a big story but of course they were asking me mainly about\nThe pipe bombs which was also a big story too I think what happened was the host\nAnd I've heard her before on NPR she is I mean as far left as a Lulu Garcia Navarro maybe somebody you folks are hurting you know\nAnd so they never told me who is the host was until right before we were going on and said okay you're you're the host the summer the host is growing and then they send the host as Lulu Garcia Navarro and I said great I mean I've heard this chick before [laughter]\nAnd she was nice enough but she tried to ambush which I think you know obviously she knew about the show 'cause they've done research because they asked me about a gas they ask you about James O'Keefe and uh they started going through you know trying to tripped me up and they just couldn't\nI'll let you and so I got my side of it and ongoing well heck I'll let you hear now you're not going to hear I'll tell you\nWhat she was asking the question she was asking\n'em and then you can hear my response to it and and when I stop hesitated steps when she's breaking in and you can hear her but she's breaking in and you know trying to interrupt me and so when I'm sound like I'm stuttering it's I'm trying to talk over her or you know trying to get my point through\nSo the first thing they asked me was that all this rhetoric from Trump in and you know oh is that they don't you think he don't you think he and this is abiding\nOne number one is that right yeah it's a ... number one says button OK and says don't you think he uh he's responsible\nFor all of this well I think the way he deals with the folks that are on the other side and then you've got to understand that people attack him first I don't know any instance where Donald Trump is actually lashed out at somebody on the first it's usually a reaction\nA but when it comes to like Bernie Sanders he was saying that Donald Trump in the Republicans\nWere going to kill hundreds of thousands of people I'm up by a by doing away with Obamacare a that certainly would incite somebody whose crazy I'm not saying that Bernie holds any responsibility but I have heard nothing from Donald Trump that would indicate that he's encouraging people to violence\nOr you had Joe Biden the other day saying words mean things and Joe and Joe said Joe says from the podium or you know if if we were in high school I take him out back and beat the hell out of and so I mean he says words mean thing Joe what about those words\nSo I that day and asked me for I don't think we have the the cut but I was talking about it and nobody was using hashtags Bernie shooter when they shot Steve skill lease and civil that's a point and [laughter] and I guess it is so this is the first one is number two says James O'Keefe and um\nThey asked obviously they had done some research so this ... I start to realize what this is all about the thinking okay we got this we got this have seen from from Tennessee you know and he's had James O'Keefe on the in James O'Keefe has this incendiary character\nAnd so you know don't you think that the it's deplorable what James O'Keefe has been doing with these with these undercover videos\nWell I don't think clearly must ... a lot of what he does a I think most of what he does is do the job of the mainstream media is not doing which is uncovering what's going on behind the scenes with ah with some of these people on the left\nUm I I think there's a dereliction of duty on with people on the left of not wanting to find any thing wrong with people that are that they agree with so I think James O'Keefe does great work he's got undercover videos\nOr that have exposed all sorts of things that we would never have known were it not for his undercover work\nAnd go well then she said but but one of his undercover people are posed as a victim and that's just ...\nParable absolutely deplorable that somebody would would pose as a victim when they're not really a victim of sexual harassment sexual assault do you do you condone that kind of activity\nUm I don't I don't know that particular instance I Would say that if you're going undercover you go undercover as who wherever you're going undercover for the sixty minutes used to do it all the time they\nThey send people under covered that had been swindled by different people and they weren't really swindled but they're going undercover to catch the swindlers so you know I mean you play the part when you're going undercover to try to find out what they're doing and I think that's what he's doing so I didn't buy\nYou know I defended James O'Keefe he's been on the show many times and\nYou know if you're going to go I mean this they do this with staying operations from the police all the time you go on to cover as a prostitute but you're not a prostitute\nYou go undercover as a drug dealer but you're not a drug dealer if you're going to go Under Cover you go undercover as somebody that you're trying to catch the other person and that's what exactly James O'Keefe has been doing now the other one that says to the says rhetoric\nUm then she was asking me about all the the rhetoric\nOut there\nYeah and you got Eric Holder who says when when they go low we kick them I mean so you know there's rhetoric on both sides I Do agree that it needs to be tamped down a bit\nBut when people say well he he needs to stop going after the the news media\nAre I think that's when you start to squelch free speech I mean he has a legitimate beef with the news media\nWith a lot of stories that they have gotten completely wrong and I think probably on purpose\nAnd so when he goes after the media and there's some crazy guy out there with pipe bombs it does it means you stop going after the media anymore than it means that anybody on the left you start going after Trump if somebody were to threaten Trump and you know we've had several instances of people breaking into the White House and breaking into the White House ... alone in that area\nAnd nobody says all we gotta we gotta calmed down on the left so nobody will harm the president or they just keep right on going we have Steve ... shot they keep right on going I think if we're going to have some\nA balance here it needs to be that the Republicans and the Democrats need to come to terms on what are the rules of engagement here and I think when you call for violence against somebody that is going up above and beyond what you should be doing\nBut I think on both sides for the most when you've got Maxine Waters calling for handing people in restaurants in gas stations in any where you find them\nI think that's bad rhetoric to so let's start condemning all of them and go\nSo she says well I she says I refer to what we do and and and what he refers to as fake news as the fact based media and then she went on to something else and asked me some other question I just I couldn't let the fact based media go well\nI mean before you go any further on the fact makes medium and Paul Krugman said the markets were plunging after the election and twenty sixteen he had to retract that we had Brian Ross saying that Trump asked Michael Flynn to reach out to the Russians during the election and he had to retract that we had we\nHad the whole CNN where the carpeting well they I think it's more of the mistakes I mean whether they're not with Paul Krugman and certainly not what CNN and the ... story with the Japanese when he was dumping the food in there and they had the video showing that the uh the the ... the prime minister of Japan of just done it just before Trump so he was just following his lead\nThey try to make him look like a buffoon there's a lot of that going on out there in the so called fact based media though I've often said to my show that media bias is not necessarily what they tell you it's what they don't and there's so much being omitted so if you want to know from my standpoint of how we rectify this\nMust still all of it was still the whole story I mean I listen to you guys on NPR from time to time I watch um [noise] CNN from time to time I follow all these people I tried to of course I got my own slant on things because obviously I'm a commentator and not by journalists but you\nWatch Fox News you can watch CNN and you can get the whole story that way I Would love if there was an outlet out there that actually put all of the pieces of the puzzle together so that we can get the full picture\nOkay Mr Valentine thank you so much for your time and that was [laughter]\nSo she was trying to get me to say all sorts of different things that I wouldn't say and I just you know I just couldn't front or with the facts I mean she's told me the fact based media and I laid out you know I have tons of examples if you want to hear him I don't know how long do you wanted to do this interview but you know\nWe got all day I can run down all of them if you want me to and it's just it's ridiculous uh so she ... to me at the end of the day there was they didn't get to meet their you know they were they were going for something where they could make somebody some hick from Nashville\nLook bad and making say something and I just wasn't going to say it you know I they wanted me to run from James okay for start around that I didn't run from James O'Keefe we ... we had James O'Keefe on before anybody would have him on\nWe used to have an aunt who used to come to us before we got real big and now goes to Fox they launched this stuff they used to come to us and we would talk about his videos before the day before they came out or two days before they came out\nAnd we still have him on from time to time but James is busy busy guy\nSo she wanted me to condemn you know James O'Keefe somebody when you give the example of sixty minutes is a perfect analogy sixty minutes was doing investigative journalism and they would go undercover as victims of all sorts of victims of fraud victims of\nYou know ... ... who knows what and you know back in the day especially when Dan Rather was doing sixty minutes oh I remember it was some of the best television I've ever seen some of the best investigative journalism they would find you know car repair shops that we're screwing people oh\nAnd they didn't really have a screwed up car they just went in there and acted like a victim well that's what you do you\nFrom the genesis diamonds WGN

walk by what I'm saying are you on strike and I was [laughter]\nNow I'm going to get to them in a minute so that's sort of what we do we don't you know are the kids anywhere whether they're gone so some you know some you have to do it anyway\nThey all look alike really they all look alike I mean I'm just sitting here thinking I'm just imagining if Trump it said that\nSay he's at a rally and somebody said yeah did you hear what ... what Cory Booker said that oh is Eric Holder all they all look alike can you imagine I mean think about that for a second and saying oh my gosh the news media folks\nOh feed melt down oh ... absolutely melt and I guarantee you you've not heard this one\nPlace in the mainstream media well this is what I'm Talking about what does not go Phil teach you\nMedia bias is not necessarily what they tell you what they don't they're not telling you that they're not telling you that and if Trump it said that they would be not ever stopping telling you that so is there fake news absolutely this is another example the woman on CNN Today saying\nThat Trump is radicalized more people than I says I mean what what a stupid thing to say to start with but this is\nOne of those deals where you're talking about fake news and there's a prime example I mean not a day goes by that\nThe president doesn't have some example\nOf fake news out there so would the synagogue thing and maybe we can get a montage of this too because there are\nMainstream media folks after mainstream media folks have said well this is the president's rhetoric that causes synagogue she and the guy hated Donald Trump he thought Donald Trump was a ... in ... he hated him because he had all these Jews in the White House\nAnd he said Donald Trump's not going to ever do anything about this either Jew lover and do this so I'm going in so he went in and shot and killed eleven folks six people wounded and somehow that's Trump's fault\nSo what's Trump supposed to do because it's his fault he supposed to stop criticizing everybody on the left especially the fake news media well that's not how it works and Trump's not playing the game and you still you hear people from October we hear people from Fox News saying\nWell you know in light of all this he really needs to tamp down the rhetoric tamp down the rhetoric is he saying go shoot up the synagogue is he saying go send a pipe bomb\nTo ah George Soros or Obama no he's criticizing people legitimately and the mainstream media\nIs the biggest target because they're doing it every single day and you notice they don't tamped down the rhetoric about him they talk about he's a he's a racist sees a big ... he's a Nazi he's a bomb on my mom and everything else\nYou don't see them tampered that at all so what I'm trying to tell you is this is not how it works it doesn't work that you get to exploit some idiot or some lunatic out there and then silence the people on the other side that's not how free speech works\nDonald Trump talking about the mainstream media has nothing whatsoever to do\nWith the shooting at a synagogue or a pipe bomb it only has to do with the fact that he's pointing out the fake news media every day and we have example at everyday none of that goes by we don't have an example of these folks stretching the truth ignoring the truth completely fabricating something you're not telling you the whole truth\nAnd as I told you in the summer you folks were listening to the interview with NPR interfering with it and get what they wanted they they wanted the ambush me and they didn't and so I and I told them in the interview I said look you know I I Would love to have some outlet out there that actually gave us the whole story\nAnd I'll tell you Fox News does this sometimes too they they only give you what they want you to know what you know it's sort of it's their slant on things\nWe don't feel you do this no I I comment on stuff now I Will tell you the whole story you know when I find that but sometimes I have to piece it together like a jigsaw puzzle and when you positive but put all the pieces\nTogether you find the truth and the ... and I ... I've called the ride out on this many times when they have gone overboard about someone someone I trying to think of an example right there right now but they have called out a certain person for saying something I've gone well that's not actually the context\nAnd so I gave you the contacts and I say this is not a big deal I remembered that I I don't remember the instance but I remember coming home and everybody was going nuts on on a social media and everything about something somebody said and I said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that's not exactly the full story and I tell you will and some people got mad at me\nFor what you do that because it's not fair it's not it's not honest there's enough legitimate nothing is coming from the left or we can criticize them over that's where I always said about the um birth certificate was with a with Obama\nThat people were just harping on I mean of course seeing the folks at a worldwide daily over and over and over I got so I couldn't go to W. N. B.\nAre any more and I grabbed come back to them a check them from time to time but it was just like every day is every day boom boom writing books about writing articles but he's not as soon as I'm going to look\n\nI don't see any proof they're talking about somebody in the village and send you said when he was born he wasn't mean anything I'm not going to rehash the whole thing some people got mad at me about this what I said was to you is as far as we know\nAnd they need syndrome handle the president's going to Pittsburgh tomorrow to honor the victims and Saturday Pentagon shooting massacre today and a breathing White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the attack an active\nHatred and an ... an emotional statements Sanders says the nation mourns the loss and eleven extraordinary people who were killed in that attack\nIs brought you by buffalo insurance gray us half dot com\nFrom the genesis diamonds Sally beauty in traffic center\nA couple of hotspots working right now ... found for forty at twenty first avenue have an accent working there you are jammed salad back to the forty junction also westbound I twenty forty ... old hickory boulevard out south have an injury action working there's a lot of emergency equipment\nOn the role in that direction I'm Scott Sanders traffic every ten minutes every morning on super ...

responsible for the Sunni gun shooting see synagogues you you that's all you have to do\nTrumping others called migrant care abandoned invasion synagogue shooter wrote I like use the word invaders\nSo apparently he's a Trump guy he hated Trump he hated somebody said Trump was a global isn't a Jew lover because of all the Jews in his administration and his daughter who's a Jew with his son in law but they love so much a Jew he hated him he hated Trump\nI don't know that he liked the Democrats I mean I'm not going to go that far but it sounds like to me that if you ever thought that Donald Trump was an anti Semite this is the day you ought to say we were wrong\nWhen you got the biggest anti Semite and the country who shooting Jews in Pittsburgh any aid Donald Trump because he likes Jews\nBut you you you don't you don't put it past CNN to try to draw some correlation and this is what he refers to I mean this is the second or third thing today from CNN this fake news\nSo what you do is you take a non second quarter and you put it together in one graphic to make it look like Trump is responsible for the synagogue shooting\nThat's what you do when you're the fake news and they're wondering why keep what you need to stop calling us that because it's inciting people to violence\nAnd the insinuation is is it the pipe bomber and the synagogue shooter were doing that because Trump called CNN fake news another non secular makes no sense whatsoever and all that is designed to get him to stop coming after them for exactly what they're doing which is propagating fake

but we do have a sponsor does then\nAnd now more than ... people need to be prepared [noise] 'cause I Know exactly ... if I hear shots ring out I Know exactly what I'm doing and what we need to have some more training around here too but your business needs to be trained to know what to do if you hear a shot bring 'em\nI mean whether it's you know where you're going to go to hide who's going to bring up the gun if you got one or whatever you just gotta you gotta know\nThink about that right now if you're at work\nIf you hear shots ring out what in the world would you do I mean you would probably be in a full panic running around not knowing what to do it's interesting because a lot of people don't get out you know it's like one of those horror movies get out and they don't get out\nAnd I've seen some videos of people who just you know there's an active shooter\nThere was one I saw a video or one and and there was a guy to mall several folks at a mall I I don't know where this was in\nBali or somewhere and they're just walking around the mall and their pop and people you anybody they see so this one guy you know everybody's running out of this department store and this one guy runs back and then in and then hides under a desk or something I'm going\nCome home and then of course you can see what the surveillance video they come walking through that department store guy glances down the if the guy hunting under the death blows them away kills him because he didn't that's the first thing you need\nTo leave you know you get and you need to know how you're going to leave\nAny way they are all sorts of things you can do a one of the most important things I took away from my one to one of these seminars is no where you are in the building\nAnd you go I Know where I Am in the building I'm over here by the window a you about the parking lot well\nThat doesn't do the police any good they need to know east west north or south they're going to come to the building they need to know is the you know if you tell them the gunman is at the opposite end of the building where where are you well I'm On the south side OK he'd be on the north side saying if you don't know that kind of stuff you can't say\nThere's so many lessons to learn and it's so tragic and it has to happen over and over again we're really got me was all of the media folks not all of them but a lot of um\nPiling on shrimp again this is this is true this guy hated Trump the guy hated Trump because he had Jews\nAll around them as his daughters Jewish his son in law's viewers his daughter in law's\nGrandchildren and all these Jews worker he hated trumpet ended the Jews this ... see I don't understand that\nI don't understand why you would hate Jews or anybody for that matter but I mean what is it worth the Jews you know and I know every group you know blacks Catholics Irish you know everybody has been picked on at some\nPoint sent me rich white people so [laughter]\nBut everybody I mean somebody finds somebody in general to hate and I don't understand that\nSee I grew up in um you know of course we had race\nProblems obviously but it was black and white type deal as it normally is in the south\nBut I grew up with a I knew two or three Jews growing up I knew the folks who ran Rosen blooms clothing store who ran ... another ... clothing store\nAnd there was another one I think I knew to whether it may have been just that I knew to Jewish people would you two Jewish families and it never\nCrossed my mind that hey Jay Rosen bloom growing up we go there and\nHe had a a store the mall and uh you know several of my friends worked near in high school and they had a big they had well I say big to let a console TV set up there on Saturday you know people go shopping mall we'd go by and see my friends and stuff and people were standing around\nWatching TV and the clothing store and you know shooting the bowl and maybe buying a belt or shirt or whatever for Saturday Night\nAnd uh I just and it never crossed my mind that you were supposed to be hating Jews she so\nJust I never got it but this guy had he just from way back\nI Can't tell you the more I'm going in and so he kills eleven people would have probably killed more if the SWAT Team hadn't been so quick on the spot but imagine though\nIf somebody had a gun there maybe maybe it wouldn't be eleven people dead and six in June maybe it's one or two and then somebody takes the guy out you've got to have somebody with a gun in these places because it takes to police it a while to get there and even if they come there in the first minute\nThey've already killed folks that was another thing I learned from the seminar\nAnd these high profile mass shootings usually says the first twenty or thirty seconds that everybody's dead\nThat's usually what it is and you can imagine if you have a gun and the first shot rings out of a shot rang out here\nYou know you don't know where it is but there are people in this building with a gun I'm not going to name names but there are people in the building where the gun and so shots ring out somebody's going to drop the guy\nI'm just saying\nSomebody is going to drop the guy long before the police or even called I Would\nThink and this is the way we've got to think about things I hate it I Wish it weren't this way but we have to be prepared\nFor the worst who saw that the synagogue will get shot up on a Saturday I Know that's when they're in some guy but who would have thought on a quiet Saturday in Pittsburgh that some nut shows up and start killing folks\nBut really what really really really champs my Sammy is everybody trying and the people who were trying to blame this on from\nWhat it is a despicable thing to do what an absolute despicable thing to do you want to hear despicable\nProtesters interrupt interrupting Marsha Blackburn\nBurn get out the vote rally and they had a moment of silence for the victims of the synagogue and these idiots you're yelling and screaming and all through the moment of silence what a bunch of flipping animals these people are\nThis is from a channel five in Nashville protesters began shaming
