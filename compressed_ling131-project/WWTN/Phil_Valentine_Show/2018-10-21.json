know I Want to see the rest of the documentation I Want to say I want to know more about it but that's my sense I'm not I'm not condemning automatically today I Want to I Want this investigation bacon plate of\nPresident Trump is pulling the U.S out of a Cold War era nuclear missile agreement with Russia correspondent credit played\nKept us on the one hand they saying that it believes\nHow exactly

nutrition may actually be one of the most\nStraightforward factors to change antisocial behavior and we know that it is not only highly effective it's also cheap and her humane\nAll right so those are some of the studies that were done and you can see there's a dramatic change in all of those studies just by adding in real food\nFood that uh we're supposed to be eating not fake processed food uh selves a one way to start that is just start eating real food again I Know it's a little harder than ah eating a lot of processed stuff that you can heat up in a microwave and a few minutes\nBut it would be well worth the time\nYou just start feeling better\nAll right so we're going to ah change subjects here that was on the kids and uh some a couple of studies I thought were interesting and so I brought those into a ... just show you what food can actually do\nTo your behavior and uh I find that true all the time that's why in my office we're always working on their food or we give a when somebody comes in we give them a food diary\nAnd I don't know how many people I have come in once they start writing down what they're eating come in and say oh my God I didn't know how bad I was actually eating a so we make you accountable for that we do have to get that in supplements by themselves can no longer overcome bad eating habits\nSo we change that now my office we don't change eating habits um we don't change him overnight or do anything cold turkey what we do is we do it on a gradient so we'll just work on breakfast we might work I'm breakfast three or four weeks then once we get that good and cleaned up then we'll move over and we'll work on a lunch\nAnd then we'll work on a supper but we got to get that cleaned up or it doesn't matter what supplement I give you are what vitamin I give you what vitamin you take off the shelf\nOr it's not going to work and never will work can't overcome bad eating habits\nSo I Want to stress that a\nLot of times when I'm even talking on the phone here and I'm giving them\nCertain supplements to taken or recommending this and recommending that I'm assuming that they know that they need to eat well and if you don't eat well you'll never a fix the cell and that's what we're trying to do with trying to get enough nutrition in there so we can get down on a cellular level and clean up the body [noise]\nAll right enough of that we're going to move on here and we're going to actually talk about cholesterol or this seems to be a hot subject I've had several questions this week at the office on cholesterol we always check everybody on their cholesterol we actually check it twice\nA one time or we check it after we get to all the glance and organs to a good stable point usually about four to six weeks into the program\nI Will do a a ... a check the cholesterol baseline it say are called the ... panel\nAnd we want to know what the numbers are before we start cleaning things up\nAnd then we go in and we do the uh the detox who start cleaning up deliver the GOP gall bladder the intestinal tract kidneys\nI'm into a ... and the systems that excrete things out like that so we get in and start cleaning them up and then after you're done with the a detox then what we do is we run a full blood panel and we re check the\nUm lipic panel but also we check the particle size of the cholesterol which is a more important than the numbers believe it or not but do doctors check particle size rarely\nA what we're interested in is there's two particle size up cholesterol large and small what we want is large which is called pattern a a ... you could think of it is large and fluffy kind of like a a cotton ball and that does not stick onto the ah arteries\nOr the pattern be is the one that we have to be careful of so let's say that your cholesterol numbers are a little on the high side and you come back with a a large cholesterol which is a good size a pattern a well we're not going to be to to uh uh\nToo concerned about the numbers because you've got the pattern a large size\nOr so that the chances of those sticking on the uh arteries are zero are now if it comes back on let's say that you're just a little over where we would want you to be\nAnd you come back and you're pattern be now we're going to roll up our sleeves and we got to take some action here we got to change pattern be back to pet her name\nBut in the meantime we're also going to have to support the ah arteries we're going to have to find out a and get you to change it to pattern a now the way you do that is over time obviously\nBut you'd eat deep green leafy vegetables that changes your cholesterol\nAh now there's two types of cholesterol and this is actually what we're going to talk about and this is the there again a couple of studies that that came out on this but uh this is what I Do at my office there's two types of cholesterol one is called H. D. L.\nHDL is what they call your good cholesterol um and it really is no bad and no good but this is the way that this categorized and so I'm going to use those terms\nSo of because people know what I'm Talking about your HDL is your good cholesterol your LDL is your bad cholesterol\nAnd you're a ... what happens is your good cholesterol and and I see this true all the time the good cholesterol controls the bad cholesterol it'll help to reduce the bad cholesterol so what happens is when somebody comes in in their ... their LDL as high\nI'm not too concerned about uh bringing down the LDL my all my efforts are going into bringing up the HDL most people\nThat come to me and I see many many blood tests or HDL is way too low [noise] we've got to get the good cholesterol up and that'll help to bring the bad cholesterol down All right we're going to talk about this a little bit more in detail give me some strategies on how to bring your uh HDL up our what\nOur veterans were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life [noise] let them know you can join me as a pro supporter of our veterans [noise] Hi this is Joe Montana and on the one hundredth anniversary of Veterans Day help no vets alone improve the lives of those\nWho have served our country please show your support and text V.

have a workshop coming up is going to be this\nSaturday the Eighteenth at ten am if you'd like to attend that workshop you'll learn a lot of things on how to get healthy stay healthy do it naturally just give my office called six one five three three three\nZero zero five six that six one five three three three zero zero five six and that's going to put you are in the help you to reserve your seat and uh get you to the workshop totally free absolutely free you're going to learn so much stuff on how to get healthy and stay healthy\nI'm never I never had a complaint and never had anybody upset about coming to the workshop that they didn't get enough information\nUh maybe I'll redo on the next segment segment some of what people said uh at the last workshop All right we were talking about a cholesterol and this is a big subject in a somewhat confusing subject to some people\nAre we most doctors are trying to get LDL down that's why they put you on a stand drug in my opinion nobody should be on a stand drug or because of all the side effects and how easy it is to bring cholesterol down naturally\nUh we talked about the different particles size up cholesterol in my office we're more concerned about particle size than we are the numbers\nAre we do get a a baseline before we do a Clinton's and then we get the particle size after the Clintons there's two sizes one is pattern a which is what we want that's the big and fluffy ... a tight and pattern be which is a small kind of like a bb type that's the that's kind of a dangerous one that's the one that is a stick onto the arteries\nAre also I said that uh it's not the cholesterol that causes the sticking apart\nThere has to be some damage to the arteries before a the cholesterol can even stick\nIf you look inside the artery the artery itself if you open up an artery is is slipping smoothed or like ice you could almost ice skate on it that can't be a lot of friction in there that blood is travelling fast food that artery and it can't have a lot of surface area hitting into into their slowing it down\nA about what happens is if we get enough sugar in our diet sugars traveling down through the artery and it will damage the artery and it gets rough for kind of like splinters kind of like a um board would splinter and then here comes the pattern be cholesterol and it can stick it pattern aid gets in there and won't stick to it\nAnd then it starts to build from there so really the cholesterol as a secondary problem it's not the primary problem but what do most doctors tell you\nSo the primary problem and ah quit eating eggs quitting bacon totally false uh it's been many many studies have shown that uh that's not what races cholesterol raises cholesterol is actually carbohydrates and sugar\nSo that's what we're concerned about at my office Ninety eight percent of all your cholesterol is made in your liver not what you're eating All right so if your cholesterol is high guess what we have a ... problem is what we have and that's what we fix at my office\nSo you need to come to the workshop six one five three three three zero zero five six\nAll right we've got eleven strategies here on how to increase your uh HDL which they considered the good cholesterol that HDL stands for high density lip it's a lifted says the cholesterol fat\nOr if you're HDL levels are lacking here some key ways to a boost them one exercise aerobics exercise uh the the kind that raises your heart rate for an extended period of time say twenty to thirty minutes\nCan increase your HDL if done regularly now regularly would be at least three times a week\nA examples of a real big exercise are going to be jogging biking fast walking aerobics and so on\nOkay Number two would be maintain a good healthy weight a you know your BMI is supposed to be in my stance for body mass um body mass index and your BMI should be between Eighteen and twenty five\nAnd if it's not a you're considered overweight if it's over thirty here considered obese\nSo oh you'd be surprised what your body weight is now this is something that we also check has to be in my aunt and my office I got to get a baseline of where the body is because it's going to change dramatically by the time we're done with your program\nSo uh maintain healthy a healthy weight if you're having a problem losing weight you have stubborn way do you do these yoyo diets all the time we know diets don't work for weight\nI'm it's already been proven\nThat somebody that goes on a diet they lose significant way let's say they won't last twenty pounds\nThey get off the diet within one year they'll gain all that way back plus more Ninety eight percent of everyone that goes on a diet games the way back again so diets don't work so that's not what we do at my office uh we have some um\nStrategies that will help you to uh eat what you not everything you want all the time but most everything that you are like in occasionally some things that that you should need and maintain a good healthy weight\nOr I recommend about forty grams of fat per day the good fat the avocados the alibi oil's a coconut oil those kinda things forty grams or what we want to get into the body you have to have ... dietary fat to burn fat to burn body fat\nI'm too little fat and your diet can lead to deficiencies of essential fatty acids and there's also been linked to significant reduction in HDL so there you go do a low fat diet and guess what you're HDL goes low to\nFor best results Egypt eat a variety of healthy fats [noise] All right here's number eight quit smoking yes now that could be the hardest thing for most people that are smokers\nAh quit smoking this will result in increasing your HDL levels or look at this the other way smoking decreases your HDL level and we're trying to get the good cholesterol up\nAnd consider taking nice and okay now we do do this at at my office uh we have ...\nAccording to the national cholesterol education program nice and which is actually vitamin B three is an important tool and normalizing cholesterol several studies have found that the vitamin can increase HDL by thirty percent there you go you don't have to eat that half an onion\nOr thirty percent which will lower total cholesterol by about ten to twenty five percent so you bring your HDL thirty percent your total cholesterol count will go down and to twenty five percent are now the the thing about nice and that people don't like is that it will give you a hot a flush\nIt will be will be like you look like you had a sunburn for about twenty minutes\nLuckily we have a nice and that they put into a a vegetable a vegetable is not in a capsule they call it a a matrix of vegetable matrix\nWhere it's it's the flushing nice and only the flushing nice and works on this non flushing nice and is is useless you might as well get rid of that you just wasted your money\nBuying that but this are nice and isn't a vegetable matrix so you don't get that hot flush for a twenty minutes some people they don't mind it but that's what nice and does what it does is it opens up the arteries it's burning up toxins in the body of burning things up getting things moving\nThat's what nice and does now when I forget to tell somebody if we give them just straight and I assume without that a matrix\nI forget to tell them about it I'll be getting a phone call they think that they're allergic to it you know that's the way nice and works a it's a good good product ah and ah I take nice and all the time\nA number or nine\nGet lots of omega threes and the essential fatty acids now these are found in fish or fish fish oil flaxseed walnuts has been found to increase your HDL\nAnd matter of fact we got him off all all those forms of government fish oils we got 'em in a flaxseed we can get your omega threes that way we also have plant based or a mega threes some people do a lot better on plant based on mega threes and they do on the fish oils\nSo those are the things that uh\nUh will bring your HDL up now I Want I Need to talk to you one more time about my workshop I got a workshop coming up this

family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about any form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effect the daily stress has on our bodies\nParkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nTo simply a lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that\nYou need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nYou know so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd they can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for\nPeople that have trouble sleeping really because it relax your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink

studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms\nMigraine headaches there's a whole category of of area that I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome\nWhich millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones to start getting all lost you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nThe calcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is kept out\nThis great absorption rate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAll right and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred he won nine to five seven five ...

about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this isn't an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like a ... a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing to do their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late [laughter]\nDon't you think is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain calcium\nAnd neither is excellent for back pain because\nThe calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the transmitters and the nerve and when you take us combat formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back mhm and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on this complex formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough but she was the one who took a week of ah the formula ... formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer making it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes you within us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles work in rural relax shape\nWell you really wouldn't think that to such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium may need them in the system you know the very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is\nExperiencing because of the fishing and ... and many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nSome it's really it's really a rat race I think it's a vicious circle\nIt sure is and we're you know what are you going

vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country are deficient in vitamin D\nThe fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone\nThat should be there and it's not

could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWell he has diabetes is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin and

down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr because I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three vitamin D three is\nThe activated form so it's ready to go to work now the vitamin D three that I use my formula I think it's\nThe best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taken this and they they test their blood every day to see how the dean is going and going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development and the humidity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity\nCardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for\nPregnant women is very very important ...\nPeople in their forties that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones him to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start telling

guys must happy or no as a puppy up because he's gone now either gone or replaced it with the oh um well I haven't\nDone that yet but I Do and next week I take\nUm I've got one senior in high school but he is playing for his first time away from with hockey and then um my oldest um is playing in the north American League so there will be some crocodile tears from this um and they're weak I Know we've got a great summer though and\nI still see them pretty much um weekends because I'm a hockey mom through and through so\nI'm before the break we were talking about\nUm are we in another housing bubble and I do think this is really the buzz around the country right now um if you look at\nThe different markets especially the big on metro cities um of what's going on there um\nHow I like to look at it and it's definitely a debate um one thing you can say really not Ford is the new the last recession the license bubble ... came at two thousand seven ... right and\nAnd that's ten years ago and usually every ten years there is some sort of correction that's just the numbers that it's just if you look at the graphs that's the way it worse or\nAnd but one of the key metrics that really goes through this is home prices so we do see we we say oh you know home prices are going up I mean that's a lot of what we talk especially here locally where I talk about that\nBut if you look at the facts and according to a quarter logic they reported the U.S median cells prize in June two thousand six was two hundred and forty seven thousand one hundred and ten dollars compared to ...\nUrged two thousand Eighteen was two hundred and Thirteen thousand four hundred was the median price across America so if you look at that\nThere is not the inflation is not now that was two thousand six was right before everything crash or you know the the bubble hit 'em which then we knew it was coming to I mean we always say well we know it's coming but what do you do we just kept going right [laughter] right [laughter]\nBut here we are they're so home prices can be debated now let's talk here locally I've just really ... we don't have facts were talking and the fact that we know dealing with the industry every day\nThere are parts of town that had desperately skyrocketed and cost\nBut why have they because we were so low on inventory you know new construction comes in which we needed but it it does cost money to build home there and so you know I had a home that was a new construction that took a while it was it beautiful and it was in\nA hot part of Franklin it took a while to get under contract and people were like it's over priced at ... ... it was priced out according to what it cost to build and it was just it's more expensive to build land is more expensive now\nBut when you look at those prices and they're still gauge off of cops and really what's happening here locally what's your take\nOn it I was at a function last night and this guy and he asked me you know what's my take on it and I'm asked him about his situation and he bought a home for short term rentals\nAnd it was a tear down and he paid I don't know I think let's call it seven hundred fifty thousand for it and now it's not legal for him to sell their home as a short term rental home\nAnd he's looking at values now instead of the seven fifty because there's a lot of homes that look like is that were purchased for that reason\nAnd he's looking at maybe six fifty on the market because it's no longer it can be a short term is right and there was a lot of homes built like that for that one purpose right a lot of like minded people\nThat's all that's an unusual pocket that were ... that that's a natural that you know it's not tested yet really whatever it's with what's going to happen to a lot of those homes that look like that with a lot of buyers that look like those buyers\nI don't know I mean if if a lot of them start putting them on the market that is going to be great because it's going to help out or anything to worry but at the same time if a lot of them put on the market simultaneously\n'em let that'll correct so I think you're going to have pockets of correction in some areas where people just went a little bit hot and and then we'll come back before as we might not see that same thing happened and you know and no one's you know I\nWell you definitely we felt the low end and tore right and so it started the new construction right and then you started investors pouring in and buying which now you've got calm switching up prices\nSo I mean it's it's just a very different market I Do not think it's the same market is two thousand six but there's definitely areas of softening and we see that because ... is the price matters in this market I've never dealt with the market that price matters as much as\nEight nine three zero three two two\nEight nine three zero three two to\nEight nine three zero three to two\n... actually [noise] while the\nThe voice of natural show I'm Sherry dire in Studio with me as a freshman at WDC more gay\nAnd we're talking about all the real estate if you have a ... should be sure to give me a tax said six\nOne five to three two forty three hundred we're talking about our market um what is really um all over the headlines are are we headed towards another housing bubble\nA we've looked at for key metrics and really debating each of them and I feel like I'm definitely we are in a different market\nUm things are nothing though like they were in two thousand six and I'm totally different\nUm I Do think price matters in this market and I do think you need to be smart in any situation in really gather all the facts\nWe do have homes that when they are price correctly and they are staged and they're gone yes they are selling quickly and we love that but we also see those homes that are sitting out there on the market but usually\nI usually when I go look at um there's a definite reason and it may simply just these price I mean\nI'm again price matters so home prices is a big one\nWe've spent some time talking about mortgage on I Am thrilled with the mortgage options that we have of today on overall do great do you see more people taking the lesser downpayment um options are are you still see in ten Fifteen twenty percent down\nIn depends on you know the person's age where they are financially I'm the more you put down the cheaper your product your mortgage insurance industry trying to be\nBut I Would say our younger generation doesn't have the savings a lot of times and so they're wanting a hundred percent financing which is out there in a vehicle to my people and certain income categories\nAnd that's that's something that used to not be around here I mean I think the biggest you know even gosh five to ten years ago the biggest hardship of buying a house was what the down payment\nYeah yeah and so if you're the key number that if you can like you're listening out there and you're trying to think of well okay what what's an amount of money that I can put in to really benefit me well three percent I mean if you can think of ... if you can find a way to say three percent of your sales price\n... there's some great incredible programs out there for you that will keep your mortgage insurance somewhat lower than a hundred percent loan and your interest rate better\nAnd that price point you would need to stay with them as what\nWell at three percent down the maximum amount of like four hundred Ninety four thousand um but I mean a lot of yeah yeah\nThat is and sang right but that has increased it as yeah yeah for sure\nSo I'm said three percent down okay foreclosure rates um of course a big key metric when you're looking at are we in trouble is how many foreclosures now my entire business from two thousand seven to really early two thousand eleven\nWas foreclosures and that's all I did come on and\nOn foreclosures in short cells\nI ... a day or almost non existent and I mean we we have those accounts and we do work some that they are nowhere and I mean they're they're like I said if I have\nTo close things on line ... ... that's like a big not now\nWhere in the past there will be thirty to forty closing so it was a big difference so definitely I'm not seeing that here locally and I can't speak for the United states on that but overall I Do know the numbers say they are extremely low across the nation\nBecause of course and that's why if you look at the investors there's always been investors investors are still buying things but they're buying different type things because back you know two thousand seven to two thousand ten they did buy the foreclosure property now they're buying as you said on the other like short term rentals\nOn things did convert condos to convert into rental properties or you know there's different ways or commercially the men have really gone ...\nThe um ... what we're talking about on the brake too is that I'm\nFifty eight percent of millennials claim that at home purchases being the best decisions and they can make is down um it's it's fifty eight percent of them think that it's a good decision which is actually at the lowest it's been in the last two quarters\nMeaning that quarter after quarter the millennial as more and more disenfranchised and um you know I think it's just interesting to me that a statistic that thirty two percent of them claim that they are not able to buy a house do to not being able to save enough money due to their diet\n[laughter] dietary yeah so we've got some healthy millennial\nThirty two percent of them have not been able to say that three percent down because they have a ... you know high\nThey want to eat healthy but they want to go out to eat and they want a house right oh they're like trying to balance and they want the house to be in an urban area the shake him walk her die store there twelve dollar jihadists their lifestyle and ... and ... and\nWe can lie laugh about it but it is very true I had a just a day for twelve dollars an hour thing you know you're going to cut back on your house is likely to get it\nUm but no you know those things are expensive\nAnd if that's the lifestyle that they are seeking I mean the sushi that you are at a I mean ... ...\nAnd they eat out at nice you know really cool fun places that I Love to go myself and its expenses\nWell we are seeing 'em when I said is different is that change it's a change with our new consumer and although we have all generations we sell to of course\nYou we still always go back to the largest generation is now in their thirties and that is the millennials right I mean that so we got this huge\nPopulation that you know they think and want ...\nDifferently you know and when it comes to housing\nThat the previous generations have misheard I say that now I've got a lot of my baby boomers are now becoming empty nesters and they're on the millennial wagon to LA like that live salaries well so um you know we do see we see it all out there but to your point it's a\nDifferent market ... on I'm not quite ready to say we're in a bubble for me I'm just not because things are selling the dollar market is good we do have people moving here\nI Will say totally different market though you know aids is not\nEvery with everything on well in the last thing comes down to housing affordability right you know and that still debated really across all metro cities because before your Nashville in ... how many people really were just desiring to live downtown now\nIs just booming and the prices are booming too\nBut so much of that is being in a awesome city sure you know you you look at Denver downtown it's great for the prices downtown are high to fish or you know a Minneapolis I mean the big cities you know we don't even want to talk about the California prices but again so we do see\nLess housing affordability downtown Nashville\nBut when you do talk about a board ability you can certainly go out the parts of summer county you can go to rather for you can go to Marie I mean there are areas that are extremely affordable\nBut then you know we didn't talk about commute times sure so on that and definitely a huge debate here locally in a debate across the country\nI'm I'm helping a family come from Los Angeles and uh we compared with they compared for me the cost of living differences\nAnd they're retiring and it's almost double their income that they're getting you know after expenses after not having to pay the state income tax not having to pay\nYou know all the different things they're literally having more two times the disposable income in Nashville and that was their number one\n... they're coming from California so yes they can out west they come from a newer and ... you know so I Do think it's where\nYou're coming to find love [noise] luckily in your mind said thank you so much for tuning into day we're here again to answer any questions you may have regarding all things real estate thank you see you next Sunday and God Bless [noise]\nNursing bail Nashville\nYou were talking about I mean I [noise]\n... the migrants walk continue time having hanging [laughter] now that the Saudis admit journalist ... died in their Istanbul consulate Saudi Arabia and foreign minister Adel al Jubeir told Fox News finding answers as to why will take time\nPrecincts and fortunately we haven't we want to make sure that those who are responsible for phonics and we went from a true that we have to use a\nWe've got thousands of people that have come opera every disease management medication known to man but people will come up with every kind of excuse\nNot to pay attention to their health or not to do something for their health and most of the time those excuses say more about their inner conversation in their doubt and their skepticism\n... about ... you know then the difficulty of actually getting healthy so I Would talk to you about you're talking about skepticism we've got some common themes that always come up when it comes to people not getting healthy or here's the first one I Can't give up food or drinks\nI Love well let me tell you something you don't have to give up your favorite foods in fact that's one of the barriers\nOf people trying to get healthy as they think they got to give up all their favorite foods and that's simply not true you can eat normal food you don't have the twigs and sticks and grass and sees all day or that's what birds do by the way in animals but we need to eat real food when eighty real food that's going to allow our bodies to\nTo have the nutritional profile that it needs for growth in metabolism and immune system function and hormone balancing a but again you can eat your favorite foods now you may not be able to eat a box of doughnuts everyday and think you're going to get healthy I think that's disingenuous\nBut you can eat your favorite foods and you don't have to give up your favorite foods and drinks you just got to know how to put it in the right order because of the code to your body success\nIs dependent upon that formula that we use called say your house and the second thing we always hear well I'm I'm I'm just not ready to make that type of commitment to my health let me tell you something this is the listen to me now if you don't act on your life\nIf you don't act on your health\nYour life in your health will act on you\nAnd ... and many people there are thousands of people not millions of people that wish they had the opportunity again to go back and take care of their health and they don't they're not they're no longer here with us on planet earth anymore\nBut you still have time if you still have breath you still have time for the third thing I we always years well I don't have the money to invest in the health program let me tell you something\nMore there are people that are more interested in money they they they prioritized money more than they do their health\nYou have an investment it's a small investment it's a small investment overtime and it's an investment that will give you back returns like crazy if you can get energy level back if you can get health into a into your body if you can sleep better and wake up more risk than what is that worth to anybody what's that word to live life\nTo the fool and be all that you were created to be what's it what's your work life we're a worth ... if you can live ten to Fifteen twenty Thirty years longer be with your kids and your grandkids and experienced that type of life\nSo the money is just a tool that's all it is\nSo be willing to invest yourself the next thing I've heard is I've tried everything before nothing works for me\nWell let me tell you something you stop telling yourself that lie you have not tried everything before I don't care what you've tried I've tried every weight loss program in America myself until I went to the altar three sixty lifestyle but let me tell you something I did weight watchers I did Jenny Craig guy did new system I did pills powders potions and lotion\nI did all that myself too I had some success\nAlways ended up failing because I couldn't sustain it for a long period of time and had very best there was a temporary fix\nI never took care of the core root of why down and healthy to begin with so stop telling yourself alive if you believe in the law that you tell yourself\nYou're not going anywhere with your health you have not tried everything and by the way even if you think you have tried everything you need to keep trying something into something works for you and something that will last for your health and we'll put you in the next platform\nIt goes on keep going on all these is talking about ...
