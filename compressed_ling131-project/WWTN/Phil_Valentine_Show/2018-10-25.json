where the investigation will lead but obviously on able to say when they'll get whoever's responsible for the now Tim suspicious packages\nFirst and foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe there are no current credible threats winning individuals' organizations or locations here in New York City CNN\nReports at least some of the packages may have been male fruit Florida three more packages were discovered today to set the former vice president Joe Biden in Delaware and wonder where to Robert Deniro in New York New York governor Andrew Cuomo was that several of the package is too high profile figures in his state\nFrom Phil Bredesen [noise]\nParents who are here and\nThere you go game over that's all you need to know when that word gets out\nWhich is that a few thousand poor people are gonna be mad at first no threat to security come on now she just being ridiculous [noise]\nWell what is a threat to us or what let me ask Mr Bredesen what does he think is a threat to our security what what qualifies as a threat to our security if a few thousand people which by the way\nWhat do we tell your yesterday was fourteen thousand it'll be twenty thirty thousand if they make it all the way to the border at the rate they're going now\nBut let's just say it's fourteen thousand fourteen thousand people we have no idea who they are flooding across the border is not a threat to our security are you kidding me\nThe bomber such as it is Robert Deniro got one Joe Biden got one of course we got Maxine Waters and Obama and Hillary\nWe now know that the so called ISIS flag that was on the bomb is a parody and it's it looks like the ISIS looks like the Arabic but it's actually in the middle of it scantily clad uh figures women\nAnd underneath it get her done so this is one of two people this is either an idiot\nWho's gone rogue who happens to support Trump and thinks this is funny or this is a leftist masquerading as a rogue idiot Trump supporter who thinks he's being funny\nAnd at this point I couldn't tell you which is which\nBut I Will tell you this if we find out it's a left is that's doing this I'm not blaming Maxine Waters just like we didn't blame Bernie Sanders\nFor the guy that shot Steve ... you have crazy folks who take politics to an unbelievable level\nAnd believe that they're doing the right thing and they're not they're crazy it is not it is not the responsibility of people unless they're saying hey why don't you go out there and make a bunch of pipe bombs and send them to folks and that's not happening that's not happening\nWhile we have here are fringe lunatics on both sides and we don't know who this person is yet whether it's a leftist or whether it's a right wing person but it doesn't mean that Donald Trump is the reason for it if it turns out to be some\n... wearing idiot and not to say that if you're wearing a magnet that you're using them saying an idiot wearing a mask at if it\nTurns out to be some cranes left this anti foot type well then that's on him it's not on everybody else now I Will tell you the problem is the mainstream media does not call the shots they do not call the balls and strikes accurately on both sides\nFor instance when you had the Steve ... shooting and the guy was out there hunting Republicans\nNot one person in the mainstream media attributed that to Bernie Sanders which he was a Bernie Sanders volunteer or anybody on the left or any of their rhetoric but this guy we don't even know who he is and they're already blaming Trump they're already blame the Republicans they blaming talk radio\nThey're blaming everybody on the right that they can and then they will but we're not blaming anybody this is hilarious do I have this still you know\nA ... and\nThis is a John King ladies and gentlemen\nJohn King on CNN says no one is blaming Trump for the attacks and then the tire on at the bottom you know the printed stuff at the bottom says CNN Trump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting cereal box [laughter]\nNow I don't know if that's something that somebody has well that's media I they're putting it out there so I assume this is not photo shop but I mean this is a typical stuff they're out there saying something out of their mouth\nAnd then two minutes later they say something completely different women are blaming Trump with Trump needs to tamp down the rhetoric I mean look at this has just gotten toxic out there you're not blaming Trump but you need him to to to tamp down the rhetoric\nWhen folks\nWhen has Trump advocated sending pipe bombs to George Soros I don't think he ever has does he talk about the left wing media the fake news absolutely they are a huge problem and he's been tweeting about that today to matter of fact it's always instructive to go to the president's tweets\nBecause ah for one thing they're just drop dead entertaining but also they gave us a glimpse into what he is thinking now a lot of what he's been tweeting about today has been this opioid deal\nWhere they're trying to get that crisis under control and then of course he's been going around and and speaking for different candidates out there and so he's been tweeting a lot about\nThat but he tweeted this this morning\nA very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely faults in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful\nThat is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast and he's exactly right about that\nAnd then each what it is the New York times and you want to you want to give you a first class example of fake news\nThe New York times he says has a new fake story that now the Russians in Chinese glad they finally out of the Chinese\nAre listening to all of my calls on cell phones except that I rarely use a cell phone and when I Do it's government authorized I like hard line just more made up fake news so they're out there saying that they have evidence\nThat the Chinese and the Russians are listening to Trump do official business on a cell phone and he very rarely even uses a cell phone and when he does is the security cell phone he uses a land line in the oval office when he does his business [noise]\nI'm just telling your phones it's gotten ...\nHave their gotten crazy and\nSea of any other tweets and he's just talking about the other places he's going to ah to campaign today so I mean that's basically it from Donald Trump I mean he's saying that the\nThat the mainstream media folks were their lives are making people angry and they are have they made this person so angry they're going to send fake pipe bombs to Debbie what's his name Schultz and the rest of these people who knows it may turn out to be that case but I don't know that you you certainly can't attribute\nDonald Trump so every time we have a shooting\nThey try to find some link to conservatives what's his face or an ABC the got booted yeah he did that a couple of ... and Brian Ross did this a couple of times and finally they said they've had enough they can't trust this guy\nEvery time there's a shooting they tried to find some\nConservative connection but what happens inevitably is more times than not there's a liberal connection and then they just drop it they don't want to talk about it than if they find that at some crazy Bernie person or whatever shooting Steve skull Lisa oh that doesn't mean anything that doesn't mean anything at all\nAnd I'm here to tell you it doesn't mean anything but it's kind of not mean anything both times on both sides when we have a nut case\nThis either blowing up folks are sending fake bombs or shooting people at a baseball park or whatever\nIt's on them unless somebody has specifically said go shoot Steve ... she's going to be at the baseball park at nine o'clock in the morning\nThat's a different story but you don't hear that and if you do then that somebody who is directly culpable for the event I haven't heard anybody on the right say send George Soros a pipe bomb I haven't heard that at all if you do hear that they're crazy\nAnd here's the other thing too at the obvious obviously\nYou're going to do this as we had the bomb expert that we were quoting from yesterday he says think\nThat landed on track again school I've learned that I

day and she was talking about how it went Halloween costume crackdown university targets inappropriate inoffensive costumes\nAnd she was wondering why is that you can't um that you can dress as as a black character if you're white person I've been wondering the same thing I don't see why that would be a problem here's a related story Megan Kelly they'll apologize for black face white Santa and fat shaming\n[noise] [laughter]\nYeah 'cause I think sometime in the past she said that Santa Claus is white for crying out loud we don't need a black Santa Santa Claus is white well historically that's been the case I mean that's here's something else\nWas his name ... or ... whatever his name is the blackout redefined black actor but there was talk but they were going to make him James Bond is that culture appropriation because James Bond was a white guy so if we have a black guy portraying a white guy is that called no no no no no that's progress you see\nThat's entirely different see I don't have any problem with that I didn't think he I still don't think he's a good fit to be James Bond but if they find a black actor who would be a good fit to be James Bond I wouldn't have any problem with that I mean I think\nYou know Ian Fleming wrote him as a certain person but I mean we've got him you know at least for a time was a woman's back to being a man now oh speaking of man owned by gosh\nThe creepy foreign lawyer the creepy pouring lawyer who is going to be probably twenty twenty a Democrat nominee or not enough money but certainly somebody's going to run\nThis guy was a long long ranging ah interview with time magazine and amongst the things that he says and let me so I don't want to miss quote him and he says\nA run for president was for us to have an Audi into the middle of the party's identity crisis\nThe Democrats have not been this powerless since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd their members have responded by nominating historic number of women and people of color for office\nBut when it comes to the party's presidential nominee in twenty twenty ... thinks it in different terms quote I think it better be a white male he says he hasten to add that he wishes that weren't so but it's undeniable that people listen to white man more than they do to others it's why he's been successful representing\nA Daniels Stormy Daniels and immigrant mothers he says when you have a white male making the arguments they carry more weight he says should they carry more weight absolutely not but they would do they\nYes and now he's saying I never said any of that I Would think that the time report it probably has this on tape you know they lose the run a tape recorder so he says the nominee better be a white male\nIn other words words he means is not a white male they can't win wasn't he a Hillary supporter I think he was I'm sure he was had to have been but he thinks that the nominee for the Democrats has to be a white male live better be it better be a white male\n\nSpeaking of that uh [noise]\nAnd I had another so yeah he's a you know we told you he's getting sued but also he's got another snoop full of troubled Grassley on the Senate Judiciary committee chairman\nReferred Julie sweating and Michael ... to the environment of justice for possible criminal investigation over allegations they made false statements to Congress about Brett\nKavanaugh for well off of [noise] Grassley\nWrote a letter to Jeff Sessions I Am writing to refer Mr Michael ... and ms Julie sweat Nick for investigation\nAnd he says for potential materially false statements they made to the committee during the course of the committee's investigation\nIn a statement Grassley said when a well meaning citizen comes forward with information relevant to the committee's work I take it seriously it takes courage to come forward especially with allegations of sexual misconduct or personal trauma I'm grateful for those who find the courage\nBut in the heat of partisan moments some do try to knowingly mislead the committee that's unfair to my colleagues the nominees and others providing information who are seeking the truth\nOr not he has said that the referral is completely baseless and political I look forward to a thorough investigation of the judge\nKavanaugh will have an ... says we have all waited long enough by the way that I tell you the nominee better be a white male bad or be a white male this guy this snake this this creepy foreign lawyer this if the Democrats nominate this guy to take on Trump oh my gosh\nYou may as well kiss the party goodbye at that point\nThe pope is comparing conservatives to Hitler\nI now I Know I Know\nThis comes from me on metal dot com\nPope Francis associated populous than conservatives concern with protecting borders the Hitler before warning that the sewing of hate led to the second World War it was during the book launch in Rome the positive told the crowd that Nazi Germany expanded power by of populism\nAnd then said that help is needed to educate the young people about the history of the second World War so quote that they do not fall into the same mistake and no help populism spread the he spoke to a huge crowds which included film director Martin Scorsese\nAnd says I think of Hitler last century who had promised the development of Germany that we know how populism starts by showing hey you can't live sewing hang\nHis remarks were made after a woman who teaches Italian to refugees told them at the book launch that she was concerned about a rise in anti migrant sentiment according to the DSM\nHe says that governments are allowed to set immigration limits adding that it was important for all of Europe to strike a deal on this problem\nIn January of last year Pope Francis warned against rising populism and the dangers of allowing political crises the usher in dictators\nLike Hitler so [laughter] you know Trump is a populist as sort of like Hitler bits you know

people get that behind them and everything but you should\nLeft Fox News that was I Wonder if they'll take her back of course she's got sixty nine million dollars come and so she probably doesn't need to do anything I'm just telling you folks I Love my job but you give me six\nA million dollars you'll never see me and\nI got stuff I Want to do at home I'm just saying I don't know what do you feel you would sell out oh sure\nNo I'm not a sellout I'm just saying if somebody gave you sixty nine million dollars which pretty much feel your job is important [laughter]\nYou've got to elucidate leave smarter and all that kind of stuff I get it I understand but at some\nPoint you want to go okay it'd be nice to ride off in the sunset\nI have got what I'm going to tell you that because then you think I Am a least well I'll just tell you this I was having a disc or anything and leave this and I don't know I'll tell you my wife\nAnd I taught for a law we've talked for a long day at least I was talking about this and then she started got sort of got on board with it\nAnd um\nWe thought you know if if if I ever get to a point where I retire that we would buy one of those big old I mean really nice Winnebago type things\nAnd go across the country and so I was talking to my brother in law who is talked about doing the same thing and he said have you priced those things I said I have not\nHe said I mean really for a really good one and see I'm going to say you know and that's not true you're given but he's saying you know you look at it upwards of two hundred thousand dollars for some of these things I mean they've just been talking about the really big ones that are all I'm not talking about some people behind you I'm Talking about a self contained you know\nAnd so I started thinking about it you know if I had two hundred thousand dollars to blow on a Winnebago or whatever here's what I Would do I take a really nice SUV and I'd go across the country and stay at every five star resort between here in California and pocket the rest I mean can you imagine how much less that would be\nSo if we did retire on a time of doing that you know all the time you're going to take a big long trip of a couple of months or whatever go across the country go to California you know drive all over the uh the Grand Canyon see Mount Rushmore and all that stuff\nBut it would be a lot more cost effective if you've got money for one of those big Hong crews out there\nJust to get you a nice comfortable SUV and and map out every five star resort between here in California\nI mean in just in ... when when you leave you're probably not two or three hours from the next and it's not like you've got to drive overnight to get there you go check in your you know get a massage go hang out in the pool have a nice dinner you know maybe go dancing and all that stuff\nNext morning you get a nice breakfast get back in your SUV and where's the next one was about three hours from here we go to do it all again\nYou're such an elitist\nHow did I get off on that I have no idea we were talking about oh the parade and a and the district parade\nSo you get a Tim Cook out there being proud of being gay and I'm not getting it and the woman with a bumper sticker saying she's proud to have a gay student and I'm not getting it because I think if you got when I Know some of you folks who are gay so when you don't understand\nI mean we we've been we've been ridiculed and beat up and you know all the rest of the game violence I\nUnderstand that but this is a different world I don't know my kids grew up in in a time in a high school and stuff where that was no big I told you about one of my sons and he's got a gay friend\nAnd I'm the guy called him and said he had a yeah I Can't remember the I think it's either a flat tire or he he needed to jumpstart a car one of the others one of the other and he said can you come and help me and my son said\nDon't be so again you can change a tire okay [laughter] he said you can you too but right there's not there's nothing to it you got the man up man come on and the guy changed his own tire and thanked them for later\nBut I mean my my kids have gay friends and you know I mean there's it's just whatever I mean it's a different time now I Know when I was growing up but I Will tell you this\nI had a gay friend he was probably I I don't you one of my best friends I had a bunch of guys that I Would say we're you know some of my best friends and this guy we did ... I mean when we got into high school we were going out you know he and I going out and you know cruising and meeting up with folks and everything about every\nSaturday Night\nAnd I I Would have sworn he was gay I mean you know I didn't know I mean he was inflaming but he was enough to I'm going well this guy's probably gay and he would talk about you know women and stuff but you know I knew he was a really serious and I'm\nAs it turns out I Believe he lives in Atlanta right now and he's gay and I was gay before he knew he was gay\nI mean I'm sitting there looking at George Michael been wham and wake me up before you go go and he says you know it was like several years after that before he knew he was gay and we all knew he was gay\n[laughter] hello\nMichael George did you look at your video okay All right um but I never\nHad a problem I mean I didn't go in and nobody said to me you know your friend is gay and you shouldn't be hanging I mean even back then this is in the seventies it was you know nobody gave him a hard time about a nobody questioned it nobody demanded to see him you know sleeping with a woman so he could prove himself no you know none of that it was just sort of you know\nGo along get along type stuff\nAnd we certainly today or in a situation where if you're gay or whatever I mean we work with a lot of gay folks union entertainment business they're all over the place\nIs infested with them I'm just kidding they're just they're gay folks everywhere and it's it's no big deal so why you've got to put a bumper sticker on your car saying you're proud of it I mean what does that saying you know it says to me it means you're not really proud of it you're trying to convey that bumper stickers now for me it's for you\nYou're trying to convince yourself that you're that you're a mom and you're proud of you are gay son\nAnd you're probably not why don't you just treat your gay son like you treat everybody else like we treat your gay son like everybody else why don't you do that why you got to call it out so every time mom drives up the school or whatever would be you know I got I'm proud of my gay students go oh my God she's reminding everybody [laughter]\nWhat's going to come with a bumper sticker [laughter] I have to live by always straight and there comes mom you know hey my\nGay son how are you how's it going to be gay today good great
