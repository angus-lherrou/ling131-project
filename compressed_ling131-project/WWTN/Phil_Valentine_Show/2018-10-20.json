I think in your situation you're going to want some sort of plan whether it's will or a revolt couple trust\nAt the survivors death sets up the trust that can receive both the insurance and the house and you can name the inlaws as trustee and then allow for them to control it through the trust they don't own it personally it's just owned by the ...\nWell there's two things on that one I'm a jump in and be devil's advocate a little bit so what if only right now he doesn't have really any plan I mean he you know he's verbally or whatever but let's just say he passes away I'm a kill him off let's kill him off and so you've got the wife and the children without a well what happens\nWell if she's the beneficiary of the life insurance she will get that directly with the house um the house depends if you own it jointly with writers survivorship or attendance by the entirety and then she will inherit the house okay if you own the houses tenant and common or he owns the house individually\nThan it will be split between your spouse and the children\nWhich again she can't really sell the house that she wants to downsize at that time\nShe would have to go get some papers or you know I mean it would cost them money where feet it put a little money and I mean a wills are fairly inexpensive I'm not saying I mean for self\nMice in you know my suggestion is you really kind of need a will or to make sure that all the documents are in order because the problem is life happens and we change and we forget like I said it's been a number of years I forgot things happen\nUm so I think\nTo make sure that you're in this is all this is pretty typical for young couples any ways I think you get married you have some kids and you've already had the agreement with the in laws it's not like you know I Am I have a nice it or he told me basically something happens on the God parent whatever and yes I Would take care of that child I don't think they would second guess but like you say if\nSomething happens to one of them and their caregiving that will they be able to take care of the kids at the same time\nYou know I mean so you kind of need to sit down at least have a written document that represents a well and go in and get something done so that there's something that and the problem is Han writing your own well can be a problem right Russ\nYou can do it all you have to do is sign in day to the problem is\nWe've never had one that's come across our office that actually does what it was intended to do and I'm not trying to take that away from anyone that might be trying to do it on their own it's just that there are so many little nuances and setting these things up\nJust to give an example I had one client that died had a handwritten will and she said I Want no money to go to this person or that person ended up inheriting all the real property could have court\nInterpreter moneys as meaning money not real property and everyone else knew that she meant anything right so it's just little stuff like that that you don't necessarily think of that the court would look at\nBecause of the well it will go to ... and there are a judge may miss read or not understand the same way but in his cage is pretty much can be in I mean\nNothing he should write his own I'm just saying that you need to have something very basic to start out with and then you can always upgraded as you get a little better but getting something out there that's probably a little bit more regulated than just the insurance is great because a lot of people don't even do that but that way\nYou know I'm just concerned that if if something happens most of us do you have the most is a typical have joined tendency for a husband and wife both on the house I mean it's a pretty typical on the mortgage payments\nYeah they're usually the title company will set it up a husband and wife co owners that terrific but on the Internet\nWere both co owners on the house yet and then of course I'm a bit of pitcher yet but they're not ... with my white person in my writing or\nJust in case and then I guess there will be um would be my kid in in in ... in case something really bad happened world or of a way it and we have a plan for the early ... at least the money would be\nA good really inlaws I guess at that point because they would be one of the beneficiaries so they still get the money you know if you're the money for passed away and kids and they will ended\nBeneficiary is the way to get me just in case could literally it's been more was\nIt I mean at least with the well it's going to basically carry you through what what you really want I mean the fact is if the as the kids get older it's probably less and less\nImportant but when they're little they can't make any decision so it's not like they have a lot of input so at least with the will you have some structure and also with the will usually I mean what happens if you don't die but you're incapacitated you're not able to do something years who mean your wife is going to do it but\nMaybe you don't want to be kept on life support I mean I'm just saying you could put all that in there so she doesn't have to make some of those decisions you pretty much have put your wishes in a form that would tell the doctors\nDon't reset test or whatever it's called one don't bring me back there 'cause usually when you get the will done you'd also do the power of attorney part or any for healthcare and living well which would cover all of those things\nSo just the thought but that's a great question thank you for calling Nick really appreciate it but\nUm and I know it's a lot for people and a lot of people when you're young last thing you're thinking about well what happened to me but the problem is if you don't have those ducks and the ...\nLike you said Tennessee has a plan for you and I guarantee it was like the IRS filing your tax return it is not a plan that we want we do not want to go that

always [laughter]\nIt's like you're telling me that I ... my dream\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat\nBut you know in in reality what we're looking at here is a situation where somebody is just ill prepared they don't know what to expect next to it was like I was was actually listen to this one gentleman talk about\nPlanning in general and I thought this is such this this stuff is so good you know what is the benefit of planning and he was just talking about how\nYou know part of the benefits of a financial planning is number one organization you know you can get somebody to get more organized with their financial life journey to life in order I get things you know where it's all together you know where it is and you know what everything is and you'll how things work together\nAnd he was talking about you know that he saw the benefit and we certainly see the benefit of accountability\nYou know when somebody commits to something you can help keep them accountable and I thought that was a really great point to and objectivity another part of it you know being able to help people around emotional decisions\nBut when I'm getting to here was part of it was one of the things he said that really hit me and he says pro activity\nAnd the part about that is what he meant was that as a plan or what you do is you help people anticipate financial life transitions and get prepared for them\nAnd I'll never forget one of the classes I took on retirement planning and this guy says be very sensitive to the fact that you're going to be helping people plan for a stage in their life\nThat they have never been through and that his retirement where they are not working and they're not earning a pay check anymore and they are relying on their investment portfolios and they're not in the workforce anymore he says but don't ever forget\nThat you've never been there either\nYou try and and and I thought you know that's very very true and I and I thought about this lot and I thought but you know isn't it interesting having done this for coming up on Thirty years I have clients many clients that have been in that in our in that stage so\nI can you speak vicariously from their situations and what I've seen and what are observed and I think that's one of the benefits of planning and being planners is not only that but we also have a tremendous amount of data on what to expect in retirement\nAnd this is one of those things to expect expect that there is a good shot that may be health will decline and you're going to have to have this type of care and realizing that this care is not cheap\nYou know Seventy eighty Ninety thousand dollars a year mhm and most people are ill prepared to be living on and this was a woman I Am talking about right here that has an income that is pretty significant I wanted to tell you use thirty five hundred and four thousand dollars a month\nOkay I think is there any ... you know so that's half of it's not terrible nursing home ... used to living but that's when that's when you go you know about that half\nAnd because of that this is the type of care that can be afford it on a level of income that for most people would be fairly reasonable right\nSo you got to be prepared for this type of stuff so what do you talk about when you're ... you're talking to people yeah they don't want [noise] I'm going to cut you off

[noise]\n\nWhen you're on a must because you can show them away from here and foreigners gym would [noise] case of Jim ... talking about this long term care we're talking about in nursing home with\nForging this stuff in retirement and what do you think there are some of your thoughts were definitely\nHad some thoughts and just actually recently having this conversation multiple times\nAnd it it will really came to mind is what an issue this is for for just a great multitudes of people because you have the people out there that just don't have a lot of savings don't have many assets and they're going to ... take\nWhat they you know have to take and then you have people that have so much money that they can sell for sure but the great majority of people\nAre in between ... and there are the ones that really need to address this and really consider everything we're talking about in more and have these conversations\nUm you know with us with the long term care professional with their family that type of thing and and talking about policies that how they were priced in the past and the problems with the increase in premiums and things like that\nThe outlook doesn't look as bad well they still can definitely go up based on all these things we talked about they are much more likely to be priced radically yeah these days are released a lot closer in terms of a more realistic\nUm assumptions about interest rates and the money that they're going to make on the bonds and that type of stuff and also it much better idea of what the claims are going to be and people keeping the policies and all that so\nThat puts them in a position of likely not having such significant increases in payments but it is it's a tough unknown you like to go in\nOne of the great things if if you could just go in and know exactly what you're going to pay overtime and that makes the decision\nYou know a lot easier than if well I Hope it's this and I hope it doesn't go up and that's a real big issue for people especially when you're trying to budget what isn't an insignificant X. men into your you know monetary output\nMhm yeah and I found that when I Would when I've been talking about people they actually expected something like a retention rate of like Ninety five percent and one of the one of the courses that I took\nA ... at the American college they actually talked about that they had a retention rate they figured that that many people would hang on these policies and then when it was like Ninety nine percent of people held on the policies all of a sudden they said now\nThey've got and it just seemed like it would be that big of a deal but it was a big deal in terms of the amount of claims that they had to pay out and that was problematic and they start raising the premium significantly and from what I understand they're actually pricing them a lot more conservatively today with higher expected payout rates\nAre from what I've been reading on the topic so I think that you're absolutely right it's it's one of those things that\nI that had to be addressed is finally being addressed the other issue is people are typically buying policies with shorter beneficiaries\nAnd they're not necessarily trying to buy a lifetime benefits anymore no you know for for no reason 'cause it's it's five years\nAnd had been most I see typically\nYeah it's it's prohibitive to go out and buy a lifetime bending down hardly exist anymore few companies have actually come out with policies and one I can think of\nThat actually has a ten year pay where you pay the premium ten years down you're done\nAnd that I've always been a pretty big fan of for a long term care is just pay it you're done if they have a premium increase in the future well it's that's their problem you've paid off your premium and you're done\nI and I think that there's something to be said for that right there what um what about you what you're talking about Evan during the break you were talking a little bit about the issue of the quality of care yeah also thoughts regarding that\nUm I I Will say I learned is when the hard way um but we've had family in\nSimilar conditions maybe not quite that squalid but\nPretty came mhm in early on in my career I talked with two or three clients that were in the same kind of a situation and kind of what ... talking about I'm speaking as much to the people that have the money to pay for this right as the people that likely end up in a facility that's being funded by medicate\nOkay right right so some of these ... these long term care facilities that's where their funding comes from\nBut here's here's what we have found is human nature doesn't change mhm and the quality of care that your family member or friend receives in a nursing home\nIs directly correlated to the amount of involvement family has with that person ... if you are if you're visiting all the time if you're talking to the staff if you're bringing cookies if you I mean just the typical yeah human nature stuff\nYou could be a millionaire and if no you know if the kids never come to visit you're going to be living in those kind of conditions even if you're paying that since you if you're medicate facility in yeah your church groups are always coming over this and that you're gonna be in a pretty darn good\nCondition and so I mean to me that's kind of a ray of hope is you do have a lot of control over some of that\nStuff in and I have clients that are that have been in nursing homes are the ones that right now are the ones who passed away since but I Would go in there and I got to know the staff absolutely and you know it was it was really nice when you saw their family members in there as well\nYeah and and unfortunately ... so it was pretty rare anything man don't get involved over there right\nYou know because and then and that and the other thing is that you know I had somebody from the state of Tennessee on the show\nAnd we were just talking about elder abuse in general yeah and that we have an obligation to report this type of stuff\nI you know there was actually a lot of worry years ago that if you report it and if it wasn't true that you could be held liable and in that you were\nYou could actually get in trouble for reporting somebody for something that they didn't do in in soil in the reputation so to speak something of that nature and she said no not anymore yeah you know if you\nSee something going on you have an obligation to actually report to report this which I think and you won't be held\nLiable if it if we investigate and we find out it's not true we need like a hashtags senior me too movement or something you think\n[laughter] when you hear about facilities like that did you described and it's heartbreaking yeah and I'm sure they exist but I also you know perhaps to the ones that aren't that way for the people that are in that and it's tough to care for seniors for Alzheimer's patients for those types of things and for the people would do that\nIn the facilities that are truly caring truly doing good care and stuff like that I mean just all the props for those people in those facilities because they are out there to my grandfather was in one for about five years in California and you know\nFor his situation and stuff they treated him very well they took care of him there was some issues from time to time but because like Kevin was saying my mom would frequently go down and seeing my uncle would go in he had friends that came into the work when things like that\nThat is something needed to be done it was addressed and that was always address like and what I'm saying because somebody was bringing it up that it might not have if it\nYou know just if somebody was bringing it to anybody's attention 'cause that's the one thing my grandfather wasn't going to bring it to anybody's attention\nAnd it's also ... I like about my ... probably hate me saying this but I'm just hate anyway\nMy son would do this he would go down and he would go watch football with the guys at the nursing home on Sunday ought to be fun oh yeah and in reality we can all get involved in that way I you know from an investing standpoint let me just hit something that has been a topic over the past few weeks on and off\nAnd the topic is I've been talking about artificial intelligence and and you know robotics and and so on so forth I think you know we look at this and we say that a lot of these expenses are just out of control in nursing home facilities in assisted living facilities\nI think one of the interesting innovations it's going to be coming down the road and you guys know made the eternal optimist\nI think one of the interesting innovations is robotics and artificial intelligence and helping with care in facilities like this because you think about that I was I was talking to a gentleman this week and he's a business owner runs a swimming pool company\nAnd he had the most fascinating story about a a a dairy\nAnd he was talking about this dairy and just talk about how the cows moved through and everything was automated you know you wait the cows and and when the cat went in and you knew what it weighed you know we knew what it was supposed to way so if it weighed more when I walked into the barn\nAnd so this is a person that uh is way behind the eight ball ... and called last week\nHey the U.S is up acts and we're only up X minus y mhm and so we have this linked linked the conversation while it's 'cause you don't have everything in X here's why we don't want to chase performance and so forth ... well\nYou know the president I think things are going you know this you know these ethnic categories that haven't been doing well they're holding me back and I've got to catch up 'cause I'm sixty eight ...\nAnd I don't have that much time to let it grow and I think us is going to be doing what you know just kind of right that conversation well us stocks are selling ... times what our national are mainly you to do better amazingly\nHe was going into the category that happened to have the best performance over the last eight or ... minutes yeah who knew yeah yeah yeah the endless common mistake that investors are always you know professor rebalancing opportunity you also don't have enough time to make mistakes with right just amount of money right in terms of you know now that you're\nTrying to play anything happening leaning remember remember the late nineties when when this battle is being fought and you're sitting there going no don't do this don't do it and then over the next\nEleven years there is absolutely zero return for a larger without a diverse if you're a horror fully\nWas only making Fifteen but us was making twenty eight you know like okay\nYou have them you know what to do with that was the late nineties Brian going forward or are you in a way to zero in a negative return and diversified was just fine but ... it couldn't stop him chasing it\nAnd uh you know and so that you know there's just an emotional component it becomes not an intellectual exercise for somebody at that point they they can't think\nRationally and clearly mhm and there is any number of illustrations of that frankly in society same thing with you know meet passion crispy cream I don't think rationally and clearly one of the red light on that [laughter]\nI Know that you go to our reason I Know that it I I don't and I think that it happened with the radio [laughter] answer how donuts but well you know and so here's this person that's going to make a mistake yeah and has no time to recover from the mistake\nAnd that's it that's a tough thing to see especially when you relate to story of that's where they can end up because they have no assets and now they can't care for themselves we we can see that anticipate that in\nIn the end the ... hard as the investing industry they ... they pray on eBay they they go and look what's going on look what's happening the media does it\nYou know the media does it because you know there that's that's all they know quite often you know I Would get an interview and they talk about the ... it's only thirty companies it's only thirty companies but you know if you look at the Dow in the S. and P. five hundred I Can't remember what it was I Want to tell you that those thirty companies make up\nOver forty percent over forty percent\nRight the S. and P. five hundred thirty companies out of five hundred companies\nAnd it makes up a man I Can't remember what it was Jim did the charges pretend I I don't remember how I you know what I'll pull it up for the next I'll I'll pull it off and and and I'll take a look at it

diversified isn't it and we'll known those thirty stocks make up\nA very high percentage of the total market [noise]\nAnd what happens is people think they're diversified and they haven't really known

I mean we over simplify a lot on this show a lot of things going on underneath the hood that are really cool from an academic standpoint\nBut really by far and and a lot of that stuff is great for reducing expenses no question about it and that's why we use it up and not you know using you know the index is because of the capitalization waiting that we talk about and and not using ... price weighted index isn't and things like silly things like that\nAnd not you know a lot of the um a matter of fact one of the things I just taught about I just finished teaching about was a smart bait investing\nIn literally what's going on in the investment industry right now is you have these big investment firms taking some of this academic stuff that we talk about and using it as a marketing scheme\nAnd it is silly how they're doing it a matter of fact there's one that is actually using the momentum which is one of those one of those things that they're talking about as as being a great use of a of a vehicle to help returns\nAnd in effect when things I was teaching was that the cost of actually training utilize momentum\nIs over ridden the cost of doing it overrides the benefit in all of these different uh the funds that are actually using this\nAnd then you actually have returns that are are in the negative versus benchmarks in other words when they utilize momentum even though there is a momentum effect you know in other words an object in motion stays in motion\nAnd the idea behind stocks and when they when they're in motion if they're on the way up they tend to stay on the way up which sounds really really bizarre and a lot of academics and they they shake their head and go\nOut and reduce until they go down that does it look more good diving and yeah there\nIs some effect to that but the thing is you can't utilize it to any benefit in fact there are actually studies out there and you'll hear active managers talked about this all yeah oh yeah active management adds value\n[noise] yeah but guess what the the price that you pay for the active management in terms of trading and management fee\nIt makes the alpha zero in other words there's no additional return to be had none whatsoever through and there are multiple studies that show this\nAnd ah the employer looks at me and goes oh and Paul what do you recommend [laughter]\nAt that time I'm going to tell you guys I did not have an academic around and not have an academic background on investing topics and did not know in you know as a broker and you think\nYou as a broker you're taught all of this stuff no no ... we were not tall we're taught how options were priced\nA really complicated stuff I mean there were a lot of really in depth topics that we were taught to get our series licenses but you know really the academics of investing putting ... that was not in there\nIt was here here are some things that you need to know and then when you went for training\nWhoever your investment company was that you worked for they were basically training you how to sell stuff right that was primarily it\nAnd I'll never forget the employer looking to make up what do you think

looking at using investments for my clients and I don't know what criteria to use what would you suggest\nAnd and these investment advisors were answering the question on the block\nAnd they're like well you dummy use past performance what do you what else would you use and [laughter] and\nWow you're really goes ebbs and um it made a comment somewhere along the line about how we were we started out we all started out there where we all started out on that side\nWho where we were real smart about this and then all of a sudden you know at some point we change in for me it was like this peer funny once I really learned about the evidence behind all this yeah\nBecause just having a really data focus mind very analytical mind who just like wow this just makes sense I never have to apologize for choosing bad managers again right and so you know just to\nOr you always have to apologize for diversification though yeah well I met visitors who don't know what I'm Talking about much younger

to use this and I laughed and and ah I read the article that he said and it had that line and it\nIt was about diversification means always having to say you're sorry uh-huh because there will always be something that's knocking the lights out and something that's underperforming but the reality is you don't know ahead of time\nAnd it was talking about successful successful people know about

I think the market's going to go up and they think it's a one hundred percent proposition but the investment industry knows that you don't believe in markets timing technically what Jim was talking about something called tactical asset allocation\nAnd what you're doing is tactically moving a little bit more this way or a little bit more that way based on what you think is going to happen\nIf they really really had a bead on this thing Jim I mean they would just take all of the money out of stocks when the market was going to go down there and then put it all in cash and then when it was going to go up just put it but why did they just why don't they have just a little bit I mean you know what's there is no fuss no glory come on [laughter]\n\nYou don't live which is\nBringing them back in a while\nWell you won't have to ask for your money back to the investor ... president free\nFor you guys to learn and that's the whole idea of the more educated you are as an investor [noise]\nNot going to get it it's hard to take advantage of an educated investor don't you think\nI mean and it very hard very hard\nAnd that's the whole idea of what was that last point you had another part of that that targeted I wanted to hear what the last part welding lab at about you know when we when we were talking about how turns and he's like man I did it to you again but you said market timing it doesn't work not even in target date funds\nWho who would've thought revealed the other part of this was um do fun family objective hurt and a lot of these funds will all of these phones are built up from friends from within whatever fun family is providing the target date fund and then what this report talks about is there a body of research\nSuggested fund managers tend to make investment decisions that help fund family objective so they're trying to they're making decisions that benefit the company at at the expense of lower returns for shareholders have\nSeen it they see the fun they want to get some money in that fund and they will seeded with money because it has to go in that fun if somebody's using the target date fund and\nThey started late later in this in the in the article first target date fund managers tended to favor start up a ... which had substantially lower returns over the next three years then alternatives with in their ... family so that's exactly your point\nYeah you don't want the one the most bizarre study I ever saw\nWas regarding find and what what they did or did they did is they had these multiple phones ... and the fun family was start up multiple funds these were not public funds mind you right there was set up these multiple funds and they were seen it with money\nAnd then what would happen is the only say that for funds and they find a B C and D and let's say that fun be had a greater return than a C. or D. and had better better returns ... okay equity mayor [laughter] it was like looking\nAround the freeway so one be\nHad a higher returns or what they would do is they would shut a C and D down and they wouldn't make be public right and they were able to use the performance of fun being marketing even though it wasn't a public fund\nIrene dad to me I'm telling you that this study goes back Twenty years you know in in ... and\nStill happens it's just a practice that still goes on and we always teach every month when we do our workshop yup about survivorship bias yes so what does that well you know if you want to um if you want to make your fun family look really really really good\nThen what you ought to do is have hundred's maybe even thousands in so many instances fun families have hundreds at least of different mutual funds and dozens in the same investment objective owning large us stocks for example\nAnd the reason they do that is because they know that some of those funds are going to do well some aren't going to do so well and if they have a couple\nThe funds that do well just just do the luck\nThan they can go and market those things to the public and say hey look how good we are\nThat's the absolute same tactics that use in stock picking newsletters so so newsletters that are just going to tell you pick the stock over that stock and yeah sports betting\nSports betting services where people will call up and say okay who's gonna win between you know Washington in Philadelphia and they'll tell half the people Philadelphia have people Washington yep and then the next week they give them as somebody wins and comes back for another victim they give me another\nPhiladelphia versus New York and then they say well we think New York is going to win and ...

pointed out that video\nAnd I'm sure the video had all kinds of great reasons why you needed to own GE stock yup and those that follow the news at all no that gee isn't even part of the Dow anymore that's how bad the performance is that it didn't get below five ever ah no I don't remember I remember like ... all I remember something neighborhood\nKorea I mean so you know fifty three dollars a

it and multi your standard deviation was you know if you've ever talked about standard deviation was maybe three years at at most\nIf you are halfway sophisticated but you know most people don't even do talk about that right you know a level of volatility this portfolio might be a stand deviation for those who don't know that's the way of measuring the risk of a portfolio and ... and it's interesting because you can look at a portfolio and you know\nIn a given year you know like for example one of the things that this guy said too because he was talking about having an and myself are they the guy was just talking about he made a comment regarding the um uh you know you know as a portfolio always going up I I Know I've got to be able to make more money\nWith you guys as is his comment and right going you know Joan ever you've got to look at time arises when you invest you know if I have a time horizon of less than a year for investing do not\nGo and put your money in stocks right it it doesn't make any sense to do that\nYes there is a three quarter shot that it could be\nUp at the end of the year but there is that one quarter shot and if you really need that money you really shouldn't be taking that risk in my humble opinion of ... of the stocks being down exactly now what happens is you have a time horizon you might have a one to three or time horizon I mean you could make a case for putting some stocks and the portfolio not a lot\nBut some are you know if you're looking at three to five year time horizon before you're going to spend the money you can make a case for holding a little bit more stocks\nAnd then you would in the one to three years' time arrive you can make a case if it's you know six to nine years that you might be mostly stocks because historically speaking if if we diversified properly and we have all these different areas of the market the chances are you being up after six to nine years extremely high\nChance the breaking even extremely low\nBut you know you always look in terms and what you're always doing as an investor is you're trying to maximize expected returns forgive a level of volatility you can put up with and you know the interesting thing is there's a tremendous amount of academic research about how to do that that goes routinely ignored\nFrom an industry that just looks at past performance is hey this fun at the best performance by five year period\nRight yeah and it's frustrating oh yeah the uh you know after I\nWas finally caused me to ultimately leave the dark side mhm was after some experiences with the large firms and so forth realized that wasn't working and that I couldn't pick funds and so forth\nBut maybe somebody could and so uh at the time a large research company was coming out with a portfolio\nA platform for advisors happen to be headquartered in Chicago ... people have lots of stars I think I Know who they are yes and uh so\nStarted using that service I'd gone up to Chicago went through their process and so forth from the great you know they've got all the research and seven weeks after the first time I had used that portfolio\nWe get this email ... back when email was a big deals like honey I got an email today you know me as you noticed now you're [laughter] that was it was only a hunting and email and they were getting our two males were getting rid of diamond loss edge fun and or replacing it with you know X Y Z mind mhm\nBecause of ex right I'm thinking well why didn't you by X Y Z fund three years ago and not hold on his great already you know and uh I mean that was my a ha moment was OK if these people can't do it mhm\nThen I'm pursuing something that can't be done I've got to go a different direction right right and fortunately I did\nA lot of times what happens is that you'll have a market downturn for a few years for example and then all of a sudden you know real estate became very very attractive and you know two thousand three two thousand and for all of a sudden people can get enough he started talking about the state because it didn't go down with technology stocks\nIn two thousand two thousand one two thousand two and by the way there are stock asset categories that did you know fine during that period of time a value stocks in two thousand you know the first year at the tech bubble burst thing went up ten percent\nNext year they you know I'm not much they would have like three to four percent but they went up and then small companies you know shut up about thirty percent but\nYou know the thing was that nobody was talking about those ethic categories in the late nineties right you know all they could talk about where were you know large gross companies\nWell and then what what the industry does your ... circling back to our wholesaler kind of a thing yeah is now real estate's doing well Mm wholesaler comes out and says you know if you had ten percent and real estate your portfolio would have done ... the last year I only with ten percent\nAnd Mr advisor\nThis limited partnership pays seven percent commission to I mean just so I'm feeling like wow I can do better for my clients\nAnd help my seven percent right and it's not an evil thing exact okay we're not making it more value statement about the people in the industry it's the model itself and so all of a sudden people move into something that's doing well\nAnd then it's kind of liquid you know I mean just the cycle perpetuates itself but clients are just caught in the middle that yeah\nAnd and you know a lot of times what people do is they I've I've heard advisors go well you know there's this product out there and it guarantees you can't go down and gives you some upside of the market and my client wants it why shouldn't I offer it to them\nRight and it's you know the reality of it is is is you know when when somebody says I can give you return and there's no risk I I often hearken back to if the insurance company says that they can give you return with no risk they're using your money\nAnd they're paying you to use your money and they're telling you that they're going to pay you a high rate of return to use your money hey either they're really dumb and they don't realize that can use your use your money at a lot lower price or\nThey're misleading sometimes it's not the advisor are misleading you it's it's their their employer who's telling them to sell this product and the advisors holy on aware because they're not that well trained exactly and that's that's the problem\nAnd he had this whole thing where the insurance industry was just by shutting down the use of indexed annuities and investment news the beginning of this month comes out with this article saying indexed indexed annuity sales grow among wire houses I be days and I I think\nIt's as former intern at first they're they're they're demonizing these products and see this is terrible this is terrible this is terrible and then look and go oh wait a minute these guys are salt making a lot of money selling this stuff maybe we're missing out almost fear of missing out they're missing\nOut on the big gravy train of the indexed annuity sales and now they're deciding that hey death the fiduciary rule\nThat I was gonna say that's that's why you have a spike in\nYeah we don't have to keep your best interests at heart anymore and in in its market I mean if you look at they've got a chart in this article showing how much they've spiked and it's\nIt's significant it is a significant jump in sales and this product\nNow that the whole fiduciary rule is just dead unfortunate following player listening to the investor coaching show right here we are talking to you know an seven WGN we'll be back right after\nOur veterans were there

booth [laughter]\nRight [laughter] right [laughter] oh my goodness so funny [noise] All right so are you like or love getting these taxing so let's talk a little bit about energy or tax planning\nYeah and some of the things that you're that you think of towards the end of the year uh I I actually had a a topic you know not too long ago talking about you know giving\nIt you know in a state planning instead of naming the charity in your will you know maybe having a charity inherit\nDeer and knew a tea or something that is often Gary Gray strategy I had a very bad thing to inherit ... uh from attack standpoint so human yeah yeah if you're handling exactly\nA great for charities bad for you [laughter] talk talk a little bit about you know charitable giving so you know some of the strategies for IRAs and things\nSo we're you know we're kind of coming into the the fall getting into the you know last quarter of the year ... and of course we're always talking with clients about making sure they get to require minimum distribution if they're over Seventy and a half or out of their IRA because no one wants to fifty percent excise tax mhm\nUm but you know the one of the things that was made permanent in the law change last year was this concept of making a charitable distribution from your IRA mhm as part of your required minimum and distribution Japan in the neck you had to sit there and wait are they gonna do it right and we knew it they're going to renew it\nFinally so we've been processing a lot of those yeah ah for a client or a strategy and yeah I mean it's just wonderful and so basically so explain to people don't know if you haven't taken your distribution dishes out there okay but here's the deal with it and if it up and explain it\nPeople itemize versus people using the standard deduction 'cause maybe for\nCars on the show is some of it has to do with the taxation period and I'll I'll touch on that but it also affects Social Security so even if you weren't itemize ing before mhm\nThey're still benefits to that yes so let's let's just say that ... you know you have to take let's just say you have to take twenty thousand dollars out of your IRA mhm\nAnd you only want to be you and your typically giving ten thousand a year to charity or you just use those numbers\nPreviously if you take twenty thousand out of your IRA and it runs through your fingers\nEven if you you know the duct ten thousand dollars maybe off your tax return if you itemize them it affects the taxation on potentially your medical insurance expenses the taxation on your Social Security and all those kind of thing yeah\n'cause it gets part a provisional it was part of your in your part of your income mhm if you take a charitable distribution and just send ten thousand directly to the charity mhm and the check is made out to the charity from your IRA doesn't run through your pause you might mail it to them you know but that wasn't made out to you okay\nThen that ten thousand just doesn't even show up on your tax return and so now instead of even needing to itemize I still get that folded option I get my full standard deduction\nI still don't show the income on my tax return now it lowers my provisional income ... now maybe none of my Social Security is taxed and various things I mean it's just yeah a lot of tremendous advantages the only downside is the government gets less revenue\nAnd people don't think about it that you can lose your charitable deduction when you're using the standard deduction because it's not part of it so yeah you know that's it's a win\nSo it's just kinda yeah just kind of a win win it's you know the downside is you have to sign a form typically freer provider to make the distribution of the charity small price to pay to distant here at the IRA sure that you know straight to them no problem with that yeah exactly so that's just something to be aware of is we kind of get in towards year end\nBut along the same lines something that a lot of times parents don't think about ... you know 'cause here we're talking about you know people that are over Seventy and a half were you know that's the grandparent stage\nA lot of parents have been making college visits their children are maybe starting to get acceptance letters are filing their declaring they want to go to the school or that school all the FAFSA and your ability to collect student aid for your child for college\nIntegrates very tightly with your tax return for the previous year so right now if you have particularly if it's your first child or maybe now you'll have two kids in college\nSome of your year in tax planning is going to affect\nHow much financial aid you qualify for next year next September when your kid child goes to school um and so there's some things that you just want to be aware of if you're maybe looking at selling a piece of rental property you know not typically you're home because we get so much we can exclude so much game that's not a big deal\nUm but if you're going to have a large business transaction ... you might want to put that off until January mhm admittedly this is just shifting into when there are a sophomore right you get it going to end up a a ... year waste that he aware of these things you may not even want to do it but at least think about it don't do it automatically ... what\nYou know if you look at the statement you can always at least start with Googling and fat from just still in business right or if not who bought them you know there's been a lot of financial change only the last you know Seventeen years shorter Tovia bought this and Wells Fargo acquired by you know I mean just there's a lot of changes\nBut you know somebody called the registrar and the transfer agent mhm does\nKeep track of all that stuff that's ... that to me there at ten years the unsung heroes of the invent I and I and you say that but you know I always tell people that one of the beauties of you know what\nMakes an economy run is that you have people that protect your property rights right and they will make sure you get what is yours and that to me is an unsung\nHero I agree you know what I mean the and I look at the police I look at at at the you know people that are in the jobs that do this time I look at military and I I think you know what makes you know what makes America and capitalism around the world run as property rights protection it's S. it's is you cannot over emphasize that\nAnd that's really nice so you had some that you couldn't even find the did you ever track it down or\nNot yet I mean these are still works in progress so in three months or so we'll all frankly let you know how it turned out but in a couple of these we were able to call the record keeper ... and that's usually what the qualified planned ... you know if you have a four one K.\nWe looked at the company we are able to track that they were still in business right and uh so we're trying to reach the people there in the human resource department to track it down because the record keeper didn't have a record of my clients social you know they couldn't find the account wow so we're still going through one way\nUm but it was this other Klimt it's actually a custodial account that we're looking at\nAnd so now that's actually in the you know their child's Social Security number technically yeah um but there's a few things you can do if you find the number one you know you can try to track down the investment firm mhm um one thing you can do is the IRS God Bless them has a phenomenal\nRecord keeping system\nAnd so you can contact the Internal Revenue service\n... you know once they verify your identity and so forth or you could use something called the ... one that is not an area I ever would have thought of that country is you know if somebody was sending ten Ninety nine for nine years you know to this Social Security number ...\nThey'll have a record of that meant so you could at least track down okay when did that\nStop you know did you quit getting ten Ninety nine and two thousand five you know what happened so that's one source is give them the information and see what's in your tax transcribe ... um\nThere's also you could go to this tendency and claimed property department you know if you just Google that's what I've heard on playing properly Tennessee or the state you might have lived in California Indiana whatever\nA you put in some information and they can find out if there's property in yours or your child's ... name you have to put in that you know that tax information ultimately\nUm but that's one way to find out [laughter] some of these may be so old that they have she did back to the state\n... I'm I frankly don't know tendencies achievement rules or you know that's why attorneys have jobs but\nRight um you know if any civil dis the ownership just reversed the state potentially um but it's just been you know so we are going to\nTry to track these down but most people don't think you know they might know about the unclean property thing they wouldn't think to contact the IRS to get a history of\nWhat's been presented for you or your son for ten Ninety nine and when did that end yeah you can give 'em a range of years yeah I'm frankly you could give you a tax person power of attorney to do for you that make costs you more than ... work\nDo you ever gone to a 'cause I've had people say that they've actually gone and looked and they found assets\nI have I've found assets for me yeah um I'd found ... years ago like an old insurance commission yeah Indiana you know and as you know it was like six hundred bucks but at least ... people doing it um I've actually found um for me as well this was like an old gas utility deposit\nYou know that I made when I Move I don't think I've heard several times ... like yeah OK whatever\nAnd so um so I Would encourage you to put your information and you can get it and I'm Glad you find you it's a kind of good to do on them you know snowy day if we ever have a snow day down the road ... did you really say that little unclean property while your kids are home from school [laughter]\nThat's interesting now a one last thing I was I was going to talk about the you know I you know I've heard I've seen a lot of talk about safe stocks uh-huh and there was an interesting article in investment news about a safe stocks bike alarming Wall Street\nA demand for defensive asset cast shadow over Bull Run was was the ... you know folks when somebody is out there marketing something to you and saying this is a safe asset\nYeah typically what they're doing say given in have been you know like the wrong dip it in his drawings or something like that remember that just because a stock has a strong David in history does not mean at all that they will continue I yeah I've seen companies with a strong evidence paying histories be so scared of stopping their evidence\nThat they were literally start borrowing money\nTo pay that evidence oh wow which puts them in huge financial risk\nAnd you know so that's one thing and you know I've had this I've had a bunch of these types of conversations over the past couple of weeks where people say you know this guy is recommending that I invested in stocks I pay dividends and and I have to point out I go okay dividends are a subset of earnings guys you know\nThey have it in this part of your earnings if the dip it in this high compared to well it's party earnings but it's going be high compared to what\nAnd I tried to get the kind of say well share price the price of the stock very good if the devastation is high compared to the share price and markets are really good at pricing stuff properly you have to ask\nYourself why the price the stock is low\nThe price of the stock is low why because the companies could be in distress do you think it really makes a lot of sense for you to go buy a bunch of stocks in companies that are in financial distress\nA lot of marketing it was just a lot of marketing and I guess that's for me that's a big thing about this industry there's always so much marketing going on you know for was hiding\nThe truth you know there's nothing wrong with pursuing value stocks as a group of absolutely understand okay that's a risky category and I'm expecting to get compensated for that risk yeah don't chase what you think is a safe dividend\nWhich really is chasing a risky asset category yeah oh I remember going through it with your eyes open\nHowever I talked to walk into my office one day than a dear friend and climb for many many years but\nI'll never forget the day he walked in my office with a book in his ...\nIs the first time you've ever having any comes in and he's got this kind\nDogs of the doubt that you've had this guy a while yes [laughter] you know as\nQuite a while her or\nHim you know we got lots of

parts\n[noise] All right when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible to them that's right and twenty six Tina drone\nIt was in two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX\nWhat does that collusion has actually occurred All right Kevin poor man he's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division and he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer they he arrived at isn't very reassuring his group is able to launch things that high rates of speed so it was able to simulate a crash using the right wing of loony am twenty plane and then a drone\nWith a DJ I fandom to quad copped urge to point one pounds and then he had the biggest air cat in his lab could actually handle so the banter wasn't certain to his forty foot cannon released at a speed up two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object and that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like a spoof through chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video can actually see\nThe drone go into the aircrafts wing explains that the drone traveled deep enough into the wing to damage its\nMain weight bearing far in other words the aircraft would crash\nAnd let's now turn to something even more frightening yes Facebook that's right I told you last week about the
