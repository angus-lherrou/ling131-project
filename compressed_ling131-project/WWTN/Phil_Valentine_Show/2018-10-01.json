Ford's husband claims to recall but she had done it by judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve at that point judge\nKavanaugh his name was widely reported in the press has a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election\nIn any event it to a doctor for over Thirty years to me her statement believe disclosure of abuse\nCommon so this is not the positive or this positive when speaking number three when speaking with her husband she changed her description of the incentive to become less specific she testified that she told her husband about a a sexual assaults\n\nTold her husband a sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post that she informed her husband that she was the victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage\nShe testified that both time she was referring to the same incident number four she has no memory of key details of the night in question details that could help corroborate her account I was watching a video\nAnd it was some woman screaming at somebody and you know they're all out there protesting and screaming and everybody says we have cooperation her memory now some of you have sent me a video of this woman and I watched it over the weekend and I can't remember the name right off and\nShe was given a Ted Talk she's done extensive research into fake memories\nNow you remember when this thing first came out about Dr Ford and I said one possibly remember I told you about some of these fathers who actually went to jail because they went through\nThis um reconstructive memory therapy and their daughters came out the other side and said yes he sexually abused me and then they send the guy off to jail and redefined later that the daughters we can say that really didn't happen that was suggested to me by a therapist this is a real problem\nAnd this particular scientist who's been studying this now for I don't know how long decades she's written numerous papers on this she says the very real thing the power of suggestion\nThey did experiments with people and uh the little things like telling them that they were attacked by a wild animal\nAnd like forty percent of them then when you ask them would give you a vivid description of being attacked by a wild animal even though they never were is one of those things where we are talking about a memory how many of you folks can remember back thirty six years ago or whenever it was\nNow I can remember is a lot of things from thirty six years ago but I Would not trust my memory now I Know you're in a role that tape if I ever have to go to court and I'm just telling you thirty six years ago is a long time ... you don't understand this is a traumatic experience well yeah if it's a traumatic experience\nI've told you about some of my minor traumas of getting in trouble as a youth and I remember where I was when I got in trouble but I remember the details I remember where it was I remember who was with me\nAnd I can tell you if I were to call these guys right now they would always him and I remember that oh yeah boy am she has none of that she can't\nTell you where she was she can't tell you exactly what it was now I don't fault her for that because some of these things that I've done or gotten in trouble for I couldn't tell you exactly\nWhen it was I can give you a ballpark of when it was high school or certainly after I became sixteen so that narrows it down to about a year and a half in high school because I'm a young for my grade\nBut I can certainly tell you where it was take exactly where I was in who was with me and they couldn't corroborate the stories she can do none of that\nNumber five Dr forwards that counted the alleged assault has not been corroborated by anyone she identified as having attended including her lifelong friend and I'm yeah I'm I'm On this\nTeam here today because I think it's important I went back and watch some of the testimony that I missed when I was driving in because they came back from different breaks and I was getting bad linked to the radio station in between so that I could watch the rest of it but I miss some of it\nAnd I miss this I missed\nFord Dr Ford talking about this legal in Kaiser woman and her recollection of it and she actually was texting back and forth with this woman days before\nNow that sounds like witness tampering to mean\nCan you imagine if judge Kavanaugh said well I was texting back and forth with mark judge you were texting with mark judge what are you trying to get your story straight all they would never let it go\nHas anybody even question that this woman was texting one of the principals involved that's giving a statement as to whether it happened and why was she texting her\nWell I Would ... peanut those text messages to find out what they were saying\nI don't know what they said apparently didn't do anything to sway the ultimate outcome of the testimony because the woman the legal in Kaiser woman says I don't remember it but I Believe you\nSo I don't remember it but I Believe you know you can say well that's okay but then she says I don't remember ever even meeting Brett Kavanaugh\nSo none of this is adding up\nNumber six Dr Ford has not offered consistent account of the alleged assault\nAccording to her a letter to Dianne Feinstein she heard judge Kavanaugh mark judge talking to each to two other party Gore's downstairs\nWhile she was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she couldn't hear them talking to anyone in her letter she says I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other persons of the house we're talking with them\nThan cabin on mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so the people down stairs couldn't hear the screens and I explain this to you\nYou would probably hear the screens over a stereo in the same room you may not here to the stereo was on wide open downstairs but you would certainly hear it over a stereo in the room\nI get into the tractor and have you ever been around somebody that's on a tractor and somebody walks up to him you can hear everything they're saying because they're screaming over the over the loud tractor\nAnd you did you jog down there\nBut if the tractor were next to you you wouldn't be able to hear anything they were saying so if the loud music was where she was her screens would be heard over the music and I would assume people would come running\nShe said there was no music on nothing there was silence downstairs find it hard to believe\nAccording to the Washington Post account of her therapy notes there were four boys in the bedroom\nWhen she was assaulted she told the Washington Post the notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter to Feinstein she says me and for others were present at the party and her testimony she said that there were four boys in addition to legal in Kaiser and herself\nShe couldn't remember the name of the fourth boy and nobody's come forward or they wouldn't be coming forward because\nIt didn't happen apparently\nAnd then she listed Patrick PJ Smith as a bystander enter statement and the polygraph test and then they're July sixth text of the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call them a bystander she didn't list Leland Kaiser even though they're good friends\nCleveland Kaiser's president should have been more memorable than PJ Smith\nAnd then number seven\nDr Ford struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations and their testimony regarding recent events rains is further questions about our memory\nShe struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post she couldn't remember if she showed a full or partial set of therapy notes the Washington Post reporter she doesn't remember whether she showed the post reporter the therapists notes her own summary of the notes\nNow these are you\nSaying well this is mine is no if I've got notes from the therapist and I'd say well this ... these are the notes I Would know if I gave it to a reporter or whether I'd just summarize them for the reporter I Would know that\nBut she doesn't know that\nShe said in her first what's app message to the post that she had therapy notes talking about the incident when she contacted the post tip line she testified that she had reviewed her therapy notes before contacting the posed to determine whether the mention whether they mention anything about the alleged incident but she couldn't remember if she had\nOn evenly and not nearly long enough\nAnd that leads to serious health problems so I decided to do

over the line you'll be the judge you\nThere's a lot of other stuff to talk about though Rachel Mitchell you remember her she's the Maricopa County prosecutor that specialized in sex crimes\nWell she sent a memo to the Senate Republicans and check this out five pages obtained by the Washington Post\nCites a number of inconsistencies and Dr Ford this testimony on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary committee and explaining why the allegation would not be sufficient to bring criminal charges absent corroborating evidence\nOr he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove she wrote but this case is even weaker than that Dr forwarded an invite other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations are failed to corroborate them\nFor the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Senate Judiciary committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard or\nPeople would be all they'd be screaming that would be enough to get him off the confirmation that would be enough to disqualify him in the eyes of all these liberals out there but yet we have Dr Ford who was by our own admission under oath in testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee\nWas texting back and forth with a legal in Kaiser over the last few days a key witness\nWho could either corroborate or not her story why would you be texting back and forth with her well she takes me first\nAnd I would just ignore the tax if I'm sitting there is somebody who is a key witness or not a key witness and accuser up somebody and a key witness contacts me\nI Would tell the Senate Judiciary committee immediately that this woman contacted me and I did not contact her back\nAnd then show them the text message of what she may have said in the text message but they're going back and forth and Leland Kaiser saying I Believe you I Believe you but I Can't remember any of this [laughter]\nI Can't remember going to a party like this I don't know that I ever met Brett Kavanaugh do we need to see those text messages will the FBI investigate those text messages\nThat is something I'm worried about that they won't do and if you're the president of the United states and you have the ability to sort of guide this investigation\nI'd call up Chris Wray over there and say Chris you know I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job but this woman under oath said she was talking with one of the witnesses days prior to her testimony don't we need to know what they were talking about\nSeeing that they were sitting there story straight\nOr if Dr Ford was urging her to tell it her way do we need to know this\nI think is highly unusual you folks who were in the law business will notice when you've got an accuser and a witness and the witness is getting ready to take the witness stand and the accuser in the witness have been communicating back and forth prior to her testimony that's problematic to say the least\nNot to mention all the inconsistencies and Dr Ford story which I Hope the FBI is going to investigate that when did she have the renovations done she said she did this because of the cabin on nightmares in twenty twelve the Palo Alto records show they did the renovation and two thousand eight four years before that we\nAlso

T. S. D. is she said then why didn't she tell her therapist who the culprit was\nRarely have her husband's testimony Oh yes she told me\nWell I I don't think that that's a valid piece of corroboration and even if she did tell him again her telling the story over and over again is not corroboration in of itself\nBut we'll see I just think it's going to turn out really good for Kavanaugh by the end of the week my wife thinks he's going to be going to drop him I think they're going to confirm him will see one eight hundred six one ain't Phil we're back into [noise]\nHave right well we'll give you all the information you need to start your day Nashville's morning news on super talk Ninety nine seven\nKnow what women don't like about automotive repair shops\nAnd they treat you like you're dumb about cars\nWouldn't want my wife go into a place like that\nThat's why I built my place\nI'm Aaron ... owner of euro fix\nWe built our auto repair centers around what women like super clean facilities no restrictions on talking to repair technicians and no repair over charges because you're a woman\nCause the eight for for euro fix\nWere open Monday to friday or visit your affects online dot com\nAsk any dentist and they will tell you must have us brush our teeth too hard\nOn evenly and not nearly long enough\nAnd that leads to serious health problems so I decided to do something about it\nI'm Simon and other and I intend to quit the modern electric toothbrush to help you have fresh breath pristine teeth and excellence or hygiene\nAs a product designer I care about how your toothbrush looks fails and the quality of every brussel\n... has a lightweight and seek design\nSimple time pipe rations and guiding pulses for puff the two minute clean\nAnd unlike other high into that she toothbrushes quit stop that just twenty five dollars\nBuzzfeed cools off the iPhone of toothbrushes at time magazine named is one of the best inventions of the year stock brushing better with quip\nGo to get quip dot com slash benefits right now and get your first refill tax free with a quip electric toothbrush that's your first refill pack free at get quip dot com slash benefit spelled G.

bipartisan bill for the twenty Seventeen paid family leave law and last year he successfully sponsored legislation that strengthen Washington sexual assault protection orders\nYou also co sponsored legislation to create a bill of rights for sexual assault survivors that bill got a public hearing in the Senate law and justice committee but it didn't advance lawmakers of both parties as well as governor Jay Inslee a green favors allegations should be investigated\nNo details about an investigation might perceive we're not clear\nThe governor believes is a very serious allegation that unquestionably deserves a full investigation by law enforcement officials says an Inslee spokesman\nIn the state ... state Senate majority leader sharing notes and a Democrat so the allegations deserve serious consideration in a manner that respects the dignity of all involved\nWell let's let's go back to the preponderance of evidence and all we have now is her statement so she says this guy a tour her dress off and then she relented and then he raped her and then she asked for a kiss goodnight [noise]\n[noise] that's the evidence is she's putting forward\nI don't know and I don't know if it was more evidence out there that sounds rather fishy to me\n[noise] you know what I think we have now and said guys can't do this how many have you guys have\nBeen sexually involved in one night stand you woke up the next morning regretted\nAnd show of hands out the guy\nWas nothing you can do about it\nBut if you're a woman and you have a some regret even years later you can say you know that I think he raped me\nI didn't want to have sex with him I was drunk and this is where we come from um what is that thing that was going around in California that they um yes means no or no means Yasser yes whatever it was yes means now is that what it was yes means no what the heck is that\nThat's when you know your upside down to well I said yes but I didn't mean it I meant no and so I was raped no time out and now I'm Sorry\nWe're gonna have to go to boost for review on this now I'm Sorry you said yes and it meant yes and just because you were drunk doesn't mean you were raped\nAny more than it does it he was rape 'cause he was drunk hey\nYou got to people with too much alcohol they do something that may regret later doesn't constitute rape but that's where we are and to me to era folks\nAnd it's getting scary I mean you guys are now sitting there on pins and needles waiting for somebody somewhere in your past to come forward and say well he raped me 'cause I didn't want to have sex with them but I did 'cause I was drunk\nA grave how many of you Mary guys I've ever had sex sober\nYeah and things so [laughter] it's just you know it's just\nSo anytime you have sex with a woman and she's been drinking is rape is that we're we're being led to believe here\nThe FBI investigation apparently is going on we don't know exactly\nWhat they're investigating we hope they're investigating the allegations of Dr Ford and talking to the people that are Dr Ford said were there and see if we can get a bead on what really happened\nIn the meantime we need to be looking into actually what Dr Ford said but we also now have a Republican finally coming forward and saying that Keith Ellison needs to be investigated for the accusations against him\nDo you realize that the Democrats in Minnesota have already cleared him\nOh yeah there are no way we didn't see we we looked into it we didn't see any evidence they didn't look at the video the woman said she had they didn't want to see that that might change their mind\nWhether they're Republican Senate nominee in Minnesota is calling for an immediate state investigation into domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison\nBlaming the Minnesota attorney general's office his best equipped to conduct an impartial investigation ironically that the seat he wants is the attorney general Karin Housley set in a statement recent calls for congressional ethics investigation made my Keith Ellison and echoed by my opponents\nAmount to nothing more than political cover Allison will have left Congress by the time an investigation could be completed how's lay out of the allegations raise significant doubts about Keith Ellison fitness disservice Minnesota's chief legal officer\nHe's running for the attorney general's office there multiple ... multiple Republicans recent weeks of a vote the allegations against Alison the claim there is a double standard how Democrats handle misconduct claims cause to investigate Ellis income as the Democrats rally around Christine Blasey Ford\nAllison's ex wife Karen Monaghan has claimed Alison subjected her too emotional abuse which she called narcissistic abuse during their marriage she also said Allison once tried to forcibly polar off for dead while yelling expletives Allison has denied the account\nThat wasn't at the end of September said he would ask the house ethics committee to investigate the domestic abuse claims against him today is what he said on September twenty six I Am I Am announcing that I Will submit a request for the house ethics committee investigation into allegations against me raised by a former partner\nI'm taking the step now because I Am innocent and eager to see this entire matter resolved well why isn't he considered guilty until proven innocent\nAnd where the hell's the investigation where's Paul rhino on this he's the one she called for the investigation and should call for months ago when the allegations first came to the surface but there he'd sit still in Congress\nAnd he's running for attorney general of Minnesota and I doubt anything's going to come up and you know why well not only because he's a Democrat because he's black and he's moslem\nAnd that's the main part don't forget then\nSee we would we would be Islam a phobic if we went after him you see we can't we can't do that sweating that you remember this woman Julie sweat ... she's the one who claimed the um\nThis is the most outlandish of all she's the one I guess\nStarting to get these folks confused now my mind she's the one that says she went to Penn parties where there was gang raped going on and she was gang raped in one of them right in the middle of it I think probably five fifth or sixth party and they just kept coming

first two thousand one alleging the sweat ... threaten him after he broke up with her after a four year relationship\nSweat and who is being represented by Michael ... send a declaration to the Senate Judiciary committee on Wednesday claiming that she attended house parties in the early eighties where she saw cabinet mistreating women and spiking their drinks\nSo she actually saw him he's pouring alcohol or dumping quite loads into a punch bowl is that what was that what she's saying\nBy the way I'm I've been to a lot of parties you know and unless unless I'm at um I don't know like\nThe British embassy or something or my grandmother's Tea Party I don't remember a punch bowl being there all I remember is maybe a keg and some liquor bottles and a bunch of solo cups that's what I remember I don't remember there being or was it um was it a stainless steel\nThe punch bowl and everybody says you know dipping into your eyes and then what would you like another quaint little drink yes they think that when the ...\nI don't remember high school parties with a punch bowl do you does that sound right to you\nHigh school parties with a punch bowl so every time she when the ten of these parties and every time somebody broke out the punch bowl and there was all bread or were they were quite loads and the grain alcohol good good good good good good good good ...\nAnd by the way when you take a a sip of punches guy grain alcohol and it don't you know what\nI mean good grief your breath is on fire for crying out loud and what is the deal with that pineapple flag\n[laughter] may maybe it was pineapple punch may maybe that's what that was\nAs for sweat and makeup and not into political that he had not heard of the restraining order against her\nBut he dismissed it as nonetheless and accused the political reporters were attacking sweat Nick complete nonsense he says no truth to this at all her ex boyfriend fraudulent used her resume to apply for and obtain jobs and was caught by her\nWhy are you all attacking a sexual assault victims would that be appropriate in a court of law\nWell I thought he broke up with her\nIf he was ... using her resume to apply for and obtain jobs and she called him when she had broken up with him\nWell by all accounts that sounds like he broke up with her and she got hacked off about it this guy is a sixty\nThree year old

minority\nPolitical is not alone in the phenomenon the wall street\nJournal Reuters and USA Today we're also found to have no minority representation among their White House beat the Associated Press only had a single African American reporter that's a black person by the way covering the president\nPaul Farhi the reporter who compiled the analysis noted that while the amount of women in journalism is gradually approaching parity with men newsrooms have become had been less successful in racially diversifying their workplace\nAccording to surveys conducted by the American society of news editors minority journalists to kind of really sixteen points six percent of the workforce\nAnd he's Seventeen by that number is larger than the eleven point three percent they found ten years ago the population of minorities in the United states is now thirty nine percent so where\nAre they well this is the kind of mentality that leads to this California and I'm not making this up California\nHas become the first state to require publicly traded companies to include women on their boards of directors\nOne of several laws boosting or protecting women the governor Jerry Brown signed yesterday\nThe measure requires at least one female director on the board of each California based public corporation by the end of next year the companies would need to up to three female directors by the end of twenty Twenty one depending on the number of board seats so now we've got quotas\nFor the board of directors for corporations mandated by state\n\nThis is real liberalism goes violence well why isn't this good because the board of directors is about who's the best to do this what is there any women who want to be on the board of directors we make them\nAnd then that would be but that would be abused wouldn't it and\nBrown wrote in signing the statement I don't minimize the potential flaws that indeed may prove fatal to its ultimate implementation nonetheless nevertheless recent events in Washington DC and beyond make it crystal clear that many are not getting the message\nWhat is the message\nWhat's the message there Geri there we're going to force you to have people on your board of directors that you ordinarily wouldn't put on there\nThat is one of several measures affecting women the brown signed yesterday his last opportunity do approve or veto laws before the term limited governor leaves office they also approved legislation requiring smaller employers to provide sexual harassment training and banning secrets settlements related to sexual assault and harassment\nThe way where is the outcry and kind of we've asked his before where is the outcry and Congress to find out who was sexually harassing women and and having them paid off on government money\nThen I can almost guarantee the majority of them are Democrats that's the way this thing flows man that's the way it breaks\nI'm not saying that aren't there aren't any Republicans

was she already knew what she lead to the press that was what she's going to do with it and she was going to wait until right before the vote to do it so she had to have leaked it this is my

went back to the hotel and they ... their dress off and then she didn't want to have sex with him but then she relented\nAnd then after they after she says he raped her she asked him for a kiss goodnight this is her part of the testimony and I'm going you talk about exculpatory by the way Dr forward that means that you know the evidence that gets you off she didn't know she knew a lot of big

not the art of the deal when you add an F\nBut that's basically what I Am I mean I sit down and get my clock cleaned that's normally why I have to go to somebody and say can you help me with this 'cause I'm just not real good at this\nNegotiating but Trump apparently is and I've gotten burned a few times you know I mean it just happens but Trump I don't think very often gets burned because he knows say here's what he knows too\nHe knows he can walk away you never get into a situation where you can't walk away from the table you\nKnow when to hold them know when to fold them know when to walk away no one to run\nAnd he gets in these situations where\nWhat is the worst case scenario for Trump and all this what is the default\nNAFTA well we've got no it's not like oh if we don't get all this stuff then everything just goes away we've got NAFTA that's our deal he doesn't like it but he can live with it I mean if he tried to change NAFTA and didn't it wouldn't be the end of his career\nBut what he went in there saying is I hate NAFTA I think that has been bad for the United states and we want a bunch of stuff to change NAFTA and then you go in there with a bunch of things that you know you're not gonna get\nAnd then you walk out with something that is considerably better than that but even Chuck Schumer today says well I I was against NAFTA from the beginning and the president deserves credit for this and now we're gonna have to see this is Chuck Schumer we're gonna have to see the details and\nCongress is going to have to hash this out and vote on it but it looks like to me that we've got a better deal than what we had hello\nThat's how you make the deal when the default is\nYou know it it's like somebody coming in and and are saying well I Want your house and you're going well I don't want to sell my house\nAnd they said well we'll give you um will give you fifty percent more\nNo I couldn't possibly leave this house but for three times when I got in it and then they end up paying you twice and then you just walk away with a new money and if worst comes to worse\nYou just go back to your bedroom go to sleep you still got the house we still got NAFTA Trump knew this all along the worst that can happen is we're back to square one\nOn the deal we just keep going what we got and maybe we'll renegotiate next year\nIt wasn't like we were going to lose all trade with these folks but what about all these terrorists what about him yes what's coming off the tariffs these were bargaining chips this is the four hundred percent I'm Talking about and you

United States Mexico and Canada it's no longer NAFTA now this has to get approval from Congress\nAnd I think they probably will approve it even Chuck Schumer says I was totally against NAFTA if this helps the middle class then that's great\nWell I heard somebody today may NPR's somebody saying that um you know the I think forty percent of the I don't have the stance rooms or don't quote me something like forty percent of the some\nOf the car manufacturing jobs they gotta pay him sixteen dollars an hour and people were saying\nWell that's a you know that's a they were implying that he's trying to buy the votes of the middle class\nIt's not that at all let me tell you why why that is\nIt so that there's not this tendency to send your manufacturing the Mexico if Mexico has to pay a bunch of their folks sixteen bucks an hour\nThen there's no need and moving your car manufacturing outfit the Mexico thinking or get cheaper labor 'cause you're not you may as well just stay here so it's not about paying\nThe car manufacturing of people more because they're making that kind of bread it's about keeping those jobs from going to Mexico that's how you when you're dealing with a third world country that can under cut you on labor costs this is the way to do is say look if we're going to have a treaty if we're going to have an agreement a trade agreement\nThen we're going to have a trade agreement that keeps a lot of these jobs from going across the border to you because let's be honest NAFTA was a great deal from may go it wasn't so great for us\nAnd so Trump has retool this thing\nAnd he's made all sorts of demands and he's got most of it he didn't get all of it\nBut that's what you do you go in and asking for four hundred percent of what you want you end up with two hundred percent and you're happy these other folks who have negotiated the deal going with exactly what they want and they come out with half of what they want and this guy knows how to negotiate here's the deal\nThe new packed this where's this round Politico which is being called the U.S Mexico Canada agreement\nIs a major step forward to complete in one of Trump's signature campaign promises gives the president of the concrete policy when the out on the campaign trail this fall and also sets the stage for what is sure to be a high stakes fight to get the agreement passed by Congress before it can become law\nYou remember what all these folks were saying all these tariffs on our friends like Canada is is horrible why we're treating your friends on the\nUh we got a better deal well never mind\nAnd so we're getting a better deal from China we're getting a better deal from the ... you were getting a better deal\nFrom Mexico and Canada and everybody we're dealing with because this guy knows how to play hardball\nTrump Administration already formerly notified Congress at the end of August of its plans to sign a new pact and face the deadline of the end of September to provide a draft of the agreement which have done so am I now have us trade representative Robert Lighthizer set in late August\nThat officials are planning to sign with their Canadian and makes a counter Mexican counterpart at the end of November a date that would also satisfy Mexico which is eager to have current president Enrique Pena Nieto signed a deal before his successor takes place\nA that's old Brittany Obrador you remember him he won that'll happen December first it's a great win for the president and the validation for his strategy in the area of international trade a senior administration officials send them to call with reporters\nPeople briefed on the outlines of a revamped deal described changes in language governing dairy imports you remember that Trump was saying they got a three hundred percent a tariff on it it well they don't know none of this goes through\nDispute resolution between the country's limits on online shopping that can be done tax free and limits on the U.S threat of auto tariffs prime minister Justin Trudeau said as he left the office late Sunday night it's a good day for Canada so everybody's feeling good about this thing\nNow watch the Democrats tried to screw it up because they're going to try to screw it up so he doesn't have something to brag about come the mid term elections a formal vote in Congress won't be held until ... next year\nAnd it is still an open question whether lawmakers including members of the president's own party who have often clashed with him on trade will fall in line to support the deal I think now that they've seen\nThe ah madness of his methods and they see what we're going to get out of this I think they're going to definitely fall in line lawmakers from both parties along with powerful business and industry groups\nAre also examining whether new provisions such as a stricter automotive rule may end up making life more difficult for domestic companies rather than easier\nA senior ministry official highlighted the great result on dairy issues that was achieved\nThis pack opens up the Canadian dairy market to us exports at a level higher than the three point two five percent market share the Obama administration negotiated under the Trans Pacific partnership you remember um Trump got out of the uh the TPP and people were\nSaying oh my God I was you know we've got a better deal oh okay we've got a better than\nThe official also said the candidate agreed to eliminate a recent milk ingredient pricing program that us farmers complain to drive up demand for their exports of the product\nAnd exchange Canada was able to preserve dispute settlements language Canada has historically insisted on an international handle the judge whether the U.S improperly used his duties as a commercial weapon\nCanada also agreed to a an accommodation do it's auto exports and response to tariffs Trump's expected to impose on vehicle imports for national security reasons\nThat arrangement is going to likely involve Canada agreeing to assign be you'll that would restrict its auto exports to a level well above the current volume of training that flows south of the border Lighthizer\nAnd hope to reach an agreement by the end of last year a timeline that was extended until the end of march the three nations failed to make that deadline but they had been meeting almost continuously\nIn
