U. I. C. K. to Seventy nine Seventy nine Seventy dog reads\nHenderson bail Nashville\nStudio audience I mean I [noise]\nIt's three o'clock I'm Pamela for with your top story they suspected explosive devices has been nailed down high profile target list includes former President Obama and Hillary Clinton former attorney general\nEric Holder New York democratic governor Andrew Cuomo Florida democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and California congresswoman Maxine Waters and just moments ago the president saying we will spare no resources in the investigation he also said\nA suspicious package address to Maxine Waters of California intercepted by Capitol Hill belief a suspicious package also male to former U.S attorney general Eric Holder remains unclear weird that package was found\nAnd we have a I think they they they said earlier today there were two at Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nDid the return address for all of these was Debbie Wasserman Schultz which is very strange to I doubt she sent him I'm just\nSaying they put her return address on their cell are coming up thirty five after we've got sheriff David Clarke going to talk about the human caravan that's coming up from\nHonduras on its way through Mexico and there's a second wave coming as well or the president was addressing this this bomb incident that day at the White House he was actually doing a I Believe a press conference on opioids and uh he had this to say about that\nWe have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence on any kind have no place in the United states of America\nSo you go on Twitter and are believed to hashtags\nIs hash tag mega bomber so that's what the left as on Twitter calling this the mega bomber ladies and gentlemen and they're all over the place see this is what happens when you use some of the rhetoric like the president used and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd then nobody to blame the Democrats for the guy that shot Steve's beliefs while yelling that they need to do something about healthcare\nNobody at all blaming the Democrats were that\nMichelle mark and tweeted this for all of those recklessly in gleefully tweeting hashtags mega bomber here's a cautionary tale of jumping to partisan conclusions and blaming conservative free speech for a political murder that turned out to be a suicide\nAnd she's got a link to a piece from November of two thousand nine census workers suicide the right got blamed and bloggers want an apology\nWhen census worker bill sparked when was found hanging from a tree with the word fed scrawled across scrawled across the street I remember this story some suggested\nThat conspiracy theorists on the right word partly to blame but investigators pronounce the census workers that the suicide and now lit up with the news of it's a exoneration the conservative bloggers fears demanding an apology from fellow pundits\nRobert Stacey McCain isn't about to forgive his liberal brother end anytime soon\nQuote well you biased bastards I have not forgotten about the role you played here and you will not escape blamed for your journalistic malpractice and he's naming names yes we remember all those headlines\nA yes Mr Sullivan and Mr under we remember all your irresponsible speculation that people have clay county Kentucky oh wait you're apologies\nMichelle marking at the time once an apology I'm not holding my breath she says since I raised this question eleven days ago and there's been no response but I'm not going to let go and she's looking at the Atlantic Andrew Sullivan who mark and says it's too busy nursing his tail and induced psychosis to own up\nAt reason magazine Jesse Welch\nSays it wasn't just bloggers on the left to jump to conclusions what's important was the leap to judgment a large number of commentators assumed apparently inaccurately the death was a murder the murder was political and that the motive was linked to one Congress woman's crusade\nThey made those assumptions because it fit a narrative to which they were committed when people on the left or on the right to do that\nThey're accused of paranoia or being so eager to connect the dots that they run ahead well the evidence actually says that the sad story from Kentucky be reminded of the establishment is just as capable of making this mistake as the fringe\n[noise] so we will find out we have a ... at this point absolutely no idea who was behind this now at first blush\nYou can assume oh there's some craze right wing not out there who hates George Soros some guy probably listening to the film Valentine show got all worked up about George Soros and funding the or the caravan and everything else is George Soros is done\nAnd ah and then he hates Maxine Waters coast villas talking about that too and hates Obama cause spills made fun of Obama I mean there's no telling where this ends\nAnd of course there's the Clintons naturally and then there's Debbie Wasserman Schultz is fills been on her case for a long time with the one boy so it's bound to be filled Valentine I mean at least he's got something to do with it\nI mean you know this kind of stuff is coming that specifically me I'm not a\nBig enough fish to be on their radar but you know what I'm saying it's the rhetoric coming from the right in the right wing hate talkers on TALK radio and they get these people who are already halfway crazy all the way crazy\nAnd then they make bombs and they send them out of these folks well it could be a right wing not there's no doubt about that at first blush it looks like a right wing nuts\nBut the fact to me that hey none of the bombs exploded and be they were sent to people where they know that they would be filtered through an offsite screening facility either by the Capitol police or by the secret service\nTells me it's somebody who just wanted to make a statement and it still could be somebody on the right just wanting to make a statement wanting to scare these folks wanting them to look over their shoulders everywhere they go or it could be some left wing nuts who wanted to get everybody ginned up right here before the midterm elections\nSaying see this is what Trump's rhetoric does but I Would suggest to you that with all the evidence they have and all of these bombs unexploded and still intact it shouldn't take the government officials that long to figure out who did this\nHow many of you people have access to all the bomb making material to make a bomb\nWhere you can say you can go to the hardware store but that would be an over simplification of this these were\nA crudely constructed pipe bombs and you've gotta have gunpowder and you're going to have all sorts of stuff and a lot of this stuff is traceable I mean you can find out where it came from they can find out we're certain black powder certain gunpowder is actually made the\nRight back to the the exact facility and they can trace it from there where did it go from there who had access to this and this kind of stuff [noise]\nUh we have what we we don't know when they die sec these bombs that they were actually active bombs that could've exploded they may have been things that looked like bombs to scare people who knows\nBut the fact that they're all intact and the packaging is all intact and the one at CNN came from a courier now they're not seeing it came from some official career like fed ex or UPS or something like this is just a courier\nIf they got video footage of this guy or gal or whoever delivered this thing it might be is as simple as tracing back and say who gave you this package or the career could be the person who made the bomb\nWho knows I'm sure the FBI is on it right now they're not oh let's go to lunch and we're worried about this tomorrow now they're on it twenty four seven did go to I can guarantee you they're going to track down who did this the question is how soon\nAnd if it comes before the midterm elections and it turns out to be some right wing mega guy with a ... hat oh my gosh the left wing is going to go nuts\nBut if it happens to be some left wing nuts who was trying to make a point\nThis story will go away mark my words on this if this happens to be a left wing or once we find that out you'll never hear about this story again the mainstream press oh yet Daily Caller will habit\nThe blaze Fox News will do some stories on it but it will not be on the front page of the New York times of the Washington Post it'll be all okay we we we need to get back to the murder investigation and Russia\nAh [noise] we got better things to do bigger fish to fry there's nothing to see here folks\nIf it turns out to be a ... wearing guy you'll

hashtags leading debate is hashtags mega bombers so they're already\nThe conclusion there's gotta be some right wing crazy person who was inspired by the angry rhetoric of Donald Trump\nYeah well not these outside of the realm of possibility but uh I highly doubt that I wouldn't put my money on that of course so that's going to seize on it they said nothing about the political violence or that

with a share of clerk thanks um how would you like to be President Trump's hero 'cause I got the information for you man laying on me there are documents from Congress\nUm that specifically state it's it's the USA's obligation to protect New Mexico and ... and the Arizona from invasion this\nGoes back there called ... back in the day they call them cop act but their contract\nWhen a Arizona Territory and New Mexico territory applied for statehood\nThey didn't get it the first time I had to keep free applying until they got all the ducks in a row with our constitution and everything and then finally what happens when Congress said it's OK you're accepted into statehood they don't just spit in their palms and shake hands there's a document that says you\nAre accepted as a state and as a state you are going to recognize the federal government pledge allegiance to the United states all that good stuff in return you receive all the benefits and goodies and blah blah blah and in return we will\nAlso protect you from invasion it's like one paragraph it in writing there called the cops packs and that's what that's what you got a back in the day when they accepted these two territories as a a state\nDoes in mind I don't I mean these states should be protected by the United states from an invasion and that's exactly what we're looking at\nWhat it said it specifically and you can Google it Google bought blocked now I've seen him but you can Google it if you go compact all you'll get is a compact\nUm from Arizona concerning the Colorado River and how that water is going to be a distributed so these documents exist in the library of Congress I don't have the um [noise] uh I don't have the ability to research that and get it but I'm telling you they exist\nAnd so when you start thinking about uh like in the border like here in New Mexico they're going to oh well the federal government wants to take land put up the wall or the fence or whatever [noise] um well guess what these documents will also help them with eminent domain to fulfill the obligation\nTo protect our borders it's in writing like that I couldn't you're the first one I was able to get a hold of to get this out if you could if you have the resources of the staff or somebody that can pick that up\nFor the president would love to have back because it's in writing\nNow talking notice telephone you have the same time back because of the dog will just send all these illegal to California\nWell sir I'm that's what that's what I'm going to tell you is I couldn't okay California became a state wide Eighteen forty eight or six or whatever so I couldn't I couldn't tell you about California and I can't speak to Texas but I can tell you that Arizona and New Mexico territory the compact is almost exactly the same\nAnd you're talking circa Nineteen eleven eleven Nineteen Thirteen somewhere in there when they became states\nInteresting well that should be easy to dig up shouldn't\nIt shouldn't be and once upon a time you can Google it but Google has a block that you can't get you can't get it now so somebody has to actually go pull it up from the library of Congress but they do exist I've seen them\nWhen we will ... will check their not appreciate the tip\nOh man I'll tell you what a Mr Trump would love to have that in his hands\nWhen they do yeah if they were honoring to come back we're protecting these states as we said we would\nOh it's it's his obligation to do so [laughter]\nI'm ... I'm Sorry John ... she'd the tip my friend\nBecky facts facts were less than I think you are by the way in California became a state on my birthday September ...

Mayo clinic's or nail salons every year because they have to and they hadn't spent loosely in Seventeen years and as you say it was going to the politics nobody wanted to look like they were trying to to shut down an abortion clinic and so they just limit on line and you have mass murder going on over Seventeen years\nIt's horrible you know that's where it where politically correct really gets in a way of you know justice and and and that's horrible horrible for the women who were victimized\nBy having trouble for the children were victimized by him that's just a terrible situation and the scary part of it is and that's something that obviously is an ex jumping off point from this is that how many more of those clinicians is how many more God's nails are there out there right now\nThat's exactly what went through my mind in the movie dean teen stars in God's know as I say you can find a theater near you hopefully if you're going to film at one time dot com you can click on the guns no movie logo and you'll find the theater a page and you can enter your ZIP Code and find what dean king safe travels my friend preaching to spend some time with this\nI appreciate so thank you to automate on your show thank you for having me out certain\nThings are being ...

album a new project that we were doing is really focusing on on telling our story I end the or the you know the hardships that we have gone through with abuse in the past\nAnd um but even though we do talk about that in our in our new album and we're kind of that's kind of a theme that were that were I'm addressing a you know now when I had been being in the public eye we still want to send a message of hope in a number of an uplifting message even through you know the hardships\nWhat then what does so trends were this recording we've run your father was the abuse or is there room that is correct yeah that is so sad to see if you in jail now or what\nA yes or yeah he he has a he was sentenced to forty years in prison hurry how long does\nThis go on before you know anybody figured out

come about\nTake that the man [noise] [noise]\nOh anyway it is still Valentine shall we say\nOne eight hundred six when eight fill one eight hundred six when eight seven four four or five Jeff you would be a mix Geoff what's up\n[noise] hey fill a when I first heard about the bombs being male to Obama Clinton the very first thing they come to my mind was was somebody on the left doing it because the momentum was going with the Republicans and then when I heard\nWhat you said about the bond expert describing these people were pretty much mailing the equivalent of a Warner Brothers Wylie coyote\nBig black bomb with a few sticking out of it and everything but bomb written on it you know exactly\nExactly and and the fact that you know the Clintons in Obama their Secret Service detail nothing's going to get to them so I I don't know I I honestly believe I mean like you said it could be some right wing wacko but I Am leaning real heavy this was a left the way trying to get a little charge right before the election\nThat's the first thing to me too and then\nWhen you see this you know when you see this bomb experts seeing all this I mean he says just none of it makes sense and who who stands to benefit from this and obviously you know who that is\nThey're already gonna hashtags it'd be interesting to see when that hashtags started wouldn't it magnum bomber it probably started sometime last night before they even knew about some of these things\nHappen right after the Trump rally where they were rolling out the jobs versus mobs a science and now all of a sudden boom we get this\nYeah it's interesting isn't it I mean it does seem rather coincidental\nIt sure does I friend thanks a lot I think you appreciate the phone call if you didn't hear that\nThen we everything we re tweeted that the guy didn't he is not a Web site we can link to on this but since he's brought it up if I have it again that I you know I'll I'll go through this and this is Tom sour I don't know Tom Sawyer is\nA but Tom sour is president founder of MacArthur group he's the navy he owed ... veteran and he's a bomb squad guy\nAnd he's been tweeting all day about this and it's interesting what he has to say about it as a matter of fact when mia Mm bring this up for you so few observations from former bomb disposal officer I eat me\nOne the proper ... moms don't have wires connected to both ends that's dumb to you can find timers slashed remote control receivers way smaller\nThan whatever that white boxes a proper timer would best be stored inside the pipe making it fully encapsulated that thing is just silly looking\nNumber three hoax devices are far more common than real wins in which case we should ask ourselves what the motives of the bomber are and who benefits go ahead think deeply and critically\nAnd then number for the bottom line whoever made that wanted to be painfully obvious to anyone and everyone that it's a bomb this is nearly the same as a bundle of road flares wrapped together with an old time alarm clock ticking away in other words this was not meant to go off\nThis was meant to send a message that this is a mom\nAnd I would be really curious to see if there's anything in there that could have gone off because all we've seen is the outside now I can I can check my Twitter feed on that too to see the latest and greatest from whatever's going on out there but it's going to be interesting to see one would think\nIf it's just a bunch if it's a pipe and a bunch of wires\nAnd some device it may be very hard to track what would make it easier to track and again I Know bomb disposal experts but just from reading about this kind of stuff it's the ... the bomb ingredients themselves what makes it go boom\nThat kind of stuff with a receipt for or gunpowder or whatever that's the that's the easy\nThere's stuff to track to track wires I mean good grief you could have gotten in the back of a out of the back of an old TV you know if\nThis thing was if these pipe bombs were just meant the looked like bombs and scare folks and send them to Obama and Clinton and George Soros and get the um left all ginned up thinking that the right wing coming up to kill everybody was leaving the leftist movement\nOr you could put ... you could put wires from all sorts of pipes that you can find on the side of the road stuff it with or who knows what have some wires coming out of it\nAnd you know there's your so called bomb I'll be curious to hear what the\nExperts in the FBI and the rest have to say about what was in it as an I. E. could this thing actually of going off was the gunpowder inside well there's some sort of explosive inside of it and once we find this out\nI think it would be a pretty simple thing for them when a simple but it'll be easier than just wires in a in a pipe it'll be easier for them to find out we're this thing came from who may have manufactured now what's going to happen if we find out\nThere to scenarios I mean and really only two scenarios I I think\nThat this is some crazed Trump supporter who's either trying to scare these folks are trying to blow them up\nAnd we need to figure out the you know who that person is what's gonna happen if it's the opposite what if it's some cranes left this lunatic\nThis trying to garner sympathy for the left by putting these bombs together and leaving them at the Mayo facilities or wherever the one at CNN was actually delivered by courier that looks like that would be the easiest thing to track you got cameras with the guy I assume a guy maybe girls don't\nCall me a sexist\nDelivering this device is is the person who put it together or does this guy get it from somebody who is it because we're told us not UPS has not FedEx is not the post office so who's the courier quote unquote is it a legitimate courier service is somebody went\nAnd uh and signed up dropped off a package and then paid for it\nOr is it just some guy on the street but this guy hired to go take this over to CNN\nOr you could you know pretty much followed this guy back to whoever drug won't listen he doesn't know what I'm saying is there's so many unknowns and way too early to be hashed tagging mango bomber\nYou know we didn't have a liberal shooter hashtags liberal shooter after the Steve ... shooting midway matter of fact the mainstream media to their level best\nTo downplay any of the political motivation and we knew what the political motivation was it was a craze liberal but went up there trying to gun down Republicans and they got one and fortunately he didn't kill him\nBut you'll notice it in the days weeks and months after that the mainstream ... a media CNN BS NBC all the all the rest of 'em but Fox\nWere not even mentioning this guy was a liberal\nRand Paul mentioned just a week or so ago why didn't the mainstream media tell what I told them that this guy was screaming out uh this is for health care whatever was he was saying they ignored that too and Rand Paul says I told every media outlet to want to hear it and they never put it on the air\nThat's going above and beyond the due to to to to conceal Mike in Alabama you're up next to Mike what's up\nHey Jill I'm you know back in prior to or to where it was trying to gain power and found the chancellor he set\nFire to the white building right exactly the kind of thing getting cheaper and blamed it on the economy's in white well why is it on the first try they weren't they weren't capable of doing it that people are so stupid history that they wouldn't\nTake is one out and besides what I Know about this particular bomb us why work about it it was black powder and there's no way of all these bombs no one went off at any time\nThat was my point LA and good grief I mean how many ... we had like six of these things are so and not one of them went off what's the deal with them\nNow I bet you can't keep up with something like that to draw attention away from the care of an issue and stop because that was backfiring on him and now they do that in order to try to understand even for George stores\nNow can you imagine going getting on the hill\nWith them and that never happens in this person knew it to\nYou on are running a squeaking way toward marker\n... office newly ... at most or we can't stop that noise but we can play it all the noise around and finding the right talent the noise of reps from job sites with one size fits all products you don't need in the unqualified can is filling up your inbox monsters just smart people getting to know your business and giving you a simple personalized solutions for a fair price how's that sound\nReally sounds like the opposite of this marker\n... eighty eight months or to talk to someone without noise

upset\nWhen you're a student comes home for the holiday ABC News says the day you may want to ask them about the stressors of college life classes significant others funds and the state of politics in times past we have assumed it politics a little to do with our personal\nLives however college health care providers are finding that many students are in a significant amount of distress regarding\nThe twenty sixteen presidential election and related event yeah two years later\nThere's widespread discontent with both candidates the unanticipated election outcome and heightened inner group conflict may have heightened emotional distress following the election discarded was study from San Francisco State University\nSubsequently the researchers sought to study the perceived impact of the twenty sixteen electric on close relationships\nThe prevalence of election related distress symptoms and the demographics I e race gender religion of those who reported more symptoms so this study looked at seven hundred and sixty nine college students enrolled in an introductory psychology course\nAnd have them fill out the questioning or two to three months following the presidential election in November of twenty six team\nThen the question here was validated or a violent validated psychological to use to evaluate the self reported stress related symptoms following the event and some of the symptoms to to ask about we're avoidance and intrusions associated with a stressor so here's what they found\nThe overall result was at twenty five percent of students question reported clinically significant stress symptoms related to the election\nYou need to get a life was twenty five percent a quarter of the students had clinically significant stress symptoms after Trump won this means of these students should talk to their doctors about their symptoms\nThe highest level of elections it related stress were found in African Americans and those classified as sexual minorities

I mean you know this was obviously a left wing nut who shot Steve ...\nAnd the media folks never never talked about the rhetoric of Maxine Waters or Nancy Pelosi or anybody else they just said oh well this is just some loan crazy guy has nothing to do with politics and that everything to do with politics I'm not saying that they should stop voicing their opinion if you're an agency below sea or mad magazine or any of the rest of them\nBut uh you know what's good for the goose is good for the gander if they're going to prematurely call this the mega bomber then why didn't they call that demand Maxine shooter\n[laughter] you know this is a kind of stuff that goes on especially in an\nElection cycle is close we are to the midterms are the rhetoric gets more inflamed rhetoric gets more responsible now you know people like Maxine Waters Nancy Pelosi\nClinton you know their physicians have responsibility at every huge platform and they have to be responsible and and and words matter for them to put a dog with soldiers are getting their faces and no civility until we win elections highly irresponsible\nAnd it's that sort of rhetoric for people under ... process said like everybody knows why are you and I should say we hear that we don't think that's a call to arms but many other there are people who can't thinking process\nOr they don't see it that way they see this call to arms and they act on it looking at for that one Democrat leader has condemned the antics of ... or any of these other uh crazies that um you know carry out a political violence in the lead up to me when you don't condemn it like they haven't it's tacit approval for their behavior\nNo law is even worse than that there was a couple of years ago CNN had this headline ...\nPiece through violence so I mean [laughter] peace through violent and well let's talk about the caravan just for a second too because these folks are coming I saw as a as a story yesterday\nThey say they will be here in Seventy days but as you well known you've seen the things on Twitter and the the video that people are shooting and they go they're walking through these towns where the media are and then they're jumping up on the back and flatbed trucks in Eighteen leaders and that they're being transporting the next place I think their goal is to be here by election day what do you think\nFrom all of the

see okay I see what that is [laughter]\nYeah yeah I'm trying to get some streaming or were posted in some\nSome audio this is a dean king who's been on the show today and may still be on the show today depending on when you're getting the show I mean you never get into and could be on the show tomorrow they definitely will be on the show tomorrow but dean king was on the show maybe talk about God now\nAnd so we're putting that on a SoundCloud too so you know whatever just you know listen to the show find that we have so many ways you can access this radio show it's just unbelievable absolutely unbelievable Stewart's Kansas City you're up next Stewart how are you\nA pretty good I Would prefer to but that's OK\nStu how are you\nI'm I'm pretty good hope you are too I'm super\nYou sound pretty good you know I Wish tickled if that's the right word but I Wish I was impressed to hear you use the term a sexual minorities even though you're recording something but I I I didn't know we can get away with that bitch a permanent I've used for years\nAnd I've also used the term sexual miss strips I Wonder if uh if we could still use\nThat they probably don't go from there on my resume and\nIt seems entirely appropriate I mean it pretty much wraps up a good description don't you think\nWhat do you look at selling yesterday that what you heard this\nI saw a lady with a bumper sticker on a truck and she said a proud mom of a gay student and I'm going well you know I mean I don't know what's to be proud about I mean not that you should be ashamed I'm just saying what I put proud Dan I'm a straight student on my on my car\nI just don't see that's that's the kind of mentality I don't understand so we're supposed to be proud of your of love your sexual orientation I mean why are we proud of that it's like you know I'm proud to be black which can be proud to be white well just you know these are not things you're supposed to be proud of you just are\nBoys like being proud of being a deviant\nYeah [laughter] well yeah yeah right so I don't show you know when you\nWere talking about the uh a gal who broke off a date because you know want to know who the who are\nReally voted for ...\nI used to do that you know back in the days I mean I'm old too old for this now but when I used to do computer dating and I had a profile posted a my profile\nSure um if you are a little bit more liberal progressive Democrat any of those uh you can stop breathing right now\nBecause um I don't want any part of it was not\nNo yeah I really don't but the funny thing is that I'm a normal percentage than she Gordon Liddy one of my heroes hum he once told me personally should um\nDon't ever let a political matter stand in the way of a sexual encounter [laughter]\n[laughter]\nSo what are the leaders are more or the term\nBut that was what was his message but you know I I just can't um I just can't do it I I just want you know it can't be with someone who's politics I have no respect for\nSo stew you don't go the other way huh is that where there's\nBeen voted for the other two you know\nThe funny thing is though see I'm a I'm a single guy I've never been married uh haven't\nHad imagine that a romance of my life and in many years\nAnd ah you know show on paper that's kind of suspect than I Am I'm thinking about are waging a when I have to have my epitaph written for certain you know old girlfriends to be called on to testify that um you know despite my having never married or\nYou know any of that that I really am store you know red blooded ...\nWell I Would just have this and you will do is to just put this on your tombstone I'm not gay honestly\nYeah in the in my neighborhood in New York you know if somebody called you that before we even have the term gay but you know if you if you were accused of anything like that we used to say hey your mom or your sister around and I'll show you how\nDo you know so you say that Israel yeah well you can't do that I worry because\nFans of George could stand to watch you know and the um but there's you know not that there's anything wrong with that episode\nDrove ... show didn't move it move you know he said come on do you want to have sex right now and my wife sex right now\n[laughter] prove that he said well maybe that's what you maybe that's a big on the line is when you're out you know somewhere and used to say hey you think I'm going to have sex right he uses that six right now maybe that are\nWell you know and and the funny thing is if you're if you're the guy you can get away with that just like you know Trump's comment about you know grabbing my you know that was a comment about women that if you're the right guy ... you don't even have to pretend to be a gentleman\nThat's right and that ... that was was that was the truth I mean he was telling the truth now it was not meant for public consumption that was crude but it was something that he said to Billy Bush that he never expected that anybody else who's going to hear it and you know guys tend to talk a little rough\nWhen they were just talking amongst guys and people have turned this into something like oh you did you see the guy yesterday that was so slowly grow the woman on the airline and civil Trump says you've written by the private bar ... yeah that that's the ... I live out there trying to get away with it\nBut Trump's comments actually said more about women than it said about Trump\nThat's exact it look not only women but gold digging women in Hollywood that is what he's talking about can you imagine you're worth five billion dollars how many women are throwing themselves that you know he says you you know they let you and that was the\nThat was a key part of that whole thing they let you grab them ... Heather you're up next Heather how are you\nOh I'm fine thank you um I just wanted\nTo say about that may be that that guy from the outside and honestly what struck me now wife ran that one of the race that could ball abortion planet went down there than it raining there cleaning compassionate and that and\nYou know ... ... ...\n... you had the most profound effect on me I don't want to spoil it for about ... from the navy ... on that that was a powerful\nYeah the whole look the whole thing was by foreigners\nOr if you're familiar with um if you watch the movie there is a scene in there where they show a picture to the jury now you've never seen the picture again this is not a gross movies where the PG Thirteen\nBut they show a movie or a picture in the movie to the jurors and mix or she was the director he said those reactions were real because they had never seen the picture before and we wanted\nTo get them on film their\nFirst on his reaction so what you're seeing is not acting that actually reacting to the real to me\nAt Cornell Cornell we focus on representing men and domestic relations cases attorneys CPA choke or Dell we recognize that our clients are going to perhaps the toughest time they will ever go through we understand that everything that's important to the Amazon the table\nTheir assets the rolling their children's lives that sentimental

profile Democrats Andy CNN\nPolice sources also told ABC News the package found them to CNN building appeared to be a metal pipe with wires floors above and below the mail room with Time Warner ...\nFormer New York police department cheaper detectives rubber boys who is now an ABC News contributor said the police were on high alert says they're covering all the locations they have the ability to do this these are plans that we the NYPD goes through and does drills for right now the big thing is rendering the devices safe\nSo I Would think you would think I mean as many of these are that are out there and they're not exploded that you'd be able to trace these things pretty easy minor thing is the one that the CNN building over their Time Warner was delivered by career so\nVideotape but this guy all over the place I'm sure you track this guy down say who gave you the bomb you know or maybe he was the one who uh built the bomb who knows\nBut if it is a Trump supporter what a flipping idiot\nWhat is the flipping idiot either way I mean no doubt this is just beyond the pale whoever's doing this kind of stuff see this is exactly what we're trying to avoid in this country is is the rancor and hatred elevated this level on both sides\nOn both sides\nAnd I wonder if Trump comes out and says we want to we want to tamp down the anger on both sides how dare you this is definitely one of your people\nThey heard your speech you know they're not what you were you were talking about being a nationalist\nThat's what it was you know somebody what was it was something that Trump said I Believe yesterday that somebody a blamed it well that's what they did that triggered him yes to\nThis you gotta have been doing this for weeks if not months planning this thing figuring out where these people are how they get the bombs to them and the rest of them and it's not like oh Trump said something yesterday morning at a rally I think I'll go make some bombs today and send them out\nI don't think it happens that way folks this is a concerted effort on somebody's part to do something it could be somebody trying to you but I don't know whether you know to me they didn't go off which is really odd or if they were trying to kill these folks they're a very lousy terrorist\nIt seems to me that either somebody well somebody's trying to influence the election and we just don't know which way but of course the mainstream media they're going to automatically assume that it's some right wing nuts and look when it sent to a bunch of ... out there that's a pretty good assumption I'm just telling you something thinks about this\nFrom the time I heard this morning I'm going okay All right this is a little too obvious isn't it\nA little too are going after George Soros\nSo that's because of you because you've been on the radio just hammering George Soros so your your responsibility and I'm sure it's me\nGood great what if we find that it is a list or other show well see I'm not even ... we had a guy [laughter] this has been several years ago some guy in Nashville rear end if you remember this Johnny rear ended somebody with a Hillary bumper sticker wasn't what it was\nAnd uh they said it was the time of my show they figured that he was listening to me and got mad and rear end of the Hillary Clinton supporter I'm going oh please that's a stretch isn't it and even if he did I haven't said anything to incite people to violence I've been just the opposite I've been trying to get the violence out of all this stuff [noise]\nAnd see anything else you need to know well there'll be more developments obviously I Hope they can\nFigure out who this is a pretty quickly Trump condemning the act president briefed on this suspicious packages\nSent to Hillary and Obama homes the White House has issued a statement\nForcefully condemning the attempted violent attacks we condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against President Obama President Clinton Secretary Clinton another public figures Sarah Sanders said in a statement these terrorizing acts are despicable and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law\nA vice president Mike Pence all can also condemned the despicable acts the president's son Don junior condemn the instance as well as drawing on his family's experience being the target of attempted attacks in the past which by the way got absolutely no play in the press\nThat it and they set a white powder that Donald Trump junior oh big deal okay what's next let's go back to the mother and\nHe said this is a D.
