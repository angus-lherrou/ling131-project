eighty they must have talked to someone without noise today\nHenderson bail Nashville\nStudio we're talking about I mean I [noise]\n... for a clock I came along with your story the state Supreme Court has reset the execution date forgets and made Edmunds a gory ski he's now set to die by the electric chair I Know them or first he was\nGranted that delay by the governor after appealing to the Tennessee Supreme Court and he wanted to die by electrocution instead of lethal injection state granted that request it spreads you buy staples\nBut the people on the left don't light capitalism\nBecause they think capitalism is unfair\nBut it's only ... if you don't want to participate in it then what we're seeing with a bunch of the empty for people is they are misfits in society and they got to get out there and make it happen they're all upset about capitalism because they think it's unfair but it's unfair because they don't want to do the work that's necessary to make it in a\nCapitalist society it's all about hard work and it's all about not just hard work with smart work\nSo this guy guard city is on CNN's State of the union over the weekend and he was asked about the fifty percent increase in homelessness in Los Angeles\nHe says and Jake Tapper was talking to him\nHe says you were screened for four hours this week at a town hall homeless on homelessness homelessness has nearly a fifty percent in your city since you became mayor of Los Angeles times\nNow the now there's a tie for this outbreak likely due to the booming number of rats attracted by all the food and human waste on Skid Row in other places some critics may be saying why are you campaigning for Democrats in the midterms in traveling\nWhen you have this huge crisis in your backyard and ... says well I think they are linked together and I welcome a national conversation in Washington DC\nWhere you see more homeless per capita than you see\nIn Seattle in San Francisco you see in red and blue cities well I don't know if there aren't any red cities are they're they're all blue says we have a mental health crisis that I Will agree is just what you do about it\nMayors can avoid that he says a lot of people told me never touched the issue of homelessness\nI Am so passionate about it people are dying on our streets from opioid addiction I'm so proud of our voters in Los Angeles who passed two largest matters to combat homelessness\nThis is what people say isn't an solvable problem and I'm committed to solving it we're opening up new beds are type his numbers are about the same as they had been in the past we are focused on preventing homelessness we've got veterans kids\nA lot of my wife and I are foster parents we have folks coming out of sexual violence\nTo understand homelessness we really do need leadership from Washington DC well who is the leader on the opioid crisis Donald J Trump for crying out loud he's made this a priority in his administration do something about opioids\nBut the deal with this is you know we've got over prescribing ... going on for many years and that's going to take a while to wash out and people have not been able to get the opioid prescriptions so they turn to heroin it's a huge problem there's no doubt about that and we have to do something about it\nBut his solution is to is to create more beds in other words a homeless high rise of people are not homeless because they're homeless I Know that sounds counter intuitive to do a lot of you folks out there people are not homeless because they don't have a home they're homeless because they can't keep a job\nIf you have a job you can get a home and I'm not talking about buying a home I'm Talking about being able to rent whether it's renting an apartment renting a room renting some weird that shelter for yourself but you can't do that if you're not working\nSo you first have to figure out why homeless people are not working some has to do with mental illness some has to do with addiction but there are some folks out there that just don't want to work\nAnd the worst thing you can do is just build high rise for the homeless and expect the problem to go away what you do is you create a magnet and that's why you've got a fifty percent increase in homelessness\nIn Los Angeles is because they're putting these people in these little micro houses and high rise homeless places and then they keep coming and so we don't have enough to fit everybody that's because words gotten out that all I gotta do to ... to get to LA and you'll take care of me\nWe have got to reach the people and help them solve their problems you know folks like\nThe national rescue mission and that's what they do but there's accountability that comes with it and it's it's a um it's a Christian centered thing and that's why the left hates it you can make them go to a church service ... there was a talk show host another station\nAnd she was a big lib and um we were talking about the Nashville rescue mission and she thought that it violated constitutional rights to make them sit through a church service in order to get a free place to stay at night she really thought that that violated their their constitutional rights so\nThey show up at the place they say look you can go through the line and get yourself some food and we'll give you a place to stay but we're asking you to sit through a a a sermon we're going to have some I talk to you about about Christ and oh my gosh that's a separation of church and homelessness or something I don't know what that is\nShe thought it violated constitutional rights they don't have to do it at all there's nothing that mandates of Nashville rescue mission and he has other Christ based\nUm uh ministries out there ... there's nothing that mandates have to do anything if you're going to come to their facility if you're going to take advantage of what they're giving you then you're going to have to give something in return and all they ask you just sit through a church\nService and these people wouldn't give people on the left grazing king so I've talked to some of these folks out there who were standing on the street corners\nHad one guy several years when my kids were smaller or small they're not small anymore when they were little kids in car we pull off I was coming to the radio station one day to pick something up on a Saturday I Believe and they were in the car with me and we pulled up to the traffic light there right off the off ramp and as a guy standing with the you know\nThe ... what a sign that will work for food and the you know I Know are these folks because these are the bombs\nSo this guy came up and they actually knocked on the window and I cracked window I don't run all the way down like crack the window I said well can I Do for you he said man I Am so hungry could you just give me some money just wanted to read something to eat\nAnd I said well you know the national rescue mission is about six blocks down this way ah and they're feeding says uh no I've already missed the window while I Know the national rescue mission I looked at my watch and I said no they're actually serving for forty five more minutes\nYou can just make it and you know what he said F. you\nGreat lesson for the kids I said this guy's a bomb if he wanted to eat there is a ... there's a rescue mission down the street and they will feed him but he doesn't want to go there because they ask something in return he wants me to give him five dollars so we can go buy some more who ...\nOr whatever it is hard to do what will cursed for your won't curse for food that's right what courage and this happens on I was sitting in Greenwich Village with my brother in law many years ago same type situation you know how they have the outdoor seating and all that and they have they have a little\nChain across it you know to this you can get across the chain obviously is a grouping train a chain or but it's to keep people from going straight into the restaurant for that where they go through the front door to get to see them and we were sitting out there it was a nice sunny afternoon in Greenwich Village\nAnd that we were having a we're getting ready to have lunch when they brought the bread and we were sitting there with our drinks and the bread and this guy came walking up I mean he looked like I mean he look bad I mean skinny as a rail had no shirt on and they came up and he says\nI think some money I haven't eaten in three\nWhen my brother in law who's the ... this guy in the world you know he reaches for his pocket I reached on and grab the basket of bread and handed it to him\nAnd he said if you and walked off well he didn't want to eat if you hadn't eaten in three days somebody offered you a basket full of bread and you're gonna say F. you after you dude that's what we're dealing with\nSo when you're dealing with the homeless you have to separate the needy from the greeting this guy obviously wanted some money so he could shoot up some more heroin and I'm not going to help him with his addiction\nThere are people that will help you do this but you've got to want to help yourself\nYou can't force people into rehab they got to hit rock bottom and decide I Can't do this anymore I Can't I Can't handle this and that's the way that's taking care of but guard city in LA thinks it's Washington's problems see if we just through more money at it\nAnd you throw more money at it and what do you get you make yourself a magnet for the homeless you get more homeless folks you get more folks who are looking for a handout instead of for a hand up so that they had the creepy pouring lawyer out there is in a\nIt's just it's it's raining bad news on this guy

we will have paid for well I'm just saying anything that keeps them from coming here if we can help facilitate it and help the Mexicans throw these folks back into Guatemala\n[noise] we have got to make these countries responsible in Trump's doing the right thing he's saying where did you start cutting off your foreign aid if you're in Honduras in your ... law allowing these people leave your country and to Guatemala and your Guatemalan you allow him to leave in Mexico and if you're in Mexico you're allowed him to come to the border we're cutting off all your foreign aid screw ya\nAnd if you want the foreign aid back when they start fixing this problem before it comes to us ah Jerry in Alabama Europe next Jerry what's up\nTrying to sell all just a story about the military on the border back in my case and I was stationed in Okinawa with third Marine Division pulling out of Vietnam I was young lieutenant on my way to Vietnam but\nRiding to all encouraged control of the aisle and going back to Japan rather than being a territory they would do these long snake line dancers in front of the gay straw with military bases\nOn the island which were protected by Marines from third Marine Division\nAs\nThey would snake around in their dance periodically you'd have a big group of break off and head for the gates\nMarines were stationed at the gates and as soon as I step over the line of the ... they were met with harbor swallow bug strokes from the oil and fourteen rifles and Marines were armed with\nSometimes to the chair and body sometimes to their head but it was a very effective alternative to keep them off the base\nThat's that's something we we lined the military and uh right across the border for these people aren't so you ain't coming across period right\nYou know politically correct I don't know how well it would be now they hit a wall man the chest with a bunch of them for Kaine rifle but it sure as hell stop them from getting on the base and we can do the same thing today\nYeah I Know we had one guy who's to act I borderline\nAgree with the wind you know the one guy said when he started shooting and we can't you know\nYou can do start start picking off folks are with rifles who are on on but you can stand there and say we got a human chain link fence so you're you're not coming through us and if you come up to me and try to knock me down you're attacking me and I will fight back with the butter my gun\nBut you know this could all be avoided if we had the cooperation of the Mexicans the Guatemalans Hondurans and saying don't let these people get this far I haven't even seen where they are now I don't know how far out they are\nBut you know the the goal is to be here before election day and if you don't think that's a political you've lost your mind the mainstream media and then President Trump saying today you know there are some folks from terrorists countries that are in in in the ... and we know this happens all the time\nAnd so one of the reporters says ah ah how do you know he said go down there and investigate you'll see we're talking about well there have been some ... investigative reporters\nThey tend to be for more conservative outlets and they have talked to folks who were there from terrorists were were were there are hotbeds of terrorism in different countries and the mainstream media will pick it up\nBecause they don't want that narrative they don't want that story up there but that's part of the problem to the problem is we don't know who these people are we can't just let them into the country said Pensacola Europe next said what's up\nOh fill it real quick here on the head as far as revoking their foreign aid and everything else that they get a step further and I think that it really hit on a I mean obviously everybody said the best way to go to them in their pocketbook\n... up there in the state department the on the earth a no go zone for ... and all that all Americans evacuated out on the back like fake that includes all foreign aid workers everything up\nOr down all the other writer that's\nProbably why I'm probably like ... was hurt or something like that but I\nThink all of that on there and all of our a Walker and everything and all of a sudden hunger isn't going to take him on real\nThat's that is a great I mean can you imagine I mean not only that but you know the the uh the the dollars they make from the Americans that come you know I went down there with the church group church groups given all the time and I'm not seeing the church group should not go down there but if you want to him in the pocket book that's the way to do it ah\nThat would be very is you're no longer allowed to travel to Honduras to further known a hey I think we stop this

kneel during the playing of the star Spangled Banner Jenkins also sees his own former protesting to make teammates raised the fist in the air during the national anthem\nA while both Reid and Jenkins agree that there was reason to protest they did not agree on the next step\nJenkins agreed to stop raising his fist in the year after the NFL agreed to commit close to a hundred million dollars toward advancing social justice issues so sure makes me ... social justice issues\nLast year the agreement was struck between the legal news in a group known as the players coalition which was founded by Jenkins and retired NFL start a and one mold and\nWell there were players who are not on board to read and Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas said they were withdrawing from the agreement they were limited but\nBecause they claimed that bold and Jenkins purposely excluded Kaepernick from their discussions with the owners say they want this guy back in the league\nA and they are all these people saying well you know we need to protest until they hire capital somewhere Kaepernick is not that good that's the point if he were good it wouldn't matter what the news doing they would have him on the field some were playing but he's just not that good\nSo he moves on I can guarantee you if some of these teams are losing you doing John rude and wouldn't put them on and trying to say did they lose again yesterday I wasn't paying attention or are they even play\nYesterday uh yeah some of these teams that they need a quarterback well they apparently don't think that a camper Nick is up to snuff they also think he might be a huge distraction because his whole thing is is stupid protests thing instead of actually winning football games\nAnd if you're at it actually winning football games he'd still be the starting quarterback for the forty niners but he's not\nNow the caravan ladies and gentlemen the\nCare bans on the way and the question now is what is going to be done about it well\nThat remains to be seen we don't know exactly what the president has a mind for this but he says he's not going to lose than my understanding is well just from reading his tweets and things like this is that\nHe is allowing a the diplomatic\nThe diplomatic avenue to play out he's a he's working and threatening Honduras Guatemala and even Mexico a with cutting off funding and if they don't do something about this so we'll see if that plays out let me\nLet me go to a hold on I mean it's always instructive and fun to go to the president's tweets so let me go to today's tweets his stomach to some folks he's campaigning for then he does this this this is from this morning\nSad but it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states criminals and unknown middle Easterners or mixed in I've alerted border patrol and military that this is a national emergency misspelled emergency though must change laws\nAnd then he tweeted this right after it every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nSync up and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remember the midterms so unfair to those who come in legally and then he created this\nWater Marla Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country incoming illegally to the U.S we will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\nAnd that was as three tweets about the care of and this morning he's been on to a ...\nBetween this and this is a story we had several weeks ago shock report us paying more for illegal immigrants birth than Trump's wall and that was from several weeks ago and it's true\nAnd this is just in a year\nWhat we're paying for illegal alien birth can you imagine\nThe subsequent money we're having to pay to keep these people 'cause a lot of these you know these folks there supposedly citizens\nAnd so then they get benefits because their parents can't take care of him and so we give the Medicaid and all sorts of things and then they may actually grow up to be on welfare so there's no telling what the final ticket is on some of these folks who come here and our birth in the United states by legal parents\nBut it would be a lot cheaper just to build the wall and keep them out to start with and it's looking more and more and more like see this is what I'm doing is going to happen\nThese folks on the left they were ... during this family separation thing if you look at actually the polling and the the sentiment out there with the folks\nI think seeing all these people are massing of the border scared scared people they're going my gosh look all these folks because usually the invasion is a trickle we don't see them they come\nIn you know ten twelve fifty at a time we don't see 'em all coming in together when you see 'em a mass of humanity a mass that the um the at the border then uh\nI think it it it backfires on the Democrats and the liberals out there because they start looking at this going well we sure don't need that we don't even know who these people are it really accentuate the point of why we have legal immigration you're going well who are these people we have no idea who these people are\nBecoming here illegally now I'll tell you this the ones who come through the border checkpoint\nThere there'll be processed and the legal way the ones who come across the border because this is what happened they said well it was too long of a weight so we went down you know a few miles and then we've just cross the border and the rest of those folks and they were the ones who were thrown in detention centers the ones coming across legally were not thrown in detention centers and they didn't\nHave the kids that from him it was the ones who came illegally so when the American\nPeople see these folks show up right before the election I think they said actually backfire on them if it creates a humanitarian crisis of the border and people are going we're going to have a wall my gosh and trucks going\nThat I tell you now look what's happening if we had a wall here we wouldn't have to worry about these people just running across the border they would all go through the processing ports

all this money that is now flowing back\nTo you that is flowing into the economy that's creating jobs it's creating all sorts of wonderful things in the economy\nThey want to cut that off and just

the poor and the working class\nThis is what we're up against this according to CNBC their proposals would get rid of the tax cuts and in turn funnel that money into government guaranteed cash for low and middle income families\nCapital Harris of Democrat announced a plan this week that will get working families of the six thousand dollars each year but Cory Booker wants to go more than that he wants to give for folks up to fifty thousand dollars in cash\nHis ideas get lower income kids a sizable nest egg that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house for college tuition\nThese opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grow up and wealthier homes\nWhy you know if somebody said well you're wealthy fill my kids don't have a cash nest egg they're out there working at least\nI'm trying to get him to know I got one working in one looking for a job and they're scraping by one kid he comes over has dinner with us and then my wife gives them stuff out of the pantry it's like a you know like one of those food banks or something\nHe's eating a hamburger helper during the week he's trying to make ends meet a new nest egg I'm not giving these folks and nest egg it where you can only afford to do that 'cause you rich [laughter] yeah I can only afford to give them bread out of the pantry because I'm filthy rich yeah it's unbelievable\nSci I you know I Know some rich folks and and a lot of them I Know we're doing the same thing's going to make it on your own go out there is one I did\nOh your daddy was rich let me tell you a story about momentum is elected and as he used to like to say um you know I Know I've said this before but when I hear myself do it again so\nWe're sitting around that this is when we were young and I don't know how my sister was she was probably I don't know ten or eleven and a my father you know he always sat there in the morning at the breakfast table drinking a cup of coffee and reading the newspaper\nAnd we would come down and we had our places at the table and we would sit down and we would get something to eat a bowl of cereal or whatever would sit around and he would chat with us you know in between looking at stories and they'd comment on the news and did you see this in the news a day in this kind of stuff\n[noise] and my uh my sister who's five years younger than me she's sitting there one morning and she says ... one of my friends says we're rich\nAnd they looked over the paper and look down over his reading glasses says no honey I'm rich you're poor and went back to reading his [laughter]\nSo [laughter] oh\nBut I mean that's the way it was you know I ... I left home went\nTo university ah Near East Carolina University for a semester and a half in this I don't want to get into broadcasting and went to a broadcast school and he says look out split it with you\nBut you got to go to work so I wanted to work waiting tables and paying my part of it and paying for my apartment and all this stuff and I was cut off at that point I mean he paid for half the education which was a thousand dollars to go to the broadcast school and he paid five hundred I paid the rest of it\nAnd then I got into radio and there was no turning back you know I've told you the story about the coats and I was telling us again to my stepmother 'cause every time I tell this about star crime because it's one of those stories that you know it's one of those life lessons that that parents teach and you don't quite understand it when they do\nBut I had already been out working for several years matter of fact I started I started in radio I I've been seen by this time I had been in radio about six years\nAnd I was working in Greensboro is a program director um and I got washed out in the format change you folks in radio know how that works\nGeneral manager came and says we're switching to a new format you you you you're all grown they're bringing new people for the new form and we were doing an oldies for them and they were going to like some you know beautiful music or something like that anyway\nLong story short is I didn't have a whole lot of money saved\nUp probably didn't have heart hardly any at all and so I figured I got to get another job so I went to work for an ad agency selling jingles suddenly Herman tell the story before and in order to sell the jingles you know I was on straight commission so there was no money up front\nI had to go out and make sales calls\nAnd so I went to had to go buy some sport coats cause I had to have something to weigh I couldn't just show up in you know genes or whatever and I had some khaki pants and a dress shirt and so I was just going to switch out the tie and the sport coat every day and go make sales goals\nSo I needed five hundred dollars for five ... a sport coats\nSo I went to my father is law office and I said uh\nI'd appreciate your help on this I said I'm trying to get off the ground and the sales thing of course he's the one who told my brother that how clean this up he said that Phil couldn't sell sex on the troop train but uh [laughter]\n\nSo he knew it was an ill fated endeavor but I went to when I said I I Would really appreciate it if you could help me out and give me five hundred bucks I'll pay you back you know when I get up and running but I just need five hundred bucks to buy the sport coats and then as soon as I'm making money\nAnd get my commissions and stuff I'll pay you back\nHe said son I'll go down to the bank right around the corner and co signed for you if you want me to and I said are you serious\nYou're not going to you're not going to help me out he said I'm helping me out I'm gonna go down and co signed for you get five hundred bucks you can pay them back\nSo I stormed out of his law is man went around the corner guy working there was a loan officer was um he was several years older than me but I knew him and I went and I said look and I told him the stories and we don't worry about that will give you five hundred bucks you don't have to have and the coast on\nAnd so I've gotten a check for five hundred bucks and I walked back down to my father's office stormed into his office he had the office all the way the back and I held up the check and I said see I don't need you\nAnd that's exactly what he wanted\nWanted me to be independent where I don't mean him\nWell that was called tough love it took me years to figure out he wasn't a big SOB he was actually just trying to make me independent and at work\nI work three months in that job made a hundred dollars and commission and figured that this was not the line of work for me and so I packed up everything I had moved to Nashville, Tennessee without a job and the rest is history and I ended up paying the bank back the\nA hundred bucks we have to make people and I'm you know I'm trying to use the same lessons with my kids but it's tough as a father you know the main things you know but\nThey need to get out there and make it on their own and you know why you do this you do this because you love your kids run well then why don't we do this for everybody else if we really love our fellow man why are we going to give 'em fifty thousand dollars so that when they become adults they got fifty thousand dollars in the bank\nThere's no telling what they're going to spend the fifty thousand on they say well they could do it for a down payment for a house or college tuition wonder if they

opportunity to counter the liberals and the Democrats in Congress want to want to start this is Vioxx of course boxes left wing I mean how many places that aren't being the mainstream media\n[noise] they say America's wealth gap that is what they are obsessed with the wealth you how many have you folks give a rat's Ron How much Trump or bill\nEight or anybody else's man yeah I Know what am I what am I here the bill gates is making a trillion times more than I'm making it doesn't take anything away from me\nBut they want you to believe that there's a finite amount of wealth and if somebody gets rich there obviously taking it from you and that's not the case\nLook at how Bill Gates got rich for ... for a second Microsoft running so what is Microsoft done has it made a bunch of other people poor so that he could get rich no it made a bunch of other folks rich as he got rich and and also in rich us with\nComputer technology and what have you on my apologies you Mac folks which I Am one of

[laughter] but I'm Talking about\nDid it did it or diminish your income know what it did as it may live so much better you folks with iPhones out there would you rather that these folks didn't create all this stuff\nSo that we could buy it and make our lives better well that's what I'm Talking about\nThe left is obsessed with the wealth gap and the wealth gap matters not the only thing that matters is whether you're getting better or you are getting worse and when we look around America right now most people are getting better America's wealth gap they say grew rapidly\nSort of the late twentieth century in Nineteen sixty three families at the top of America's wealth distribution is another thing\nWe don't the wealth is not distributed it's burned there's no wealth distribution\nThere's only redistribution if the liberals get in power and they want to take the money away from the wealthy and give it to folks who haven't earned it\nBut families at the top of America's wealth distribution had six times the wealth of those in the middle six times by twenty swelled the wealthiest had twelve times the assets of middle income families now I Want to ask you this do you think the middle income is better off now than they were in Nineteen sixty three\nWithout a doubt the middle class has more cool stuff the cars are nicer\nOr the food is better the TVs are bigger there's nothing in the middle class that is not better than it was in Nineteen sixty three but they're obsessed with the wealth gap has grown\nWell the wealth gap is grown but the middle class has gotten better off his ... matter of fact there are more people moving out of the middle class and into the wealthy and if that's the case how was that bad well they they keep talking about the shrinking middle class the shrinking middle class\nThe middle class is shrinking if it is because people in the middle class are getting richer now because people in the middle class getting poorer if you look at the poverty rate\nIt hovers twelve to fourteen percent any given year it doesn't matter what the only thing that matters whether we're in a recession or not when there's a recession was about fourteen percent poverty rate when we're not in a recession is about twelve percent\nThat doesn't change so how in the world is the shrinking middle class a problem obviously the middle class is shrinking because they're moving into the upper middle class or the wealthy they're not getting poor or those numbers would be willing to twenty five thirty percent\nHere's what else they say specific government policies have driven the racial gap now we got a racial gap\nBy making it specifically harder for minorities to accrue wealth the decades long practice of the federal housing authority refused to underwrite housing loans to many black families for example made it difficult for those families to pass on the earnings of real estate that their children the way of white family might",
