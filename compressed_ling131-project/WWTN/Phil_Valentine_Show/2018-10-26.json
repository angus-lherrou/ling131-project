at telling your supporters to rise up and kill a bunch of black people\nI mean that's a bit of a jump but I think you know what I mean you got all these people that are screaming about President Trump incessantly\nAnd and this whole notion of of a dog whistle and how the president is sort of you know wink wink nod nod and that if you're a supporter of his that you should go do a porn things to the

think that the a perfectly valid question to ask\nThe president earlier this week talked about or you know how he's the national is and he and he said by being a nationalist by calling myself a nationalist then essentially what I'm doing is I'm saying that I'm a super patriot and he did say\nThere is a big difference between a nationalist and a white nationalist\nAnd I read you the whole

hour leading\nTo the rest of this morning of the suspect in sending Thirteen improvised explosive devices correspondent she won't ...\nThe guy's name is ah things are so yuck fifty six years old from Florida\nThey say he's the guy at least they think he's the guy and you know how they got him fingerprint on Maxine Waters bomb\nSend her they found a fingerprint and that's\nThe main way they got him he lives in Florida used to live in New York and apparently is quite crazy\nHe's um got a van this got Trump bumper stickers and Trump stuff all over the windows and everything else\nI Know with some of you were thinking I'd fault the same thing this sounds a little bit too convenient I mean they've kind of gone overboard on this guy being the Trump guy be one thing if he had a Trump ... bumper sticker and maybe closest some stuff about Trump\nI Want to see his social media dating back years\nNot just in the last few months\nAnd I don't know that we can see that I Would assume Twitter Facebook wherever he's been they've they've deleted or frozen accounts or you can see me my I don't know I haven't gone looking for the day or will it matter of fact though\nI got a couple of stories on that but that I'll share with you about what he was saying and the and the social media but apparently the guy is a first class not case looks to be I mean anybody who's sending these devices by the FBI says these were not hoax devices\nAnd um\nIf they didn't go off so if he's a bomb maker he's not a very good when\nSo we'll be exploring all of that still don't have the you know they send them again okay well as soon as we get this I'll explain what it is when we know\nAh but you can do a search for this guy now my understanding is that the the social media that they're pointing to is not from saves are say it's from the ... or somebody else that I've looked at the pictures I'm going well the mug shot picture makes them look like a woman to me\nI'm woman with very short have you seen the mug shot you think it was like a woman yeah 'cause I thought at first 'cause they flash it up there when they did the story first thing this morning and I said why oh gosh there's a woman and then they started talking about hey I'm going hey\nHey let's say hey it's a man man so yeah it's it looks like a shame\nBut he's a ... was in New York now lives in Florida and they've arrested the guy in the ... the social media that I'm looking at is not using the same last name which is a little bit odd don't you think I mean it looks like he would have the same last name less he's trying to fly\nUnder the radar FBI Director Chris Wray on a rest and the suspicious packages case we have arrested ... say ah in connection with this investigation and he says these bombs or these mailings were not hoaxes\nSo I don't know whether they felt that they could go off and they didn't but I don't I'm looking at some of the people tweeting about this even more room has you know how can this for a little while ago I don't know it it's hard to tell\nAnd youth liberals that they will see he tells he was a Trump got does that we figured he was probably a Trump guy I told you yesterday it's either a a good old boy Trump guy or somebody posing as a good old boy drunk guy\nBut either way it doesn't make any difference\nNobody was hashed tagging Bernie shooter when that guy shot Steve's beliefs because nobody really believes that Bernie Sanders was the cause of this guy shooting Steve skill leaf and you can believe in your right mind that Trump\nIs behind this guy sending the bombs well but he was inflamed by his rhetoric in ... what is Trump said that would that would lead someone to send bombs everybody\nWell he's he's always talking about the fake news and yeah well it is fake news but that doesn't mean that you send a bomb to the fake news folks\nWas always on majority shores are yeah we talked about George ... here's the deal and this is exactly what the left does they want to use this to silence you\nAnd me and Trump they want us to stop talking about them because it's inflaming faults well I'm just sorry about that\nHow many left is that we've seen to go and shoot up a school or whatever we don't tell the left is to stop whatever it is they're talking about\nThis is a matter of free speech while she just got some nut case comes forward with some with some mail bombs are against some of the folks that Trump has been talking about does it mean that Trump is even remotely responsible for the guy it doesn't mean that at all\nVice news saying a Twitter account register with say a first name and middle names\nFrequently tweeted photographs himself at Trump rallies along with hundreds of racist means and conspiracy theories about Brock Obama Maxine Waters and Elizabeth Warren so apparently that that other name were seeing was his middle name so we don't know who knows\nSaid he's a registered Republican was born in New York ... that's the thing the blooming blew my mind there's a Republican to New York has a long criminal history dating back to Nineteen Ninety One charges ranging from suddenly ... drug offenses to fraud he was also a male stripper which is just kind of a two\nThirty say they're able to identify him by a fingerprinted left on one of the bombs mailed a Maxine Waters\nCourt documents trace the life of a marked by instability in crime\nFirst arrested in Nineteen Ninety One and a felony charge in Broward County Florida followed by Nineteen Ninety four rest on charges of domestic violence in two thousand two he was arrested on charges of making bomb threats and they got probation for that so let me get this straight\nThe guy is charged he's a felon theft charge then domestic violence and then he gets arrested a few years later of making bomb threats and they just put them on probation\nTwo years later he was interested on a number of felonies including tampering with physical evidence possession of an unlawfully issue driver's license and possession with intent\nTo sell at least three different types of of steroids anabolic steroids and twenty Thirteen he was arrested again on theft in battery charges he was

take a drug to complete one eighty on that oh my gosh if we were going to cap on some guy promoting that's an interesting observation I'm Glad you made that brand because if he is a convicted felon

G. I. bill wouldn't you like to see cleaner air for our country I mean that has nothing to do with climate change that's it you know the less fossil fuels workout cleaner air for our kids cleaner for\nFor hunting or will it be great but that the market should decide this I mean we've cleaned the Arab dramatically in the last few years\nAnd by the way the the main source of a of a of this I'm a pollution real pollution I don't think is the automobiles its factories and things like this and I think we ought to be cleaning that up too so I'm a big clean air fan\nBut the reality of factor the burden is cars will write but where do you think you're going to get the electricity\n\nThat my second point here let's go into the first one where are you going to get the electricity from coal fired plants I what I refer to these electric cars is coal fired cars so until we come up with a replacement for coal you're still going to have the same problem probably even worse\nOh there we don't own a more of a dead horse I think it's a good thing that\nWe will be a great thing to change but we don't have enough solar to replace coal that's why we haven't moved from it\nLet me let me a second point right so obviously solar all ... all the technology thing so much economic\nUh a bunch of waiting for people to take it people will make money the only way history and you take a businessman like Trump about about the economy would want to take this opportunity and stuff as a dead horse\nBut it's not that's the whole problem that the money to be made there is not there yet if it were people would be doing it\n\nA real American way to go go or they want to like new new industry we want to take advantage of it\nWell yeah but that comes from the private sector not the government that's my whole point let the private sector move towards solar if there's going to be money in it but right now there's not\nSo on it though\nOh yeah absolutely it it's going to change on its own eventually anyway I mean the more the technology comes down the pike that make solar more viable we're going to move towards solar but the problem is solar doesn't work at the ...\nI mean I I'd rather do it I feel like I Would\nNot or\nSomeone that this was on\nThe phone bill if their electric cars that they are now and you're driving a V. eight Silverado what's wrong with you\n\nKnow it's not about liberal you're big on this and I don't blame you you're big on cleaning the air and everything why um and you got an electric vehicle they're all over the place\nIt really is I like it when you look

but if you believe that your internal combustion engine is making the ear dirty then stop driving one but Beth wants it mandated to him before he does it that makes no sense whatsoever\nIf there are people out there who truly believe he sounds passionate about it\nIf they're truly believing that if he would stop driving his um\nV. eight Silverado the world will be a better place than bill would

certainly they're going to fingerprint the guy's got a record or a mile long\nAnd so they found the guy they followed them around to see if he was going to do any more of this apparently and the the ... nobody wanted to give them that Trump band I don't think\nThat's just bizarre the whole thing it to me and I again I don't want to go down conspiracy row here but it's so over the top you know it's like I'm a Trump guy looking at a van with Trump stuff all over and I hate CNN and up sending stuff to all the folks that Trump doesn't like in the George Soros and it\nIt just seems to it's to neatly package to me that's all I'm going to say we'll see what comes out of it\nThe Twitter stuff that they've got from a ramming about CNN and everything else has only from October I Want to see what he's been doing over the last couple of years they say he registered to vote as a Republican within the last year\nIn Florida I guess he was from New York moved to Florida he's a or was a stripper this guy who would want to\nSee that dude strip\nMy gosh I mean is there is there the um anti stripper where you put it on you know you come out there in about it and make it and then they watch you put your clothes on I mean somebody may may be the prince and\nPut it on their yelling put it all and put it all and put it on\nThis is the worst white privilege I have ever seen says a black NBC Stafford deeply hurt the Megan Kelly is playing the hash tag me to card to collect their sixty nine million dollars in payout\nNumber of Megan Kelly is black colleagues at NBC are shocked that she's fighting to receive a full pay out of her contract that for her comments depending blackface earlier this week\nThat she's not again she wasn't defending blackface she was talking about it was okay to go as a black character\nIf you're a diner people thinking that oh Miami come on folks that's not what she was saying her problem is she apologized for it and she should never have done that and that left the door open to Boulder\nDaily mail spoke to a number of employees who's feelings on this subject ran the gamut from deeply hurt to outrage appalled at Kelly's behavior in the report says she might play in her coverage of the me too movement played a role in their termination\nAnd you know all this started on Tuesday she apologized on Wednesday she was out on Thursday and insider the network told the daily mail\nThat after meeting with Kelly and her staff on Wednesday a number of employees of color on the show voice their frustration and anger with the host to human resources\nLots of people were willing to give her it are they doing that to me right now they're going into human resources are still says okay to dressed as a black person if your wife of course it's okay if it's a character for credit if it's Diana Ross if it's\nIf you're Billy Crystal and its Sammy Davis junior by the way we have a companion story on this and you'll find all this is Phil Valentine that common to show prep\nOut ranging from the left and then they got pictures of Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimble and Sarah Silverman all in black face\nAll of them yes\nJimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimble and Sarah Silverman actually dressed in blackface themselves at some point during their career Kimball\nWhile the host of Comedy Central's the man show dressed up more than once in blackface make up a ball cap and a body suit to portray former Utah Jazz basketball player Carl Malone as an inarticulate demoted person who had difficulty pronouncing words correctly matter of fact\nLuther its own show

Luther if it Phil Valentine dot com on your show prep he's asked me where his show ... there's an arrow there's an arrow\nYeah you go down it's about halfway down a little more than halfway down outrage on the leftover Megan Kelly is blackface comments click on that story they Luther and there's a there's a video of Jimmy Kimble in black fur I Hope he's not saying something we can't ... because I haven't heard this yet\nFallon was hosting the Golden Globes and twenty Seventeen his Chris Rock impression reminded the producers of the one he did while it's Saturday Night live in two thousand in blackface\nAnd two thousand seven\nSarah Silverman donned the most racist black face in a comedy sketch on the Sarah Silverman show a move she later said she regrets\nKelly when they've just started getting tell me what a Megan Kelly says All right so this is a this\nIs Jimmy Kimble this is when he was doing the man show on Comedy Central and again he's dressed up like a black guy all black skin got I'm near bald head he's impersonating Carl Malone [noise]\nSometime and night horrible oh look at the sky and say what the hell's going on out there for them on other planets phone and a whole lot in common low rate on TV about white people getting out to buy alley singing all on a hell of a lot of Santa Fe\nNow home alone ever seen a flying saucer himself but if you do that for me ... all say that I've been very cost is real bad or something I don't know what he's\nGoing to say so that so he's making fun of Carl Malone being in our ticket with right now when I Do just the jets and I'm just a a a new justice Jackson with the ...\nIt's an abomination for nature and you know but I don't I don't make it sound like he's a flipping idiot\nAnd by the way I've never dressed up as Jesse Jackson and probably won't now but um I don't know it has crossed my mind\nSo I Do characters on the show and I do Jesse Jackson a Johnny does Phil Bredesen\nJohnny also does it mean Bill Clinton I Do Bill Clinton but he doesn't mean George W I'd do Georgia we do 'em all we do stereotypical rednecks we do we do stereotypical ah Boston accents in New York accents and then of course the coup de grace the folks\nWho Johnny\nI'm just going to talk to you about these guys because there may be some Italian Americans who are a little bit of a wig we'll envy though you know and it\nCould be that it could be in that he could be angry\nNow we've been doing this a long time and maybe one complaint from some of the guy on there when I told her hey look\nYou complain a little bit louder but we're going to and we do it over there to see\nWhat I'm saying you know when you might be ... in a big town ... that's right you may be riding in the back with some seaman shoes so don't mess with us you know the trunk is picking them for you in a friend\nSo is that offensive when I was a snowflake comes on the show this is if somebody pregnant said snowflakes than a millennial he's or whatever they are the millennials are older\nOr whatever so snowflake is whatever he is he's a college student in a safe space he's a stereotypical me I'm going to have my therapy dog and all the rest of it and you might get\nSee what we're getting to in this country is where we ... you're going to be afraid to do anything and that's exactly what they want you to do they want to control your thoughts it's not\nGoes beyond speech it goes the thought control which brings me that in this next story here this is ... and this is coming here to folks coming to an American court near you Europe's top human rights court has ruled\nThat comments about Mohammed having had a feeling tendencies are not covered by the right to freedom of expression agreeing with the assessment of courts in Austria the remarks constitute quote an abusive attack on the profit of Islam\nWhich could stir up prejudice and threatened religious piece a seven judge European Court of human rights\nA instructs board\nConcluded that the Austrian courts had quote carefully balance the applicants right to freedom of expression where the rights of others that have their religious feelings protected and have religious piece preserved in the Austrian society it came after\nNine years after Elizabeth uh ... wolf or actually vote with\nAn Austrian political science scientists and activists held a seminar in Vienna where among other things she criticized the treatment of women in Islam the topic of Mohammed marriage to Asia the youngest of his doesn't why it was and concubine came up according to Islamic texts\nThe seventh century ... was founded who founded Islam or was ... to ... when she was\nSix six\nThe marriage was consummate and when she was nine but he's not a pedophile and if you say that you're offending people that are Muslim and you must be stopped the court records yes\nNow in the case of Megan Kelly and as I've said about anything you know it it it boils down to you know it it's NBC's gig there you know their network they can pretty much do what they want to\nBut I think that it's chilling for people who are supposed to be engaging in a talk show bits about free speech that when you exercise of free speech and you don't see exactly what they want you to do the fire you so either you're gonna have a a show on the air this about free speech or not\nBut you need to put you need to put that in the ground rules\nYou can say whatever we want you to say is what it should be in the contract you need to run everything by as you can\nYou can see what you want you can say what you what we want you to say and then you don't have a talk show anymore you don't have a TV talk show you're on a radio talk show you don't have free speech anymore that point when you got some gatekeepers sitting in wherever New York\nAnd the ... ... ... didn't like it's like the old sensors except at least the censors were trying to keep the F word of the year but I mean back then you're going to have Ricky Lucy and the same bed and times have changed and the left of course it's been so\nAdamant about well you know we we don't mean to be censoring than you know you need to be able to eat whatever you want to and they don't have any problem with saying the F. word or anything else on network television but\nBy gosh you voice an opinion they don't like and then you're going to have you imagine I guarantee you that would have no problem with with Megan Kelly saying the F. word but when you say the blackface word which by the way she wasn't defending blackface well what do you call it\nI call it somebody address ... black faces ... the entire year all black you know [laughter]\nI mean it's not like somebody putting on black base in big wide around the lip single when Mamet come on folks but again when you ask me\nTo ask people to be offended by it why should I care good grief you want me to run everything by everybody out there might offend good I'm sure we're going to hear from the Muslims on the pedophile thing\nBut that doesn't change the fact that it's true and it doesn't change the notion that I have of free speech\nSo if I think that Mohammed was a pedophile I can say Mohammed was a pedophile and I should not have to worry about it especially when there's documented evidence in the ... about it he married they want a girl when she was six and they concentrated the marriage when she was nine what are you called live\nSo I'm I'm not doing this to poke at the mayor or anything I'm just telling you\nThis woman got fined in Austria\nFor having a class at a University in Vienna where they talked about Islam and talked about some of the the not so nice things about Islam and then she gets fined for it and I'm sure she lost her good to like Megan Kelly Dana you're up next the film at one time Joe how are you\nStill doing great\nSo I just wanted to call I uh I Know you're talking about mark I or and YouTube or\nHe did a video yesterday about the like Kelly Ayotte to folks like Jimmy Kimmel overlapping you know the way of brothers doing the white chicks that the one that was close to the end and the video I thought you'd get a kick out a had your boy Howard Stern dressed up looking like Clarence Thomas\nOh really yeah you might wanna watch video yesterday [laughter] uh I'm sure who's going to have to lose his gig on Syria sex him hey exactly exactly precisely the tip of my regular look for the\nWhat did they ask you this what I mean what if this comes up Howard Stern dressed as as Clarence Thomas it it's a character you know what I mean it's it's a it's a real person like Diane Ross is there any difference a what\nA big fire him now from series acts him he's the thing that's making them the most money over there and one of the were the fire Howard Stern because they're going to go back twenty some years and find out that he dressed up like Clarence Thomas\nSee what I'm getting at what are we going to photograph of me and Miami oh my gosh I'm just telling you folks political correctness\nIs ruining this country and I look the November ... elections aren't all about that but they're somewhat about that

mean they they uh they get to stay we're going to make sure they don't come across in the ... people have said that you might shoot him no we're not going to shoot them we're not shooting anybody and so CNN sibling\nNo intention of shootings you can just putting them in their mind like a ... but we might you know you know we don't have any intention of it right now but you don't know\nThey're not going to shoot the camera banners for crying out loud but of course that's from CNN\nWashington Post story Mexican shower the caravan with kindness\nAnd so that's what you're getting now they're they're trying to build this thing up and it just it ain't happening it looks like\nThat's the key unless it's ... it looks like um well let's see this woman well see I don't get the Washington Post won't be read the headline is Trump considering plan to ban injury of migrants southern border planning do I think that's been the plan all along\nHe was from USA Today Trump threatened to seal the southern border over Margaret care where they can he\nWell this I can tell you can and\nI don't think he's feeling the border what he's doing is making sure the illegals don't come across illegal immigration will continue is not going to just say okay this is all over\nIt's unclear whether Trump is seriously considering a complete closure of the two thousand mile border with Mexico or if he's using the threats simply the get America's southern neighbors to cooperate\nHe vowed to use the U.S military to close the southern border he's talking about illegal is not the legal folks there's all sorts of Congress coming back and forth across have so many you think he's going to use the troops and go closed down every port of entry\nI don't think that's going to happen I don't think that's going to happen\nAnd here's what he tweeted and this was on the Eighteenth of October\nIn addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over their population I must and the strongest terms ass Mexico to stop this onslaught and as unable to do so I Will call upon a call up the U.S military to close our southern border what\nIt means is to the to the illegals we're not going to them just run across the desert we didn't yeah give it a job not going to happen so that's what that's all about but you don't hear much about the care of and because I'm hearing\nIs starting all fall apart and of course we got the bomber today and they may have this crazy guy and now there's a question as to who this\nGuy actually is it's and again I don't want to feed into what you say you don't feed into but you do\nI'm just saying this guy is like ... it's like somebody out of central casting I mean he's got a band it's plastered with pro Trump stuff and CNN sucks and all this other stuff all over it and then\nThere's pictures of him at a at you know with his ... hat and he's going to a rally in it you know it's everything from the boss Trump wine you know I mean it's just it got everything said it Trump resorts he played golf at ah at mar a Lago I mean it's you know it's it's really over the top and what we're hearing\nIs this guy may not be all that we're hearing he is and I warned you about that yesterday if this ends up being some Trump supporter we need to be able to get his social media from several years back not just from the last couple of months and everything I've seen today is taking screen shots\nBecause they've cut they've closes accounts down on Twitter and Facebook show it from just October how convenient\nWhat was he tweeting a year ago what was your twenty two years ago\nWhat was he saying to folks we don't have a clear picture of who this guy is and again if it turns out this is a nut case\nFanatic of Trump it doesn't mean that Trump's done anything wrong\nNo more than it meant the Bernie Sanders' campaign worker was representing Bernie Sanders when he shot Steve's beliefs and nobody in the mainstream media ever tried to make that connection but every time you turn around that's all they're doing is making the connection with Trump and this guy and a pie or earlier today saying\nA Trump admits this guy was a Trump supporter but won't take responsibility of course he's not going to take responsibility he had nothing to do with it\n[noise]\nAnyway so the magnet bomber hash tag is now the top trend again today as you might imagine and here's what some of these folks are saying\nMrs a dentist can Grimes my favorite part of this story is knowing that the mega bomber was mocking Maxine Waters for her low IQ on Twitter just before he left his own fingerprint on the bomb email to\n[laughter] that is pretty funny [noise] uh then they've got somebody's got a cartoon and his Trump I'm standing at the podium Trump twenty sixteen the head of Trump is a gasoline can and everybody out in the audience or matches\nThem then you go\nAnd Patrick ceases Jeff Sessions just said ... bomber Cesar ... may have been a part assume you think so Jeff which side\nSo they're going they're going they're nuts on then and\nRigid the regime Gabriel tweeted this and some of them remind me when Trump told everybody to mail bombs to Democrats\nYeah I don't recall that either then does carry Pena Baker says the far\nRight false flag narrative over the mega bomber of dams was all over talk radio that Jay Webber show given the history of these things in the extreme amount of venom poisoning the left I Do believe a false flag scenario is more likely\nI told you I thought anything could happen I said it's one of two things it some stupid redneck who loves Trump who's going nuts or somebody posing as a stupid redneck who loves drop who's going nuts but either way it's not so\nThey have it that's what that's that's the ah hash tag mango bomber narrative the day and they just oh my gosh they go oh here's one hashtags mega if you killed by the sword you blink by the sword\nNot fake news as real as Trump I'm not even sure what they're supposed to mean okay so we have that yeah I well\nWe have that now we have a man caught trying to steal the magnet Carter\nWith a hammer\nIf I had a hammer I'd
