{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Because within forty eight hours almost you see the money come out of the bank you know the IRA has received when you put a check in the mail and I really liked them type it's just a matter of wanting to delay it I even have a handful of people just want to wait to the very last minute to make sure that they\nDon't have to get the IRS money faster than necessary but you know the probably people forget to look in the bank a week later or it's been ten days I mean that didn't take that long for the Irish usually to receive and as soon as they received deposit money no matter if they resolve the issue or whatever else so\nVery very important if you're going to mail a payment to the IRS\nThen you need to make sure you start off by it so you can track when they received it and then check your bank\nAnd print out the front and back copy so you can make sure I had a gentleman that mailed it in\nThe received it they cashed it then you gotta love letter coming back and they said you never paid us and sure enough they deposit it because when he mailed it in he did not right on the check it sell where to apply it so they applied it to twenty sixteen which happened to be\nUm the year he had a balanced do the the oldest balance do but it was supposed to be the total amount to pay off his twenty Seventeen\nSo getting moved and read done is never as simple as doing it right in the first place so if you're ever Cindy money and you're not doing it to ... enough TPS\nMakes sure on the check itself even if you have to write a lot of information and make sure you're right the tax here the tax form and put the least the last four digits of your Social Security number on that check so that that gets separate it from the paperwork to iris they'll know where to put it or at least you can say had told you even if you make a mistake\nOr right back to the phone lines we go to spring Gary on to the doctor friday show Jerry Dr friday here for you\nOr your family I was calling things like that they are like out of the ... which is not as much as it was a whole lot less should be\nWhat we did lose three percent up to six percent if you're in two different tax bracket so you may be feeling that you're getting a little bit more on your paycheck which is kind of the point of the new tax code is to get people more money every week versus getting a big refund at the end that being said\nI Would be um [noise] I mean obviously if you've never had a problem in the past and you've always claim let's say married at one at\nThat has worked for you in the past it should not change in this current year uh but if you are married and there's two people working um you know might be the next three months you might want to go in there and just ask for a few extra dollars to be taken out\nYou know I'd rather have a little too much then you turn around and have to\nPay five hundred thousand dollars\nOf um when it's never expected so um you know you don't have a good answer that don't do your taxes so all I Would say if you think it's too much coming out one of two things settled extra money aside in a savings account so that way when you get ready to do your taxes you're prepared to pay a few extra dollars or\nGo to your um your payroll department and say hey I'd like to have an extra ten dollars a check or whatever you think I'm just to be on the safe side to make sure the iris has enough money you may find that perfect and you you know the tax because the average person should be getting about twelve hundred dollars a year I'm In additional money to live off of\nUnless the hundred dollars a month and maybe you're just not used to having all that extra money [laughter] okay well thank you so much\nRight playing a phone call Glen is we're just about out of time but you're on the year now is Dr friday go ahead\nYou're talking to me yes ma'am\nThat if I my question is this I got a letter this week from sharing the penalty for my Tennessee tax was late not my fault Senate in electronically my CPA did\nAnd I didn't go through and I didn't know until I got my bank statement I noticed that raw from down there and it didn't get paid then tell\nFive twenty six and they're charging may a penalty for being a light\nYou can contact them and based on your history but if you could possibly get that way because you've always paid on time and you know what human earth do happen though it does it I Would suggest the things one I Would just painted just that they don't continue to charge you more penalty and interest\nToo I Would certify a letter to see them a and requested to reevaluate the Cape and asked you know just tell them a little bit about what happened and asking the if they were way that I have had some success with estate much more with the IRS but um but it can't hurt to ask what's the worst they said no you already paid it anyway\nDo you suggest go ahead and pay it now and hope they will take it off\nYeah because if you don't they'll continue to add more penalty an interest in that they don't take it up then it costs you more than ... at least if you pay it now and then turned around and requested back they will refunded or apply it to your account for the next year whichever way\nUm but um I just think if you let it ride it won't freeze while you're talking they will continue to add more and more so it's probably better to pay first and then ask for it afterwards\nAlright what's fair about this my CPA was an era I guess not realizing that it wasn't paid so should she have to pay their her or me\nWell that's a good question if it in my from if it went through the check and it failed to go through your bank account I Would not be responsible because I did without those two I sent it at the ...\nAnd somehow it did not clear your bank uh but I Would normally if you're my client I Would write that letter request a waiver at least you might do something to try to help but other than that I Would not uh in that case I I probably would not be responsible for paying the penalty\nFor that All right well thank you somebody

[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\nThat but you know in in reality\nWhat we're looking at here is a situation where somebody is just ill prepared they don't know what to expect next to it was like I was was actually listen to this one gentleman talk about\nPlanning in general and I thought this is such this this stuff is so good you know what is the benefit of planning and he was just talking about how\nYou know part of the benefits of a financial planning is number one organization you know you can get someone to get more organized with their financial life journey to life in order I get things ... you know where it all together you know where it is and you know what everything is and you'll how things work together\nAnd he was talking about you know that he saw the benefit and we certainly see the benefit of accountability\nYou know when somebody commits to something you can help keep them accountable and I thought that was a really great point to and objectivity another part of it you know being able to help people around emotional decisions\nBut when I'm getting to here was part of it was one of the things he said that really hit me and he says pro activity\nAnd the part about that is what he meant was that as a plan or what you do is you help people anticipate financial life transitions and get prepared for them\nAnd I'll never forget one of the classes I took on retirement planning and this guy says be very sensitive to the fact that you're going to be helping people plan for a stage in their life\nThat they have never been through and that his retirement where they are not working and they're not earning a pay check anymore and they are relying on their investment portfolios and they're not in the workforce anymore he says but don't ever forget\nThat you've never been there either\nYou try and and and I thought you know that's very very true and I and I thought about this lot and I thought that you know isn't it interesting having done this for coming up on Thirty years\nI have clients many clients that have been in that\nIn our in that stage so I can speak vicariously from their situations and what I've seen and what are observed and I think that's one of the benefits of planning and being planners is not only that but we also have a tremendous amount of data on what to expect in retirement\nAnd this is one of those things to expect expect that there is a good shot that may be health will decline and you're going to have to have this type of care and realizing that this care is not cheap\nYou know Seventy eighty Ninety thousand dollars a year mhm and most people are ill prepared to be living on and this was a woman I Am talking about right here that has an income that is pretty significant I wanted to tell you use thirty five hundred and four thousand dollars a month\nOkay I think is there any ... you know so that's half of it's not terrible nursing home even in person used to living but that's when the point of view you know about that half\nAnd because of that this is the type of care that can be afford it on a level of income that for most people would be fairly reasonable right\nSo you've got to be prepared for this type of stuff so what do you talk about when you're when you're talking to people yeah they don't want [noise] I'm gonna cut you off for just a second 'cause I'm just realizing that I'm up against or break let me do this I Want to you and the other side of this [laughter]\nI Want you on the other side of this talk about so how do we prepare sure this type of thing actually literally important to get into that and Jim I Want to get your perspective on this as well listening to the investor coaching show or hear her talk Ninety nine seven delete CNN ... will be back right after this [noise]\n[noise] the possibility of lung cancer can be pretty scary especially for approximately ... million current and former smokers even higher risk that's why I see by the skin down wants you to know how to read too low dose E.

H. whole eight eight eight assistant family care dumped on\n[noise]\n\nWhen you're on the investors don't you can show them away from here and foreigners gym would [noise] case of the gym and talking about this long term care we're talking about in nursing\nHome sporting this stuff in retirement and what do you think there are some of your thoughts were\nWell definitely had some thoughts and just actually recently having this conversation multiple times\nAnd it it will really came to mind is what an issue of this is for for just a great multitudes of people because you have the people out there that just don't have a lot of savings don't have\nMany assets and they're going to add up on Medicaid take what they you know have to take and then you have people that have so much money that they can sell for sure but the great majority of people\nAre in between ... and there are the ones that really need to address this and really consider everything we're talking about in more and have these conversations\nUm you know with us with the long term care professional with their family that type of thing and and talking about policies that how they were priced in the past and the problems with the increase in premiums and things like that\nThe outlook doesn't look as bad well they still can definitely go up based on all these things we talked about there are much more likely to be priced ironically yeah these days are released a lot closer in terms of a more realistic\nOn assumptions about interest rates and the money that they're going to make on the bonds and that type of stuff and also it much better idea of what the claims are going to be and people keeping the policies and all that so\nThat puts it in a position of likely not having such significant increases in payments but it is it's a tough unknown you like to go in\nOne of the great things if you if you could just go in and know exactly what you're going to pay overtime and that makes the decision you know a lot easier than if well I Hope it's this and I hope it doesn't go up and that's a real big issue for people especially when you're trying to budget what isn't an insignificant X. men into your you know monetary output\nMhm yeah and I found that when I when I've been talking about people they actually expected something like a retention rate of like Ninety five percent one of the one of the courses that I took\nA ... at the American college they actually talked about that they had a retention rate they figured that that many people would hang on these policies and then when it was like Ninety nine percent of people held on the policies all of a sudden they said now\nThey've got and it does seem like it would be that big of a deal but it was a big deal in terms of the amount of claims that they had to pay out and that was problematic and they start raising the premiums significantly and from what I understand they're actually pricing them a lot more conservatively today with higher expected payout rates\nAre from what I've been reading on the topic so I think that's you're absolutely right it's it's one of those things that\nI that had to be addressed is finally being addressed the other issue is people are typically buying policies with shorter benefit periods\nAnd they're not necessarily trying to buy a lifetime benefits anymore\nNo you know for for no reason 'cause it's five years and had been most I see typically\nYeah it's prohibitive to go out and buy a lifetime been in there and are they exist anymore few companies have actually come out with policies and one I can think of\nThat actually has a ten year pay where you pay the premiums ten year now you're done\nAnd that I've always been a pretty big fan of for a long term care just pay it you're done if they have a premium increase in the future well it's that's their problem you've paid off your premium and you're done\nI and I think that there's something to be said for that right there what um what about you what you were talking about Evan during the break you were talking a little bit about the issue of the quality of care yeah also thoughts regarding that\nUm I I Will say I learned is when the hard way um but we've had family in\nSimilar conditions maybe not quite that squalid but\nPretty came mhm in early on in my career I talked with two or three clients that were in the same kind of a situation and kind of went gyms talking about I'm speaking as much to the people that have the money to pay for this right as the people the likely end up in a facility that's being funded by medicate okay\nRight right so some of these loyal London these long term care facilities that's where their funding comes from\nBut here's here's what we have found is human nature doesn't change mhm and the quality of care that your family member or friend receives nursing home\nIs directly correlated to the amount of involvement family has with that person ... if you are if you're visiting all the time if you're talking to the staff if you're bringing cookies if you just kind of the typical yeah human nature stuff\nYou could be a millionaire and if no you know if the kids never come to visit you're going to be living in those kind of conditions even if you paint that since you if you're in Medicaid facility in yeah your church groups are always coming over this and that you're going to be in a pretty darn good\nCondition and show me to me that's kind of a ray of hope is you do have a lot of control over some of\nThat stuff in and I have clients that are that have been in nursing homes are the ones that right now are the ones who passed away since but I Would go in there and I got to know the staff absolutely and you know it was it was really nice when you saw their family members in there as well\nYeah and and and unfortunately ... so it was pretty rare anything man don't get involved it over there right\nYou know because ... and then and that and the other thing is is that you know I had somebody from the state of Tennessee on the show\nAnd we're just talking about elder abuse in general yeah and that we have an obligation to report this type of stuff\nI you know there was actually a lot of worry years ago that if you report it and if it wasn't true that you could be held liable and and that you were\nYou could actually get in trouble for reporting somebody for something that they didn't do and in soil in the reputation so to speak something of that nature\nAnd she said no not anymore yeah you know if you see something going on you have an obligation to actually report to report this which I think and you won't be held\nLiable if it\nIf we invest in we find out it's not true we need like a hashtags senior me too movement or something you think\n[laughter] when you hear about facilities like that did you described and it's heartbreaking yeah and I'm sure they exist but I also you know it prompts to the ones that aren't that way for the people that are in that and it's tough\nTo care for seniors for Alzheimer's patients for those types of things and for the people would do that in the facilities that are truly caring truly doing good care and stuff like that I mean just all the props for those people in those facilities because they are out there to\nMy grandfather was in one for about five years in California and you know\nFor his situation and stuff they treated him very well and they took care of him there was some issues from time to time but because like Kevin was saying my mom would frequently go down and seeing my uncle would go in and you had friends that came into the work with and things like that\nThat is something needed to be done it was addressed and that was always address like and what I'm saying because somebody was bringing it up that it might not have if it\nYou know just if somebody was bringing it to anybody's attention because that's the one thing my grandfather wasn't going to bring it to anybody's attention\nAnd it's also you know it's I don't think about my my he probably hate me saying this but I'm gonna see anyway\nMy son would do this he would go down and he would go watch football with the guys at the nursing home on Sunday only fun oh yeah and in reality we can all get involved in that way you know from an investing standpoint let me just hit something that has been a topic over the past few weeks on and off\nAnd the topic is I've been talking about artificial intelligence and and you know robotics and and so on so forth I think you know we look at this and we say that a lot of these expenses are just out of control in nursing home facilities in assisted living facilities\nI think one of the interesting innovations that can be coming down the road and you guys know made the eternal optimist\nI think one of the interesting innovations is robotics and artificial intelligence and helping with care in facilities like this because you think about that I was I was talking to a gentleman this week and he's a business owner runs a swimming pool company\nAnd he had the most fascinating story about a a a dairy\nAnd he was talking about this dairy and just talk about how the cows moves through and everything was automated you know you wait the cows and and when the cat went in and you knew what it weighed you know we knew what it was supposed to way so if it weighed more when I walked into the barn\nAnd so this is a person that uh is way behind the eight ball mhm and called last week\nHey the US's up acts and we're only up X minus y mhm and so we have this link lengthy conversation well it's because you don't have everything in X here's why we don't want to change performance and so forth ...\nWell you know the president I think things are going you know this you know these assets categories that haven't been doing well they're holding me back and I've got to catch up 'cause I'm sixty eight ... and\nDon't have that much time to let it grow and I think us is going to be doing what you know just kind of right that conversation well us stocks are selling ... times what our national are amazing you know nobody knew to do better amazingly he was going into the category that happened to have the best performance over the last eight months\nYeah who yeah yeah yeah the endless common mistake that investors every you know I always you know professor rebalancing opportunity you also don't have enough time to make mistakes with\nRight just amount of money right in terms of you know now that you're trying to placate thing happened in Layton remember remember the late nineties when when this battle was being fought and you're sitting there going no don't do this don't do it and then over the next\nEleven years there is absolutely zero return for a larger without\nA diversified portfolio was only making Fifteen but us was making twenty eight you know like oh okay\nYeah but we don't want to do with that was the late nineties and going forward or are you in a way to zero in a negative return correct and diversified was just fine but ... it couldn't stop him chasing\nAnd uh you know and so that you know ... there's just an emotional component it becomes not an intellectual exercise for somebody at that point\nThey they can't think\nRationally and clearly mhm and there is any number of illustrations that frankly in society same thing with you know meet passion crispy cream I don't think rationally and clearly one of the red light on that [laughter]\nI Know that a good example reason I Know that it I I don't I have with your video [laughter] donuts\nBut well you know and so here's this person that's going to make a mistake yeah it has no time to recover from the mistake\nAnd that's it that's a tough\nThing to see especially when you relate the story of that's where they can end up because they have no assets and now they can't care for themselves we we can see that new anticipate that in\nIn the end the ... part is the investing industry they think they pray on eBay they they go and look what's going on look what's happening the media does it\nYou know the media does it because you know there that's that's all they know quite often I Would get to intervene they talk about the ... it's only thirty companies it's only thirty companies but you know if you look at the Dow in the S. and P. five hundred I Can't remember what it was I Want to tell you that\nThose thirty companies make up over forty percent\nForty percent right the U.S in the five hundred thirty companies out of five hundred companies and it makes up\nA man I Can't remember what it was just did the charge of ... percent I I don't remember how I you know what I'll pull it up for the next I'll I'll pull it up and and and I'll take a look at it in and tell you but\nI but it is it's an it's it's a tremendously high percentage of the S. and P. five hundred and then it's a tremendously high percentage of the entire stock market there there were these total market funds you guys have seen these before you know these these total market funds and you go okay well this this and this holds the entire market right\nAnd you

supposed to be doing whatever they're talking about and in fact\nThere's there's very there's a lot of times where you want to doing the exact opposite and even if the U.S and be fined hundreds of

was just I'm not here saying oh gee let's dump all you know all of U.S companies I'm not saying that I Know that's just yeah exactly this is that's the short side of the same thing as well\nAnd you know there's a reason that these companies are selling for such a high multiple compared to their earnings and there's some good stuff going on\nRight and then what happens is so often you'll have for example politicians that want to get reelected and you know you get it I I get it they want to say hey look we're doing good stuff\nAnd what's the evidence that we're doing good stuff the stock market but the point I always make with people as like wait a minute\nWe could have bad economic times and if we look back through history we've had some pretty nasty periods in time in our nation's history right where the economy hasn't been doing well at all but the stock market did just fine\nYou know that you can't use as a barometer for how the economy's going yet people make that mistake even people that should be well informed like politicians right you know that they make that mistake\nI'm so this is this kind of conversation I mean I I don't crunch the numbers nearly as aggressively in granular early as you do\n[laughter] you know I'm On board I consider myself a nerd [laughter] you know you are I mean literally whereas if you don't want I really enjoy\nAbout what we do yeah is\nWe can slice the day that any number of ways we want yeah and it comes back down to\nThe best thing to do is to diversify and rebalance not to I mean it just yeah it's just really gratifying that in an industry where at least my first you know Fifteen Years in the business was\nConstantly looking for the next best solution for my client there's a lot of well meaning people in the industry that are just clueless I used to be one of them you know right but eventually you get out of the you know you get out of that model but it's just you we can research all this stuff and it comes back to do exactly what we do I mean it's just fun\nIt is and the reason we do this the reason we slice and dice so much is because the only way that I've ever found to keep investors discipline is just continually educate them but it can't be borne you got to do it in a different way every\nTime just so that it isn't boring use a fish tank is ... ... and then using a fish tank as my fish tank workshop and that was fun I mean we had a blast with that you know is the most amazing thing is not that worried me a rather\nYou know what we are yeah we're going to do we're going to be teaching that workshop and I can't wait that can be a lot of fun to do that I still millionaires studies of millionaires\nOr for for head of the strike how ... how being a boring investor can make you rich I thought this was a good little article right here most millionaires don't rely on complicated strategies to attain wealth\nMore than three quarters of the typical millionaires portfolios held in base in basic mixes of bitcoin now [laughter] just joking with stocks bonds in cash no yeah really and you know what the most\nCited reason for success of wealthy people you know what they cited as the biggest reason for their success\nIs they gene constantly change stop\nOh I thought you were going to see they spent less than they may\nWell now that that would be good reason that's how they built another talking about investments cigarettes here yeah once they had the investments ... you know they they in essence said this uh they they said just one eighth of high net worth household even owns a hedge fund and by the way the data on hedge funds is abysmal so that means\nThat they're they're well advised not telling me things they've got monkey monkey throwing darts beating the hedge funds\nAre but they said well for one thing one of the biggest reason that they cited for their success was they actually stick to their strategies and they don't let markets wings or hot performance sway them\nAnd you know in reality\nThat's what it gets down to you know there are yeah they're all kinds of cool things coming out and you know if you look at some of the academic research over the past\nFew years [laughter] you know like for example profitability as a factor in investing in you know it's not what you think it's not you know only investing profitable ... but you can screen and holding\nA stocks that are have have lower costs for securities lending revenue and and and they're all kinds of really neat strategy so that there's a lot of ... I mean we over simplify a lot on this show here a lot of things going on underneath the hood that are really cool from an academic standpoint\nBut really by far and and a lot of that stuff is great for reducing expenses no question\nAbout it and that's why we use it yep and not you know using you know the indexes because of the capitalization waiting that we talk about and and not using its price weighted index isn't and things like silly things like that\nAnd not you know a lot of the um a matter of fact one of the things I just taught about I just finished teaching about was a smart beta investing\nIn literally what's going on in the adjustment industry right now\nIs you have these big investment firms taking some of the academic stuff that we talk about and using it as a marketing scheme and it is silly how they're doing it a matter of fact there's one that is actually\nUsing momentum which is one of those one of those things that they're talking about as being a great use of a of a vehicle to help\nReturns and in effect when things I was teaching was that the cost of actually training utilize momentum\nIs over ridden the cost of doing it overrides the benefit in all of these different uh the funds that are actually using this and then you actually have returns that are are in the negative versus benchmarks in other words when they utilize momentum even though there is a momentum effect\nYou know in other words an object in motion stays in motion and the idea behind socks and when they when they're in motion if they're on the way up they tend to stay on the way up which sounds really really bizarre and a lot of academics and they they shake their head and go\nLike starting drink do till they go down as those are the market diving and yet there\nSome effect to that but the thing is is you can't utilize it to any benefit in fact there are actually studies out there and you'll hear acted managers talked about this all the oh yeah active management adds value\n[noise] yeah but guess what the the price that you pay for the active management in terms of trading and management fees makes the alpha zero in other words there's no additional return to be had none whatsoever through and there are multiple studies that show this\nWell what happens is you have these people that come out there with his academic data and they're going to show you how beneficial beneficial it is but what they're doing is they're trying to sell a product with it and trying to use it to convince you to buy a product and you just shake your head and go is there\nIs there any intellectual honesty any place is what I have to ask myself\nAnd so often what is happening is some of this ... out of the academics are getting into the product sales game right and that's the that's their ... their ... yeah\nI Want on human we can't even read we can't take the humanity ... even the academic [laughter] so that's why I look at what we do is so exciting right because we're selling anything\nAnd ah the employer looks at me and go so far what do you recommend [laughter]\nAt that time until you guys I did not have an academic around to not have an academic background on investing topics and did not know in you know as a broker\nAnd you think you as a broker you're taught all of this stuff no no you know we were not tall we're taught how options were priced\nA really complicated stuff I mean there were a lot of really in depth topics that we were taught to get our series licenses but you know really the academics of investing putting ... that was not in there\nIt was here here are some things that you need to know and then when you went for training\nWhoever your investment company was that you worked for they were basically training you how to sell stuff right and that was primarily it\nAnd I'll never forget the employer looking to make a ... what do you think and I am I looked over the wholesaler and I says what do you think and guess what he uses the criteria for choosing investments in the four one K. I'll take\nPast performance for five hundred [laughter] you nailed it [laughter] I'm not give me five hundred [laughter] [laughter] okay Ira a year to ... dollars no you're exactly right that was exactly what was used as a matter of fact Jim was talking about being on a I'm\nAn a block and who is the of the investment advisor was asking questions of the fellow investment advisors\nAnd the question was hey you know I'm looking at choosing investments for my clients and I don't know what criteria to use what would you suggest and and these investment advisors were answering the question on the block and they're like well you dummy use past\nPerformance what do you what else would you use and [laughter] and\nWow you're really goes ebbs and um it made a comment somewhere along the line about how we were we started out we all started out there where we all started out on that side\nWho where we were real smart about this and then all of a sudden you know at some point we change in for me right does appear funny one so I really learned about the evidence behind all this yeah\nBecause just having a really data focus mine ... mine would just like wow this just makes sense I never have to apologize for choosing bad managers again right and so you know just to\nOr you always have to apologize for diversification though yeah when I met and re visitors visual know what I'm Talking about let's see if we do a joke about that as a matter of fact I had one of my one of my clients ... literally I'm not kidding he's a rocket scientist and he sent me something one day and he said\nThis is so you you got to use this and I laughed and and ah I read the article that he sent and they had that line and\nIt was about diversification means always having to say you're sorry uh-huh because there will always be something that's knocking the lights out and something that's underperforming but the reality is you don't know ahead of time\nAnd it was talking about successful successful people know about investing and I thought I Love that line diversification means always having to say you're sorry [laughter]\nAnd those of you that are younger are out there in the

I think the market's going to go up and they think it's a one hundred percent proposition but the investment industry knows that you don't believe in markets timing technically what Jim was talking about something called tactical asset allocation\nAnd what you're doing is tactically moving a little bit more this way or a little bit more that way based on what you think is going to happen if they really really had a bead on this thing Jim I mean they would just take all of the money out of stocks when the market was going to go down there and then put it all in cash and then when it was going to go up\nWell you won't have to ask for your money back to the investor owners are free\nFor you guys to learn and that's the whole idea that more educated you are as an investor [noise]\nNot going to get it it's hard to take advantage of an educated investor don't you think\nI mean and it very hard very hard\nAnd that's the whole idea is uh what was that last point you had another part of that that targeted I wanted to hear what the last part right there laughing about you know when we were talking about how turns and he's like man I did it to you again but you said market timing it doesn't work not even in target date funds who who would've thought\nRight there the other part of this was um do fun family objective hurt and a lot of these funds will all of these phones are built a from funds from within whatever fun family is providing the target date fund and know what this report talks about is there a body of research\nSuggests that fund managers tend to make investment decisions that help fund family objectives so they're trying to they're making decisions that benefit the company at ... at the expense of lower returns for shareholders have\nSeen if they see the fun they want to get some money in that fund and they will seeded with money because it has to go in that find if somebody's using the target date fund and\nThey talk a little later in this in the in the article first target date fund managers tended to favor started up by ... which had substantially lower returns over the next three years then alternatives with in their fun family so that's exactly your point\nYeah you know the one the most bizarre study I ever saw\nWas regarding find and what what they did or did they did is they had these multiple funds ... and the fun family would start up multiple funds these were not public funds mind you right there was set up these multiple funds name was seated was money\nAnd then what would happen is you know let's say that for funds and they find a B C and D and let's say that fun be had a greater return than a C. or D. and I'd better better returns ... how can you take away the mayor [laughter] it was like looking guy and I'm\nRunning around the ... so it is fun be\nHad a higher returns or what they would do is they would shut a C and D down uh-huh and they wouldn't make be public right and they were able to use the performance of fun being marketing even though it wasn't a public fund\nIran dad to me I'm telling you that this study goes back Twenty years you know and and uh and and\nYou still happened it just a practice that still goes on and we always teach every month when we do our workshop yup about survivorship bias yes so what does that well you know if you want to um if you want to make your fun family look really really really good\nThen what you ought to do is have hundreds maybe even since since ... instances on families have hundreds at least of different mutual funds and dozens in the same investment objective owning large us stocks for example\nAnd the reason they do that is because they know that some of those funds are going to do well some aren't going to do so well and if they have a couple of funds that do well just just do the luck\nThan they can go and market those things to the public and say hey look how good we are\nThat's the absolute same tactics that use in stock picking newsletters I'm so so newsletters that are just going to tell you pick this soccer but that stock and yeah sports betting\nSports betting services where people will call up and say okay who's gonna win between you know Washington in Philadelphia and they'll tell half the people Philadelphia have people Washington yep and then the next week they give them\nSomebody wins and that comes back for another picked and they give them another ...\nVersus New York and then they say well we think New York is going to win and ...

[laughter]\nThe advice of a [laughter] but he comes up to me at a at a chamber meeting and he goes oh man you know this is after the two thousand one two thousand and two oh sure yeah market meltdown\nAnd he goes man I you know I don't know how are you doing how you doing I'm like oh well and fine our values stocks are actually up at our small company stocks are actually up quite well I'm doing fine how are you doing man I've lost like sixty percent of my money\nHoly cow I was like and I I didn't but all I could think of as what happened to the strength of your big company here's even the worst part of it it sounds like a new relating this story yeah\nBut he didn't even know his mix could go down that far I Know he wasn't even aware of the risk now that he was taking regardless of the strength of the company no it sound like that caught him off guard and that's our business just to know that\nNow we never in you know you think about when we're brokers nobody ever talks about sharp ratios er or standard deviation or yeah you're right in and multi your standard deviation was you know if you ever talked about standard deviation was maybe three years at most\nIf you are halfway sophisticated but you know most people don't even do talk about that right you know a level of volatility this portfolio it might be a stand deviation for those who don't know that's the way of measuring the risk of a portfolio\nAnd ... and it's interesting because you can look at a portfolio and you know in a given year you know like for example one of the things that this guy said too because he was talking about having an and myself are they the guy was just talking about he made a comment regarding\nThe um\nI you know you know as a portfolio always going up I I Know I've got to be able to make more money\nWith you guys as is his comment and right going you know Joan ever you've got to look at time arises when you invest you know if I have a time horizon of less than a year for investing\nDo not go and put your money in stocks right it it doesn't make any sense to do that\nYes there is a three quarter shot that it could be up at the end of the year but there is that one quarter shot and if you really need that money\nYou really shouldn't be taking that risk in my humble opinion of ... of the stocks being down exactly now what happens is you have a time horizon you might have a one to three or time horizon I mean you could make a case for putting some stocks and the portfolio not a lot\nBut some ah you know if you're looking at three to five year time horizon before you got to spend the money you can make a case for holding a little bit more stocks\nAnd then you would in the one to three time arise you can make a case if it's you know six to nine years that you might be mostly stocks because historically speaking if if we diversify properly and we have all these different areas of the market the chances are you being up after six nine years extremely high\nChance the breaking even extremely low\nBut you know you always look in terms and what you're always doing as an investor\nAs you're trying to maximize expected return for a given level of volatility you can put up with and you know the interesting thing is there's a tremendous amount of academic research about how to do that that goes routinely ignored from an industry that just looks at past performance say this fun at the best performance by five year period\nRight yeah and it's frustrating oh yeah the uh you know after I\nWhat finally caused me to ultimately leave the dark side mhm was after some experiences with the large firms and so forth realized that wasn't working and then I couldn't pick funds and so forth\nBut maybe somebody could and so uh at the time a large research company was coming out with a portfolio\nA platform for advisors happened to be headquartered in Chicago ... people have lots of stars I think I Know who they are yes and uh\nSo started using that service I'd gone up to Chicago went through their process and so forth from the great you know they've got all the research and seven weeks after the first time I had used that portfolio\nWe get this email mhm back when email was a big deal like honey I got an email today is you noticed now you know [laughter]\nIt was it was a hunting and email it\nHey we're getting our email we are getting rid of diamond ... and we're replacing it was you know X Y Z mind mhm\nBecause of ex right I'm thinking well why didn't you by\nX Y Z fund three years ago and not hold on our heads great already you know and uh I mean that was my a ha moment was OK if these people can't do it mhm\nThen I'm pursuing something that can't be done I've got to go a different direction right right and fortunately I did\nA lot of times what happens is that you'll have a market downturn for a few years for example and then all of a sudden you know real estate became very very attractive and you know two thousand three two thousand for all of a sudden people can get enough he started talking about real estate because it didn't go down with technology stocks\nIn two thousand two thousand one two thousand two and by the way they're our stock asset categories that did you know fine during that period of time a value stocks in two thousand you know the first year at the tech bubble burst thing went up ten percent\nNext year they you know I'm not much they would have like three to four percent but they went up and then small companies you know shut up about thirty percent [noise] but you know the thing was that nobody was talking about those ethic categories in the late nineties right you know all they could talk about where were you know large gross companies\nWell and then what what the industry does your ... circling back to our wholesaler kind of a thing yeah is now real estate's doing well among wholesaler comes out and says you know if you had ten percent and real estate your portfolio would have done ... the last year I only with ten percent\nEnd Mr advisor\nThis limited partnership pays seven percent commission to I mean just so I'm feeling like wow I can do better for my clients\nAnd helped my eye seven percent right and it's not an evil thing exact okay we're not making a moral\nValues statement about the people in the industry it's the model itself and so all of a sudden people move into something that's doing well and then it's kind of liquid you know I mean just the cycle perpetuates itself but clients are just caught in the middle that yeah\nAnd and you know a lot of times when people do is they I've I've heard advisors go well you know there's this product out there and it guarantees you can't go down and gives you some upside of the market and my client wants to why shouldn't I offer it to them right and it's you know the reality of it is is is\nYou know when when somebody says I can give you return and there's no risk I I often hearken back to if the insurance company says that they can give you return with no risk they're using your money\nAnd they're paying you to use your money and they're telling you that they're going to pay you a high rate of return to use your money hey either they're really dumb and they don't realize that can use your use your money at a lot lower price\nOr they're misleading sometimes it's not the advisor ours are misleading you it's it's their their employer who's telling them to sell this product and the advisors holy on aware because they're not that well trained exactly and that's that's the problem\nAnd he had this whole thing where the insurance industry was just by shutting down the use of index annuities and investment news the beginning of this month comes out with this article saying indexed in indexed annuity sales grow among wire houses I be days and I and I think it's a phone call\nIn and at first they're they're they're demonizing these products and see this is terrible this is terrible this is terrible\nThen look and go oh wait a minute these guys are salt making a lot of money selling this stuff maybe we're missing out on welfare missing out there\nThis thing out on the big gravy train of the indexed annuity sales and now they're deciding that hey death the fiduciary rule that was going to say that's\nThat's why you have a spike in\nYeah we don't have to keep your best interests at heart anymore and in in its market I mean if you look at they've got a chart in this article showing how much they've spiked any it's it's significant\nI used to live near a you know when it went down I used to live near ... and when everyone had Proctor and gamble\nOh yeah you know well yeah yeah there there's another Kroger but when it went down that gee he stock oh yeah I you know the the funny thing was is she sold a bunch of it by accident and\nWhich is weird mhm I don't know if she didn't mean to tell a broker to sell it or what on earth was but she sold a bunch of it and what ended up happening is the stock went down from fifty three down to below ten dollars\nFor a while and she was and she was out and she she was saved good she was saved from that eventual out and it was a it was here yeah now just to be clear you know in any legal strategy there's always not I won't say downsides but you know you have to consider both sides of the coin\nThis would have certain rules that might be different if you're in the event of a divorce\nYou know now all of a sudden this ash that's going to be split according to the terms of the trust not necessarily according to the terms of some divorce decree you know so mhm you have to kind of look at all of these kinds of things but the point is that there's some planning tools out\nThere they may not have and you don't never go I Am twenty million dollars but there's things out there so yeah yeah good point to bring that up you're listening to the vest coaching show right here on super talk Ninety nine seven

... kept\nSaying to exceed any expectation Ernie dream I could've ever had about a hospital I was told we wouldn't get a bill or I didn't quite process that houses partial partial through a wonderful people who don't age and I don't know if they are aware of what they do\nThey're saving children's lives every day\nSaint Jude children's research hospital I'm finding cures children learn more at St you done to work\nIs your dream of Jeannie or something like an Egyptian walking like an Egyptian bangles your walk like an Egyptian dance concert back in a while I was in the\nMarine Corps dance like that [laughter] and then even dance in the booth [laughter] right [laughter] right [laughter] oh my goodness so\nAll right so are you like do you like love getting these taxing so let's talk a little bit about Andy or tax planning yeah and some of the things that you're that you think of towards the end of the year I I I actually had a a topic yeah not too long ago talking about you know giving\n... you know in a state planning instead of naming the charity in your will you know maybe having a charity inherit deer and knew a tea or something that is often Gary Gray strategy I had a very bad thing to inherit ... ah from attack standpoint so\nHuman yeah yeah if you're handling exactly a great for charities bad for human [laughter] talk talk a little bit about you know\nCharitable giving so you know some of the strategies for IRAs and things\nYeah so we're ... you know we're kind of coming into the the fog getting into the you know last quarter of the year ... and of course we're always talking with clients about making sure they get to require minimum distribution if they're over Seventy and a half out of their IRA because no one wants to fifty\nPercent excise tax mhm um but you know the one of the things that was made permanent in the law change last year was this concept of\nA charitable distribution from your IRA mhm as part of your required minimum and distribution Japan the neck you had to sit there and wait are they gonna do it right and we knew what they can renew it\nFinally so we've been processing a lot of those yeah ah for our client or a strategy and yeah I mean it's just wonderful and so basically so explain it isn't getting a trickle down to if you haven't taken your distribution dishes out there okay but here's the deal with it and if it up and explain it because people item ... versus people using\nStandard adoption 'cause maybe\nPeople don't under showed us some of it has to do with the taxation period and I'll I'll touch on that but it also affects Social Security so even if you weren't itemize ing before mhm they're still benefits to that\nYes so let's let's just say that when they weren't you know you have to take let's just say you have to take twenty thousand dollars out of your IRA mhm\nAnd you only want to be you and your typically giving ten thousand a year to charity for you just use those numbers\nPreviously if you take twenty thousand out of your IRA and it runs through your fingers\nEven if you you know the duct ten thousand dollars maybe off your tax return if you itemize them it affects the taxation on potentially your medical insurance expenses the taxation on your Social Security and all those kind of thing yeah\n'cause it gets part a provisional it was part of your in your part of your income mhm if you take a charitable distribution and just send ten thousand directly to the charity mhm\nAnd the check is made out to the charity from your IRA doesn't run through your pause you might mail it to them you know but it wasn't made out key ... okay\nThen that ten thousand just doesn't even show up on your tax return and so now instead of even needing to itemize I still get that folded auction I get my full standard deduction\nI still don't show the income on my tax return now it lowers my provisional income mhm now maybe none of my Social Security is taxed and various things I mean it's just yeah a lot of tremendous advantage is the only downside is the government gets less revenue\nAnd people don't think about it that you can lose your charitable deduction when you're using the standard deduction because it's not part of it so yeah you know that's it's a win\nSo it's just kinda yeah just kind of a win win it's you know the downside is you have to sign a form typically freer provider to make the distribution of the charity small price to pay to distant here at the IRA sure that it goes straight to them no problem with that yeah exactly so that's just something to be aware of is we kinda get in towards year end\nBut along the same lines something that a lot of times parents don't think about ... you know 'cause here we're talking about you know people that are over Seventy and a half were you know that's the grandparent stage\nA lot of parents have been making college visits their children are maybe starting to get acceptance letters are filing their declaring they want to go to the school or that school all the FAFSA and your ability to collect student aid for your child for college\nIntegrates very tightly with your tax return for the previous year so right now if you have particularly if it's your first child or maybe now you'll have two kids in college\nSome of your year in tax planning is going to affect\nHow much financial aid you qualify for next year next September when your kid child goes to school um and so there's some things that you just want to be aware of if you're maybe looking at selling a piece of rental property you know not typically you're home because we get so much we can exclude so much game that's not a big deal [noise]\nBut you know somebody called the registrar and the transfer agent mhm does keep\nTrack of all that stuff that's ... that to me there ...\nYears the unsung heroes of the invent real I you know and you say that but you know I always tell people that one of the beauties of ... you know what\nMakes an economy run is that you have people that protect your property rights right and they will make sure you get what is yours and that to me is an unsung\nHero I agree you know what I mean the and I look at the police I look at at at the you know people that are in the jobs that do this time I look at military and I I think you know what makes\nYou know what makes America and capitalism around the world run as property rights protection it yes it is you cannot over emphasize that and uh that's really nice so you had some that you couldn't even find the did you ever track it down or\nNot yet I mean these are still work in progress so in three months or so we'll all frankly let you know how it turned out but in a couple of these we were able to call the record keeper mhm and that's usually what the qualified plan you know if you have a four one K. we looked at the company we were able to track that they were still in business right and\nUh so we're trying to reach some people there in the human resource department to track it down to the record keeper didn't have a record of my clients social you know they didn't find the account wow so we're still going through one way\nUm but what's his other clients actually a custodial account that we're looking at\nAnd so now that's actually in the you know their child's Social Security number technically yeah um but there's a few things you can do if you find this number one you know you can try to track down the investment firm mhm um one thing you can do is the IRS God Bless them has a phenomenal\nRecord keeping system\nAnd so you can contact the Internal Revenue service\n... you know once they verify your identity and so forth or you could use something called the foreign ... one that is not an area I ever would have thought of that country is you know if somebody were sending ten Ninety nine for nine years you know to this Social Security number ... they'll have a record of that meant so you could at least\nTrack down okay when did that\nStop you know did you quit getting ten Ninety nine thousand two thousand and five you know what happened so that's one source is give them the information and see what's in your tax transcribe ... um\nThere's also you could go to the Tennessee and claimed property department you know if you just Google that's what I've heard on claim properly tendency or the state you might have lived in California Indiana whatever\nA you put in some information and they can find out if there's property in yours or your child's name you have to put in that you know that tax information ultimately\nUm but that's one way to find out ... some of these may be so old that they have she did back to the state\n... I'm I frankly don't know tendencies achievement rules or you know that's why attorneys have jobs but right um you know if any civil dis the ownership just reversed the state potentially\nUm but it's just been you know so we're going to try to track these down but most people don't think you know they might know about the unclean property thing they wouldn't think to contact the IRS to get a history of\nWhat's been presented for you or your son for ten Ninety nine and when did that end yeah you can give 'em a range of years yeah I'm frankly you could give your tax person power of attorney to do for you that make costs you more than ... accounts were you ever gone to\nI've had people say that they've actually gone and looked and they found assets\nI have I've found assets for me yeah um I'd found years ago like an old insurance commission yeah Indiana you know as you know it was like six hundred bucks but al ... people doing it um I'm actually found um for me as well this was like an old\nGas utility deposit you know that I'd made when I Move I think I've heard several hundred single doctor all heck yeah OK whatever and um so I Would encourage you to\nPut your information in your ... you find you know it's a kind of good to do on them you know snowy day if we ever have a snow day down the road ... did you really say that moved along clean property while your kids are home from school [laughter]\nThat's interesting now a one last thing I was I was going to talk about the ... I've heard I've seen a lot of talk about safe stocks and there was an interesting article in investment news about a safe stocks bike alarming Wall Street\nDemand for defensive asset cast shadow over Bull Run was was the ... you know folks when somebody is out there marketing something to you and saying this is a safe asset\nYeah typically what they're doing the dividends have been you know like the wrong give it in his strength or something like that remember that just because the stock has a strong David in history does not mean at all that they will continue I I've seen companies with a strong evidence paying histories be so scared of stopping their evidence\nThat they were literally start borrowing money\nTo pay that evidence oh wow which puts them in huge financial risk\nAnd you know cell and that's one thing and you know I've had this I've had a bunch of these types of conversations over the past couple of weeks where people say you know this guy is recommending that I invested in these stocks I paid dividends and and I have to point out I go okay dividends are a subset of earnings guys you know\nDavid in this part of your earnings if they give it in this high compared to well it's party earnings but it's going be high compared to what\nAnd I I Try to get the kind of say well share price the price of the stock very good if the evidence is high compared to the share price and markets are really good at pricing stuff properly you have to ask yourself why the price the stock is low\nThe price the stock is low why because the companies could be in distress do you think it really makes a lot of sense for you to go buy a bunch of stocks in companies that are in financial distress\nIt's a lot of marketing it was just a lot of marketing and I guess that's for me that's a big thing about this industry there's always so much marketing going on you know for\nWas hiding the truth you know there's nothing wrong with pursuing value stocks as a group of absolutely understand okay that's a risky category and I'm expecting to get compensated for that risk yeah don't chase what you think is a safe does it end\nWhich really is chasing a risky asset category yeah oh I remember going through it with your eyes open\nHowever I talked to walk into my office one day than a dear friend and climb for many many years but I'll never forget\nThe day he walked in my office with a book in his pocket and\nHis first time you've ever having any comes in and he's got his what kind\nDogs of the doubt that you've had this guy a while yes [laughter] Hi you know\nQuite a while there are [noise]\nEm you know we got lots of stories\nAbout investing in the ... are very they're following player the investor coaching show\nHere with a dot com is the website [noise]\nCheck out the video and it's the one year anniversary for that too many videos on the west by\nInvestor coaching shows to protect\nHi I'm jak jumps and found are just some comfort shoes if you have foot pain or discomfort in most cases it's related to inadequate foot where and support my goal is quite simple it's about leading you to a path of comfort\nCreating improve foot environment\nWill reduce or eliminate your foot thing\nThat just some comfort shows a white bridge road we have solutions for almost every issue remember foot comfort is very important for quality of life\nCheck out her testimony on the Web ... dot com\nAre veterans were there for you everyday to ensure our way of life [noise] let them know you can join me as a pro supporter of our veterans Hi this is Joe Montana and on the one hundredth anniversary of Veterans Day help no vet alone improve the lives of those who have served our country\nPlease show your support and text V.

modules so that all the auto makers could work together for a safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source of all they do a better job at that and then actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can't even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now [noise]\nBoy I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of wave
