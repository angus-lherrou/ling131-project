{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Welcome back listeners just as Dr Brian Foley alternative doctor and again I knew one hundred percent interest in in my office that's how I get people well\nPeople will\nGet them from a well with our subject is a diabetes or high blood sugar and\nWe reverse that at my office believe it or not that can be reversed that's what we're

that comes through the door that ah I'm not able to handle health wise and handle it naturally\nNow it's not a miracle cure none of this was a miracle cure it takes time it takes effort it's a two way street I'm going to give you some things you need to do outside the office a there'll be some things you need to do inside the office or but it is doable it's doable system\nAnd the worst thing you could do a with a health condition is nothing believe me it's going to get worse and worse as time goes on\nA there's only two two things that happened on this planet either get better or you get worse nothing stays the same\nSo it's going to get better or worse depending on what you want to do with it but you can come to the workshop you don't have to have a health issue I'm always pushing the health issues but I get healthy people coming into they just want to stay healthy or at least they think they're healthy ah there's a few there's always a few things we could tune up on somebody that are in good shape\nI'm so is this Saturday it's absolutely free uh it's it's going to be October the thirteenth It's MORNING workshop all you have to do is call six one five\nThree three three zero zero five six six one five\nThree three three zero zero five six\nOr a call that a number of there and uh it it goes to a voice mail so nobody's gonna answer it and just leave your name and your

three three three zero zero five six\nAnd leave your name number nobody's going to answer the phone but I'll have my staff give you a call on Monday or Tuesday comes from your seat and um let you know that uh we have your seat reserved\nA it is one of those things that you will never regret that you did and if I can guarantee two things you come to the workshop you're going to hear things you've never heard before not even on the radio and\nIf you take action on it it's going to change your life and that's what we do at my office we change people's lives\nYou know we have people that can't play with their grandchildren uh they're in constant pain they can't get out of bed or we handle those things are ... the quality of life can change dramatically over a period of time if it's approached a properly and handled properly with nutrition\nUh I've had some people come in and they said all uh I I I used to enter process from other doctors are well that's good I'm Glad the other doctors are using that but they don't use it with the approach and the technology that we have in our office to find these things\nYou know uh we have a saying in our office that what other doctors find hot hard to handle\nIs easy for us to handle there's a system on how to handle it and uh we do that at my office\nSo called six one five three three three zero zero five six reserve beer a seat now or leave your name your number and we have to have your phone number so we can call you back\nAnd the number of people you'd like to bring six one five three three three zero zero five six and again you're going to hear things that you've never heard before a how we're gonna handle health conditions and if you take action on it\nA meaning that you do something about it like come to the workshop it'll change your life and that's what we do at my office as we're changing lives all the time every time [noise]\nAll right we were taught going back to a talking about high blood sugar\nAnd you might come in with high blood sugar if it's if it's um uncontrolled high blood sugar ah well my first request will be to get you want to some medication\nBut again we want to look at that medication as a short term solution not a long term solution we're looking at it Tobias some time now high blood sugar can do a lot of damage to your body and again you may have high blood sugar right now and not even know it\nWhat you need to do is get what you get you one of those monitors you can go to any drug store and buy one\nOr just look for the strips you want to know what the cost of the strip soccer's that's going to be your biggest a lay out\nOf the almost give you the monitor for free but a look at the Scripps you know a dollar for her strip or fifty cents or Seventy five cents per strip is pretty good\nUh and then I start monitoring your blood sugar you know you get a little Lance it's not a hard thing to do some people I Can't uh\nI don't want to a pope my finger and get the blood out well there are certain ways to do that where it doesn't hurt for some reason all the directions that I've seen when you get these monitors is the pope the the tip of your finger well that's where all the nerve endings are using the tip of the finger\nYeah where do you want to do is you want to get on the side of the finger or the nerve endings are aren't a aren't that the U.S side there's nerves in there but they're not as a tender not as sensitive as that the tip of your fingers\nSo you always you do it on the side of your fingers and you drop out just a little bit of blood and you can monitor your blood sugar\nAh so everybody should be doing that especially with the food we're eating you would be shocked and surprised at where your blood sugar should be and where your blood sugar actually is\nSo to know a would be to be able to take action and start changing things so we get a lot of people in our first concern when somebody comes in there's two concerns on blood pressure on blood sugar one is deliberate self deliberate self handles a lot of blood sugar\nA lot of times people that wake up at night because they can't they can't sleep at night they have to uh they wake up a is due to a deliver not handling blood sugar properly so there's a lot above blood sugar that's handled\nIn the um and deliver\nThe other organ that we are concerned about a course in the ... which makes insulin [noise] All right we're going to take another short break we'll come back we'll talk about the\nPain Chris we're talking about insulin and we'll talk about uh met foreman are and how that all works and how can we actually not stay I met form and for the rest of your life and what happens if you do\nDo that after the ...\n\n[noise]\nThis program stretch to provide accurate and trustworthy information be advice given on this program is based on a short description of symptoms given by the color and has given with the understanding that neither the station or the host is offering a diagnosis or cure for any health related condition no sickness or physical\nDisorder can be accurately diagnose to the format of this program does anyone seeking advice should consult with their own medical professionals before pursuing any tears procedures are treatments suggested on the radio\nMaybe it wasn't my problem with your minds project mom one's ten\nNineteen\nReact to them and even if they can still do\nOr you're going to have a some problems with your eyes a diabetes can lead to eye problems it's the retina and the guy uh can't take a whole lot of sugar course kidney disease is is a big one a this is these are the reasons that I Would recommend somebody get on net foreman for short period of time\nAre we trying to avoid all of this kidney disease cardio\n... disease which of course there's no one has heart disease diabetes is associated with high blood pressure if you have high blood pressure um you could become diabetic also high cholesterol and I can guarantee you if you have high cholesterol and you're on a stand drug\nUm if you've been on the stand drug for more than a year your chances to be come diabetic are sixty Seventy percent of people that are on a stent drug for more than a year your risk to become diabetic goes up sixty to Seventy percent [noise]\nMatter of fact we have a diabetes is a deadly disease I Need to tell your story about a friend of mine had this friend he was diagnosed with diabetes or he used to come to my office and you'd work on the computers for me and ah we would trade off I'd give him my services and he would give me his services he knew about computers and I knew about bodies\nSo he wasn't following following my advice or like you should have and uh he was working many hours at another place I worked at for computers any work third shift so I wasn't really taking that good care of himself\nA I've recommended many things for him to do but what happened was um\nHe he started getting these a diabetic officers and they would not heal up\nSo uh what they did is they after a while they wouldn't heal up so guess what they do they cut us off\nAnd then they cut his foot off then they cut his leg off up to the knee and they were trying to get it to heal up that put them in a oxygen tanks and all that kind of stuff um and again by that time uh it's too late to really get a good grasp on it\nSo one day I I call I says well I Wonder what happened to his name was recognized as I Wonder what happened to Rick and I called up to his house to see how Rick was doing because after a while he was homebound ah he was laying on the couch and I would stop at his house now and then in a given adjustment or if you'd call and I'd come go up there and give them an adjustment\nAnd or hadn't heard from him for a while and I called and his wife says well or he died last week\nAnd that was the first time this was probably about Fifteen or Seventeen years ago that was the first time I realized how deadly\nHigh blood sugar is and that's because he didn't take care of but a lot and he didn't follow my advice now one thing you can't just come to my office and expect to take a few few pills and everything will be a fixed a war is a two way street we've got some work ahead of us especially if you're coming in with a high blood sugar\nAh but these are things that are associated with um with with diabetes or high blood sugar high cholesterol\nOr know your life expectancy now there's two types of diabetes type one which you could say you were born with it or there's some damage to the pancreas and it no longer makes insulin\nUh there's type on a ... in my office we're not going to fix that I don't know any way that they can fix that unfortunately that's permanent damage now I had a gentleman come in on this was last year he came in he was on twenty five a units of insulin\nDiabetes diabetic type one and when we were done um he was on less he was on ten to twelve units of insulin uh when we were done so that's a great when right there you didn't have to take as much a insulin because it's the insulin that will eventually catch up to you or the met foreman\nIf you're just relying I met foreman and thinking hey I got this thing under control because I take my met foreman a no that's not the way that it works on the medication becomes a problem if your diagnosis type two diabetes um your you have a twenty year early death\nSo type ... one is on the average about Twenty years you die earlier you lose Twenty years of your life let's put it that way type two\nAre you going to lose ten years of your life ten years that you will no longer be able to see your grandchildren no longer be able to see your children uh ten years is cut off and that comes from the uh you cake key statistics on diabetes the life expectancy so a type\nTwo unfortunately uh you're going to lose ten years and that's the one where you can change that around\nAnd reverse I mean like we do in my office all the time [noise]\nAll right we're going to take a short break we're talking about a blood sugar diabetes and we're talking about a medication and how we're going to fix it\nWith your Mayo Clinic radio health minute I'm Vivian William women with breast cancer often\nFaced with difficult decisions not only regarding a treatment mastectomy or lumpectomy but also their future risk what about my other breast\nIncreasingly these days women who are diagnosed with breast cancer from one breath do decide that they wish to have you had the breast removed\nIt's been a huge area of controversy in the media\nAmong press societies and women nationwide that's\nDespite evidence that their risk to the other ... is pretty low so it can be a tricky landscape for providers who are canceling when that's why Dr Judy belly and a team of researchers went back and surveyed more than Thirty Years' worth of patients about their decisions that the second breast removed and whether or not to undergo breast reconstruction\nWhat we found was that people were relatively happy with whatever they decided to do\nSo her advice is simple listen to yourself\nAnd make the decision if that's\nFor Mayo Clinic radio I did in Orleans\nOr life with Dr Sam ... book [noise]\nI Can't even believe this is the thing\nNow it's got an e Snapchat this warfare

Canada or doctors are told not to prescribe met foreman for people that have high blood sugar if they have\nImpaired kidney function or impaired liver function because it it's going to work on the kidney liver or heart failure\nIf you're a heavy drinker you shouldn't be on met foreman\nAnd I think these could hold true in the United states to if you're pregnant or you shouldn't be unmet foreman if your breast feeding you shouldn't be on met foreman I don't have to worry about those two myself\nOr if you're over sixty years old according to the Canadian Medical Association guidelines for met Forman you should not beyond that form and if you're over aged sixty\nOr at least in Canada okay in America could be different and I'm sure it is because I got a lot of people there I met foreman they're way over sixty years old\nNow met foreman and we have some other problems with met form and not just the um side effects\nAre there are interactions with met foreman and there's modern interactions with at least Seventy four different medications now there is no list of medications but Seventy four\nMedications will interact moderately with net foreman there's mild interactions with at least eighty seven different drugs\nSo you gotta watch out these other drugs the interactions between these drugs in most cases most um pharmaceutical companies do not study the interactions between drugs\nAre so you don't really know um but they found that there is a moderate in interaction between at least Seventy four different medications and mild interactions with at least eighty seven different medications\nAre unmet forming by the way that if you want to know how met foreman works it decreases the flow of sugar production out of the liver so targets delivered to stop the flow of a sugar out of there\nNow in my in our office we start up people out again when you come to my office we're going to find the weakest area if as the pancreas great if it's the liver which we have to work might not be the first thing we have to work on but we have to work on a almost every one sliver that comes in our livers or working overtime [noise]\nUm but if we're trying to bring blood sugar down there's a couple of things that would want to do we want to handle the glancing Oregon's make sure that they're um good and strong and then we're going to be targeting certain areas uh one of them is going to be deliver we've got to make sure that delivers is a strong\nA program cleaning up delivered getting them a allergy free um they were able to go over and visit their grandchildren I've had people that want it to travel and couldn't travel they couldn't travel because they were too sick\nOr and they were able to uh now um be able to travel and stay healthy I got people that uh they get sick all the time I get sick this time of year every year well uh we put an end to that too because now they don't get sick anymore\nSo there's all kinds of things and there's

need to come to the workshop I've had people or do the survey which is a good start it's better than nothing but um they end up at the workshop and uh they just want to get better and better\nAnd that's the way it works so six one five three three three zero zero five six six one five three three three eight zero zero five six uh to come to the workshop they're\nAll right we've been talking about um a diabetes\nAnd we were talking about how we handle that are in my office and what we want to do is if somebody comes in with a diabetes that is not controlled would want to get them on the medication but we want to look at that medication is a short term solution not a long term solution\nOr one of the most popular medications for diabetes is a met foreman\nA met Forman doesn't work over a period of time they usually put you on insulin\nNow being an insulin I gave you a a a story about a person that came in he was type one diabetes now we're not gonna ever fix that unfortunately for those people\nAre so you will need to use insulin he was on twenty five units or when we started in when we were done I he was down to twelve units and that really really\nWill extend his life the problem is when you're on these medications\nIs that they uh become the problem or not just the high blood sugar ah but the uh medication itself like insulin is a hormone but your body is supposed to secrete that out your pancreas is posted secrete that out\nSo if you're taking insulin so you're taking it I'm In a a liquid form which is a shot\nOr or some other form now they have insulin pumps which I think are a little better than just you physically doing it all the time um because they will slowly secrete it out just like us sort of like the body does\nBut here's some side effects on insulin a low blood sugar can make it too low course weight gain is a big one with a blood sugar that person I told you about their insulin went down a\nA was cut in half basically went down to twelve units a day he lost about thirty pounds awesome weight gain a rash\nAnd all those kind of me\nAll right well we're coming to the end of the show I Do want to remind you are to come to the workshop

disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's osteoporosis and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium ... too so it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that\nYou need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd the cats sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relax your body and you do actually

muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious\nCircle that I like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that starts to take the calcium out of the bones just start cutting bone loss you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah in your body is actually starting to manifest\nAt well all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down this great absorption rate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your blood strip\nAll right and

is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health\nSo I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of this because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing to do their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late [laughter]\nDon't your biggest you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain calcium\nAnd neither is excellent for back pain because\nThe calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve and when you take us combat formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back mhm and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period and it it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this comics formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't it amazing we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a a candidate to lady who was suffering from

the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize her really just to the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made it out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use is what the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that the medication as\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium may need them in the system\nWell do the very drugs that are treating the

ache now there's a lot of people listening who have been diagnosed with al ... which is a thinning of the bowl ... but again a vitamin D deficiency\nBig one is muscle weakness so you try to get up from a couch you get in and out of a car and you're finding it more and more difficult and that will lead into the high high prevalence of people fall in and injuring themselves\nOh okay All right which is a huge problem right exactly and\nThe other one is you tend to get more calls especially upper respiratory problem okay problems with blood\nPressure cardiovascular problems digestive problems caused the patient bloating yeah mhm that's very very common and if you're a diabetic there's all kinds of data about being the fishing and vitamin D and the list goes on and on it's a huge problem what\nDoes vitamin D actually do in the body what does it used for\nWell what do we use the word vitamin it's actually kind of a misnomer because vitamin D is actually a hormone okay and that regulates thousands of genes in the body everything from the same blood sugar immune system blood pressure falling string\nPlus ... has been linked to maintaining whole and healthy\nBreast across an ovarian health but I'll tell you what the way we're taking vitamin D is all wrong it all messed up\nWell why do you say that why is it messed up\nWell first of all did go to your doctor and they got a

concerns about the issue is even if you're trying to get vitamin D back in your body you're most likely taking the wrong type or the wrong form of vitamin D the wrong way maybe not even getting enough of it\nAnd Dr biggest why don't we start here by talking about you know why is this deficiency such an epidemic despite all of the awareness and the products that you see on the store shelves containing vitamin D\nBoy that's a good point Seventy percent of us in this country\nAre deficient in vitamin D the fact is is that your body needs vitamin D this is a hormone that should be there and

it's one eight hundred for seven six five six three zero\nSo how about if folks me what it really comes down to here is we're not getting the right form or enough\nVitamin D delivered the right way which is why we have so many of these health concerns that you probably can't put your finger on and Dr biggest I Want to start just re camping here that there are a couple of different forms of vitamin D and maybe explain\nWhy the typical form that you would find in most off the shelf de formulas is different from what you put together here\nWell there's vitamin D too and there's vitamin D three and the two is the type of vitamin D that has to be activated by your body still has to be converted into vitamin D three\nVitamin D three is the activated form\nSo it's ready to go to work now the the three that I use my formula I think it's\nThe best because I've seen the best results with myself and my family with my patients plus I've worked with a lab where the people in the lab of taking this and they they test their blood every day to see how the dean is going to end up going up and out through the rough where it should be\nWow so Dr biggest I mean who should consider taking your fast melts vitamin D formula\nWell I Would definitely start with kids for development\nAnd the humidity obviously young adults in their twenties need vitamin D to keep their immune system strong men the men and women in their thirties you're talking about higher health immunity cardiovascular problems start to turn on but it's also the child rearing years and vitamin D for pregnant women is\nVery important ... people in their forties [laughter] that's the way you know you start seeing more of those aches and pains like you've never felt before you think you're getting older and again it's important for your hormones and to keep yourself physically active\nAnd when you're in your fifties you start feeling sick or you can't golf he can't play tennis you know you start becoming aware of your body not functioning mhm\nAnd then people over ... the I just wish that every senior citizen would go on this formula imagine living in your senior years where you have confidence in your balance and you're you're able to have the energy to get things done\nThe night of clarity\nYou know this is more and more important as we all want to because people are living longer but the quality of life is not great\nYou know is it ever too late Dr pick is such that your fast melt the three formula wouldn't be a worthwhile investment\nIf you can see the breath or in the mirror in the morning and then you know that you're a candidate for this because a lot of the things that people suffer from their suffering from a lack of this vitamin in their body so it's never too late to try something like this and the sooner you can get on my formula the better I you're going to have of having a really\nHealthy high energy high mobility life from here on off\nYeah well it makes it a lot of sense and documenting is looking someone expect when they start taking your fast melts the three formula\nWhile you're going to notice within the first several days that something is changing your body

sure to join us again next week for another great show I'm Chris McKay have a great day everybody\nWith your Mayo Clinic radio ... minutes Vivian William peripheral artery disease or\nP. H. D. can be a sign of something really seriously wrong with your heart or blood vessels so guess what is P. A. D.\nEverybody's familiar with the ... blockages that can affect the heart\nAnd give us heart attacks or the kind that can affect the vessels in the neck in the brain and might give us a stroke it turns out that those problems these what we call plaques or areas of cholesterol and calcium deposition not only occur in the heart and the brain but they can occur everywhere in the body\nDr Tom ... says PHD most often occurs in the legs as a blockage it get worse patients have difficulty walking and experienced pain\nSo what happens is I got plenty of blood flow getting their rest but not enough to let them perform\nWell painful PHD is treatable and ... says one of the best things you can do is exercise through your pain to stimulate the body for more information talk to your doctor or visit Mayo Clinic dot org\nHave your veil Nashville\nStudio where dogs I mean I [noise]\nThe Knicks Arizona was number one actually and we had Sacramento, California was to uh there are some parts of California that is still getting people Sacramento's one San Diego's another one\nThat the others are what about Atlanta Georgia Dallas texas and Miami, Florida we are number ten on the list\nBut I feel like sometimes this information can get very confusing because we're saying yes people are migrating to Nashville\nBut then my next thing to consumers when they call to price their home are putting their home on their market is they think they can overpriced their home and they think that because they're hearing the rats that were saying and I do feel like it's confusing\nTo the consumers into the public there is a disruption in the market and the disruption is you know yes there are hot up\nSections of the market right those are the two hundred three hundred thousand absolutely that we do not have enough and then tore in that range of people that are moving here may be empty nesters and I'd be retiring or they may be young millennials you know going getting into this\nJob market here in Nashville so I think it is confusing especially to the consumer that is indeed a luxury home housing in let's say luxury home it it varies in different areas but let's say seven hundred thousand or more does\nHomes I see sitting on the market if they are not price correctly and we're seeing then not price correctly because the consumers have really a false impression of what's going on here locally in Nashville\nThe feedback that I've gotten Curie is that two years ago when that seven hundred thousand dollar home was priced it five fifty\nThere was still enough reason for somebody coming from California you say well that's that's what I'm willing to pay but now we've kind of adjusted that price up to seven hundred seven fifty and people are from California or New York or San that's kinda I might just be better off just renting or different price point\nYes and that is what we're facing especially end a luxury market are people they are considering is it a greater value they don't have to put as much down to rent\nVersus to purchase and ... now are we selling homes into lecturing market absolutely my biggest key advice do you have to price it correctly I\nHad a call just this week\nThe they had purchased a home\nAnd only about three years ago at a hundred and fifty a square foot which you know it was great price but they want to sell it over two hundred square foot and I'm like it ... it of course it has not\nInflated that much in two to three years you know can you get more yes but I'm Still seeing a condo that you know they purchased it at\nTwo hundred thousand ended up selling it at two o five and get for two years\nSo it's not you we still have to look you know the greatest thing when you're pricing it still goes down to comparable we do look at what you put into the home we look at your upgrade they do matter but the comparable matter\nI greatly and it it it does amaze me the amount of consumers that I sit down with and talk to on the phone or even\nPerson to person and have consultations that they just do not believe the comparable to try and you know they does matter at the appraised value of your home does matter but I wanted you know I Know it's confusing when we talk about yes we are living in a fabulous town Nashville is definitely\nOn a ... city and said it city but at the same time we have to be realistic when especially when we're putting those prices are out there\nYeah we've got a family and we got several families that are coming here from California that were in process on now that we're working for ... in California they're working for the state of the city government and the amount of income that they're getting in retirement\nIs not enough to purchase a home where they've been working\nAnd so they're coming here in fact I've asked several of these families why Nashville\nUm they don't have family here right and they're telling me well we worked thirty five years in the city of you know orange whatever county they're coming from and this is our retirement but we cannot afford to live where we worked for this retirement therefore we have to move\nWell and for so long I I Would love to get a California client or in New England client because they're going to think it's five hundred thousand dollar home is fabulous and ... and really you know not expense right and then because of where that and then maybe they were moving out of the million dollar same square footage right [noise]\nSo we're going to take a quick break when we come back we're going to continue

inland call and I'm very dire owner and CEO of ...\nIn Studio with me is ... ... s WB the mortgage and here we\nAre October October fast which October is one of my favorite my ... year ah because well so many things one is\nI usually loved the fall weather but [laughter] I feel like it's so hot which you know what I'm not even getting complain because here we go we're going to be in January and it can be icy outside in miserable and we're going to say we\nWant to have her when we were ... eighty five degree so but it certainly doesn't really feel like pumpkin weather but I Am so happy it's here a great sporting ... got all the sports going on and we are we next\nLeader certainly happy that hockey is back may ... a an action we are the proud exclusive real estate company of the Nashville Predators\nAnd certainly they do an amazing job and you know very excited that hockey is kicked off at\n... but you know with October we're sitting here which October is my favorite month but then it goes into November December January so the number one question that I get from consumers is is this a good time to lift your home\nAt I mean my phone blows up my tags blow up on that one question and it amazes me because yes\nI feel like it is and I'm not just saying that now is it as hot as the market and I still say the best time to lift your house ever is in March and catch the march April May our hands down the best\nBut actually October November December are really some of my second and it ties with summer months because some\nCan be good and it can be bad it just depends because if if you get a rash and a lot of people try to buy and really you you think of like by Labor Day or they buy you know they want to buy before Thanksgiving or they want to buy\nThrough spring break I mean there's usually a reason in cycles\nSummer months are good but some are much you can get really busy with a lot of ... because a lot of people are thinking it's summertime do we buy a house maybe I Want to maybe I don't want to you have a lot of people traveling to the city and they want to go look at home so I think you have a lot of ... at the same time in the summer\nFall you have more of if they are taking the time to go through this process you have more serious buyers which are like and a lot of them want to have it purchased by Christmas so my question my answer is yes October is a fabulous time to lift your home\nAnd to try to get it under contract and sold within Ninety Days depending on your price range sometimes thirty days but definitely before the Christmas\nOn or I think when you started you know ... somebody comes in it's so accurate you've got a price it right in this market in the end when it doesn't sell well you're generally cause you priced wrong and I and and listening to somebody like carry give you insight on what\nOr the market should sit rather than your emotional ... thinking of what you feel that I should\nI get a lot as they feel like it was only a certain price and and but she always sympathize with the cellar and I get it because this is this is your asset you want\nYou know to make a profit most want to profit on their home you know unless you have a job that you're going somewhere else and maybe your company's picking up you know maybe a relocation and you just went out and\nYou know there's many different circumstances the overall yes people want to profit when they sell their home it just it again goes back to really what it how it's staged\nWhat you have put an end to it when you purchase said how long you've had it there's so many factors that go when when you're pricing your home but as one theme of this show today is pricing correctly is vital when you're selling your home it means how\nLong you're on the market it means that perception as days on market when you know other researchers are looking at it\nAnd so again very important definitely if you would like a free a CNA on your home be sure to text me and we will send you a free CNA and give you a cost analysis of what your home is worth\nAll right So Greg we've got a lot of people looking to purchase a home and the next two years especially when we're talking about the millennials\nIt looks like the the the ... a recent survey said that thirty seven percent of adults and fifty two percent of millennials are looking to purchase home in the next two years\nSo with that they need a mortgage and that this survey absolutely blows my mind because according to a two thirds sixty five percent of homeowners didn't shop around for a mortgage despite right\nMost likely being the biggest purchase of their life on now why that doesn't even make sense to me I thought everybody\nShot for more you\nI Wish they would just call me and not job [laughter] but when you call Greg running to shop right [laughter] but you know but I actually encourage my borrows do shop that 'cause I I Want\nThem to feel like if they've made a good choice and they've made an informed decision but um you know we're dealing with buyers today that are um [noise] the sale cycle is so different\nThey're sitting around and they see something and they say should we buy\nAnd then they click something and then all of a sudden they're looked into a void you know where they just go into all these little things where people are just you know bond for their business\nUm and their cells cycles more like Ninety Days where as a ... for a mortgage loan officer typically it was more like forty dollars so we'd get a call from somebody we'd have about forty hours to get a pre approval investment out to him now it's like we're going to be bonded and the next two to three months\nRight and so it's a very different feel um but you know what I Would encourage you to do if you're out there buying a home is to to talk to some people and and you know\nOut her so let's say that my right was four point six to five\nRates are higher now by the way I'm just making up um and then let's say that you got to write a four and a half and you went with another competitor and then at closing that you noticed that um they've got an additional fee of two thousand dollars um called discount\nAnd let's say that your savings was only seven dollars a month\nWell it's going to take a long time to recoup that two thousand dollars so if you'd gone with me you have two thousand dollars more in your pocket\nUm seven dollars more expensive but if you're going to be in a home for less than what ten years well it's probably better take my ideal but their deal was geared towards your psychology of just grab the lowest interest right well and\nThat to me it's very confusing to someone that's not in our industry every day\nWhen we start throwing around the terms discounts prepaid ... you know the day those are hard charms everyone understands rate are for the most part you think the lowest rates you get then to lower your monthly mortgage I rise actually so a great way to explain it drag on how\nFor the consumer if they wanted\nHow can they ask for so let's say you were at four point five and then one was that four point to and they took back alright what are some of the key times that they need to lower our asked for to truly see what their ... yeah I guess would\nBe so the government has created a many years ago when a PR an annual ...\nSo you've got a note rate and an a PR rape no right is what your payments going to be is that's worth screen based on your a PR is suppose it is supposed to\nIlluminate the fact that there are additional costs so it was like let's say that that that they're a PR is five percent well you know there's something funny going on if they're a PR is a lot higher ... hate interests\nSo a brief factors in searches for the the president value which increases the interest rate\nSo if it's got to hire a PR\nThen there's something going on there just to kind of say oh we need to look and see exactly why that NPR so high because something's hidden exact I mean it's not necessarily hidden but if you didn't know then you don't ... about that India right\nExactly right great way to explain that the other part at fifty eight percent of consumers think an adjustable rate mortgage which we refer to as an arms are for risk ... they they've heard that yes everyone thinks that arm as soon as you say in Iowa it's a no right so\nThey got a bad rap and I'll tell you that right now there's what's called an inverted yield curve going on and that means that there's\nNot a lot of benefit for an arms they use usually I'm In a in a non\nInverted you'll market you are going to see a lot of spread you'll see a big spread between the thirty year fix an adjustable rate mortgage right now very little but soon they're back they're coming back and they might be a great solution for you because\nWhat was so popular back in the late nineties um so that the thirty year fixed interest rate over my career curious I'm six point in Thirty years that that's the average of the interest rate or my career so let's say the interest rates go to seven and a half on a thirty year fix\nWhich they probably will at some point um at seven and a half percent then let's say that I've got a seven one arm and the interest rate on that\nNow five and a half while you're purchasing power and your ability to buy\nA home it's a little bit more expensive and you're young and you're incomes are growing and if you don't even plant will stay in the house for seven years will yeah hate the seven one arm it works much better for your goals is doing but it's a very unique now would I say that to somebody on a fixed income that's going to hopefully stay in a house for the next Fifteen Years no well\nAnd that's why I Do think it's very important when we were talking about having someone and I know our world is I like to tax too sometimes I don't want to pick up the phone although I Do all the time but you know ... that's the world we live in where I'm going\nWhen you are getting a mortgage it will help you tremendously to talk to them first and as such as Greg Ryan\nSaid these are these are the goal is that my family this is why I'm doing I Know I Am only going to be in this home for three years and then we are going to you know upgrade downgrade whatever but then grad will know those products to put you and it's much different than this is our dream home\nWe want this forever we want to get it paid off those are two different products to different conversation so I Do think it's very important especially with you just go to a computer and you're entering into something just to get\nA pre approval which goes to my next question\nPre approval versus pre qualified yeah now we were talking about how our world is changing rapidly especially in our industry how are these changing how quickly can you do these how much are they worse now\nSo in today's world I'm a pre qualification as me just listening to you and then me thinking okay if you make that much money yeah and I think yeah go buy it um it but it's not something that a seller of a home needs to to use\nIt's something that I Am talking to you were talking about about how much should you budget for that's what we're talking about but for for ... a seller needs to do that I\nHave pre approve this person so I pulled her credit and our father income um I'll look to see doesn't pay stubs they are making what they say and I cannot tell you how many times so I've got one friday that they wanted me to get approval on and by doing this as long as a half\nI knew that even though they told me that they made Seventy five thousand a year I knew that that's probably not likely they were self employed and I knew what type of industry there there was self employed in and they have a tendency to give me the gross income right sure enough I'm a ... this weekend and they're like twenty five\n... not far off a pre approval enough I'd fire that off on friday in a cellar had gone ahead and and then taking their home off the market they might have missed out on another contracted so I did not give the pre approval letter because just off my experience knowing not to do that\nRight and we do you know and from a realtor standpoint I Do like to know\nWho not only do you have a pre approval but where did you get it from right because if it was somebody just throughout the United states computer generated by you entering in your numbers\nThat makes me nervous if it has been verified in my world as a realtor then I Know it's a pre approval and you know if you listen to my show any you know there's no need to even began your home storage\nIndefinitely search on line but did truly go out and just start viewing homes you certainly need a pre approval so that you know you know and really and the we say in the old days ten years plus they go\nAnd we were selling homes and people would have really ... it was more of a\nFree qualification and you know that the consumer would have had their heartbroken because at the end they still cannot purchased the home so get does the approvals make sure they are pre approved and if you've got any question\nFeel free to give us a call thank you for coming in today have a wonderful Sunday you will see you next week and\nOkay Leon soccer practice it for my I have ten sex Katie

you and love to see\nHow we can walk this trail with you well let's talk about what about the timing of that whole thing 'cause you know what we're now in October\nAnd we are a few weeks away from what we would uh having rain and I said extended\nAmerican celebration culture\nYou know we're going to have a a Halloween at the end of October and a lot of people just think hey it's just Thanksgiving and Christmas when they sometimes think holiday when you think about the celebrations that people are having\nIt begins with at the end of October with Halloween\nWere into Thanksgiving were then into holiday office party we got Christmas we got New Year's eve we got New Year's day we got the super bowl we've got a you know we end up maybe get a little break after Valentine's Day in February but you're thinking October through February we got a lot of stuff hitting us and so sometimes people get in that\nIn that ... in that in mind that mental thing that you know what hey we're getting ready to hit the holidays you know I I might as well just kind of wait till maybe started a new here well we'll talk about tiny talking you know well what would you say a person who's who's who's who's thinking that way and they think about that year after year\nThis great this is a great point that you make because most people will put off their health or you know just because there's some event coming up or some celebration coming up or not but I let me just share this with you there's always going to be a Christmas there's always going to be a Halloween there's always going to be a Thanksgiving\nIs always going to be an anniversary there's always going to be a birthday party listen if you if you guys think that I'm Out there eating seeds and grass and and hey every day to try to stay healthy that's not the truth of the my kids have a birthday party I have a piece of birthday cake with them if my kids how to celebrate and my wife and I go on the anniversary dinner if we're going to have a nice meal\nBut we know how to do it the right way and were healthy now so that our bodies can process to metabolize the food the right way and we don't have to worry about sabotaging ourselves and and just just a waking up they don't like we're in a coma situation so well again one of the things I always want to encourage ... or encourage you to think about is don't wait on your health\nThere's always an excuse that you can have to put something in front of your health and most people don't even consider are way the cost of what it is until something catastrophic happens and I'm telling you right now you don't have to wait to do that\nNow you don't 'cause really the time is now and one thing all the three sixty teaches each one of our clients is just how to navigate through those that are because I've read a couple of studies one study is that uh\nIt's very likely very common a person could gain eight to ten pounds during this time of year alone or in another study I read is or if they do only gain one to two pounds a year and it's one of the two pounds it never leave\nAnd if you're talking to one to two pounds every year that never leave sooner or later that's going to catch up with you so uh it's called the gift that keeps on giving [laughter] so that time has definitely now and it's just you know no don't ever think that uh as you as you're talking about your house\nThat or you just you know you're always kind of put you know that's really some of the things that we're hearing here from our own clients that came in and said one thing they say all the time as well I Wish I Would have done this in her\n... and again there's never there's never too late until it's too late so act on yourself right now be your best to be your best coach be your best to evaluate her and make the decision to do something you know we always talk about there's plenty of options out there\nWe ... we provide a unique option because we provide the structure accountability and the coaching\nA and we also provide something that's invaluable to most people and that's a community and if you have all four of those ingredients are much more likely to be successful long term and again oh wait wait studies all weight loss that he's all helping a lot of studies that I've ever read\nIncorporate the the these four things structure accountability coaching and community and if you don't have that\nThen most of the time what you're going to do is when life gets tougher you get out of routine get out of habit you'll go back to the old comfort foods the old covered habits the old they'll the old used to I should say and then when you do that many times you become disappointed because you find yourself in a situation where you were before you started\nSo come get one of our free seminars we got an in Brentwood we got in Murfreesboro economy men bill good luck to fill a you know we got 'em all over the hill Tennessee and if that didn't work for you will get you in for an individual consul at six one five three one two eight to four four give us a call and speaking of clients so we've got special guests tonight or I'll let you introduce him coach\nCoach I'm so excited about this because this is not only one of our clients but we had a new partnership with northwestern mutual and again I'm gonna let him all that Greg Greg burners are transforming the week and I'm gonna let him share a little bit about his experience with us but\nWe have a news sponsor coach for our show or a team of of just incredible people a credible teammates\nAnd I cannot be more excited about this opportunity for this new partnership with northwest are normal that Greg talked talk a little bit about that but before that let me bring him to the microphone so everybody can meet Greg Brenner So Greg Brenner welcome to the ... three sixty coaches they'll show I appreciated coach Scott\nTalk to us now let's go back to the beginning you you've been with us now do you you and I have a several things in common uh but the most important thing that we have in common is that we both have six children that is accurate and so you know that children can be a very challenging but also the ultimate blessing in life\nIs to pass onto the next generation so that you're not a generational thief\nOr the time that you spend with your children and grandchildren and so it was one of my great motivators to get healthy when the day when my wife told me that some of the man was going to walk my daughter's down the aisle when I thought I was having a heart attack in my backyard\nOr but talk to us a little bit about how you heard about is the first time you met us when you came to a seminar that take us back to those early stages what was your what was your why\nAm I why I'm was basically a posting thing that you experience my father a biological dad died at fifty four years old of a heart attack at no previous symptoms hundred and Seventy five pounds great shape ... been in the military and I'm with fishing one morning came home went to bed and never will back up\nAnd you know six children like you I'm kind of same thing on my I've got that uh cholesterol gene that's been in my family for a long time and\nAt that point I was really thinking you know I Want to be there for my younger children more calm down the aisle my daughter's either when they graduate ... grandchildren and great grandchildren and if I did not address these familial issues of cholesterol and that bad\nA heart gene then uh that wasn't going to happen and so I've I've known him for a while back when you were coaching CPA when our kids were there and I'm really saw your passion for coaching and then my wife house and actually said hey\nTo chose fault is doing a I'm kind of a health and wellness type program now Greg you ought to go check it out will bend see what he's doing and so I went to the seminar Alison came with me\nAnd her story and the passion and like you said earlier you didn't need to close me on it you didn't twisted my arm I thought this was the day that God put me in front of you in this program because I needed it\nAnd um it's really ... will join a that evening and it's been phenomenal ever since I had a little step back with a back surgery from a from a injury in the military so up in one of the coaches kind of ... back after me a little bit and so I'm kind of back on the program and good and feeling better\nSo let's talk about that let's talk about some of those intangibles some of the things that you were seeking and some of the things that you you won't in for your own life and how L. T. three sixty has been able to provide some of that as at least a game plan for you to get there\n[noise] yeah well one is you know even in financial services we teach the same thing of accountability in habit and structure and community and have a personal financial coach and uh so that was the first thing I was looking for is\nYou know we're living in a society now where knowledge is not the issue always it's the discipline and um the perseverance kind of a achieve things and so I Love the personal coaching that I've received for your um you know kind of keeps me on track but more importantly\nCoach Scott I'm wanting to be a better father about her husband or I Would like to probably a lot of men out there right now they're working you know working their tails off providing for their families I got home for thirty five six o'clock at night I was dead\nAnd I love coach and my kids in sports and I started finding excuses not to do that because I have absolutely no energy and um you know my my relationship with the house and my wife was paying a price my children were paying the price and so the intention\nThat I recognize very quickly\nWas the energy level to have a sustainable day\nAnd give all myself at work at home with Allison spiritually professionally and that was the biggest thing I've noticed in relatively quickly we were really within a few months uh I just really noticed that spike in energy and that just that I'm coughing\nAnd you know we're talking about a few a few months ago just that's this is a few months for the new year so that's a great opportunity to get in here and let's get you to the real you before the new\nYear ... [noise] yeah no question so again you can call that number six one five three one two eight to four for that six one five three one two to four for business\nIt is so much easier to say yes and just say no to things\n'cause once you understand your yes as in your nose you base that off the truth of your structure not just guesswork\nAnd again that's where money comes into play too is that you just don't you don't want to just guess\nAt what you're doing with your finances you need a budget just like we talked about having a budget for your food and having a budget for your energy and having a budget for your time and had a budget for your testimony your talents and your treasures\nYou ... you need to eat in a budget for your money and you also need to know how that money is going to work for you how it's going to serve you because money is money in of itself doesn't have any power\nIt's the exchange of money is how you use the money as a tool that allows you to leverage your life absolutely so if I was if someone was to ask you about that how would you weigh in on that was somebody of in terms of their health and they're managing money how does this relate to together\nYeah absolutely I think the first premise that we address with clients is kinda the same thing to do is you know well what do you have to invested yourself first\nAnd so what we do at Northwestern mutual kind of paint a picture of two different clients riders to classic come see me a client comes in there making a certain amount of income for them and their family\nAnd the first thing that they do chronologically as they go spin they got all the bills to pay that got the debt to pay and then whatever's leftover they save the gift they invest and they protected somewhere\nAnd then a lot of things I hear from those people are um well one they always play the shell game with credit cards they've got the zero percent they always know the richest right they know the minimum payment on credit cards and they play that shell game\nAnd then a number two I hear from them is I come from Monday of families wealthy ... Sunday receive that inheritance\nWhich ironically rarely actually happens because people will outlive their money their parents end up spending it and then third is um for some reason they feel like Thomas on their side and when they make more money things will get better and all that does is make the spinning box will\nClimate bill and the other hand they make the same amount of money same salaries some of them even lower\nBut with the elect to do first is invested themselves so they save the gift\nThey invest in the ... and they um [noise] I'm protected and then what's leftover they spend it\nAnd so those people are what we call owners O W N E R S they own their future they own their health their more confident um the a client that I describe as what we call the ...\nThey're always going to be always something their whole life and so if you think about is Scott health is no different\nIf you don't invest into yourself first and you come home from work like I did for ten years after I got out of the military and I did all my work I played with the kids and then at the end of the day at eight nine o'clock if there was any time left over I guess what I did\nI might work out a little bit I might go run for thirty minutes and so now through the mail to ... three sixty program just like I Do with money is I invest in muscle first so I get up at the beginning of the day that's what I'm doing my exercises a block that time and I don't do anything else until that happens so once I start investing and myself\nAnd made that parallel to when I'm coaching clashed with their money it's a win win proposition\nWell ... I think he's a great point because again we've talked this for years now coach if you don't invest in yourself nobody else will\nYou you you or your own greatest investment\nAnd so if you don't invest in you nobody else is going to do that so this is resonating with you\nA pick up the phone right now now what's going to happen this this this is a weekend show so what's going to happen is you know we're not going to be there right now but you'll pick up the phone either dial it'll it'll roll it over to a voice mail you'll leave a message or you can go online\nAnd one of ... and put your information in we're not going to harass you but we'll call you back and you can talk to us personally either me or my assistant we'll call you back personally and we will figure this out and we'll get you on the schedule or we'll just talk to you over the phone and figure out what your needs are and figure out when the next time we can meet or if you're interested in coming in for a seminar\nAnd so right now if you're if you're listening out there you know you're not living you're best life you know you you don't have your health the way you want it you know that there is some missing pieces and there's some dots that haven't been connected yet\nDo not wait I'm urging you do not wait we have over five thousand clients in the middle Tennessee area five thousand that's not because we just woke up one day and had some type of gimmick we've got a systematic approach to help you are but again we can't help you if we don't know you and if we don't know what your needs are\nSo pick that phone up call right now or go online and LT three sixty dot com and register in one of us will call you back\nA first thing a Monday morning or sometime during Monday we'll call you back and get you on the schedule or talk to you about your neat\nBecause one of the things we to deal with all the time is the connection between health and money is and you talk about what they're going to invest in a again people are always buying something but uh sometimes the stumbling block he got me want to talk on this um sometimes the stumbling block is do I want to spend this amount of money on my health\nUm and and and just again always trying to remind them that you know without your house you're going to limit yourself with your health you know even your ability to make money will increase\nComes from and give you a couple of examples here of dismay free somebody right now uh last summer a couple of summers ago my air conditioning unit went out in my house okay uh it was going to be five thousand dollars to replace that unit it was six\nKids in in the heat of the summer how quick do you think I made that decision do you think that you think I had to pray about that you think it had to talk to somebody about that is is a good investment for my family to spend five thousand dollars I've heard the story my wife transmission if if our transmission and by the way a few years ago are probably about five years ago now we had a Ford Expedition\nOr know shout out to Ford Expedition that I'm just saying we had a Ford Expedition\nAh and if you got one that's great if you don't\nThat's fine too uh but her transmission went out on a car thirty five hundred dollars how quickly do you think I made that decision\nI've heard of people painting the trim on their house for three thousand dollars for four painting the trim on their house and or unwilling and by the way our program doesn't cost anywhere near what what I just told you and what I just shared with you in terms of individual ... individual a health coaching program but\nWill pay thousands of dollars on you own things but they won't even consider spending a little bit of money each month or a little bit of money on themselves and when it comes to their health which is a sad state in our culture right now and it gets\nFocused on cost as well because the you know ... and he really can't get context unless you come to a seminar that's when you get the best context asking about cost immediately just kind of programmed you to think one way or the other when you got to understand the whole values that you're going to get\nTheir church or a somebody asked me the other day how much the membership fee was how much are paid when I started and I looked at him I said you know what I Can't remember\nBecause it was an investment and I feel so good about the results in my energy being up I Can't remember what it cost so I had to send them to your website\nWell my mother would need to charge you know Charles ... was paid for [laughter]\nSo yeah so ... it's just those kinds of things I feel just come and or at least check us out is not going to cost you anything to just listen uh and you'll never know how how many how many times we just hear all the time of just a great benefit and great die 'cause when you have your health\nYou really do have have have just so much value there\nUm and like I say if you think about any goal that you have either presently or in the future or you will you will always understand and know\nThat the health will just to increase um your opportunity and will not limit you so give us a call at six one five three one to take to for for ... on the Web sites\nAnd we're gonna come back for a next they went with a Great Britain renter the
