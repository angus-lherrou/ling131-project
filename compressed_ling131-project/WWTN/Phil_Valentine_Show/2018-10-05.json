{"month": "10", "state": "TN", "station": "WWTN", "content": "Husbands and fathers despite the turbulent bitter fight surrounding his nomination my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh\nWill work to less than the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer five four decisions and so that the public confidence in our judiciary and our highest court\nIs restart Mr President I Will vote chicken from judge Kavanaugh and\nThat is in Collins out in front of the Senate a full Senate floor boy oh boy did I was using calling one Susan Collins was before\nI used to really do now when I Walk him on in a Brian Wilson and Brian I got a toast Nashville's morning news she went to a judicial\nShe went far less emotional and very very reasoned a thought here and making the case for judge Kavanaugh I not real surprising after all of that I'm speaking for what forty minutes or so that was incredible\nThat was among the best creatures I have ever heard on the floor of the United States Senate and I've heard a lot of great speeches\nThat was something that was really sad and ... really I mean I'm a motion with about it I mean she hit every note trust right and and what I'm really sad about is globally that will be reduced to a twenty five second soundbite on the evening news\nI Hope it everybody who feels like this was a bad decision will take a moment to listen to that speech in its entirety she absolutely nailed it\nEither I I've always been sort of you know lukewarm about Susan Collins as a politician yeah\nMy esteem for her ... knows no bounds\nThat was an adult\nWho took the time to cut through the history or\nTo study the matter closely to look at what the law requires a senator in this matter to look at the facts in the case\nWith compassion on one side but also a sense that we that we can condemn this man if we don't have the facts to do it right and at the end of the day\nI think she made the right decision and I I Can't begin to express view I don't even have the words of my vocabulary to express few how impressed I was with us for\nIt almost felt like Brian is as I was listening to all of that it really sounded like she was sort of risk setting a resetting the discussion\nRight so she she talked about the accusations but she also spent a great deal of time talking about his decision to talking about the things that he is literally done\nOn the bench and she also admonished the Democrats in the way that they've got about all of this but it just I think what I said before um but you just said is is absolutely correct ... she went judicial reason thought not necessarily the most\nAnd when she came with a really an adult conversation regarding why it is\nThat she was agreeing with a lot of other Republicans in saying that they will vote to confirm\nBrett Kavanaugh I almost feel also like this is this was a message not only for the president but also for maybe other Republicans who may have felt like they were on the fence maybe that was a message to Jeff Flake maybe that was also a message to some Democrats as well\n[noise] well uh looked away it said right now we should not lose sight of what this means\nA Jeff Flake has said that he will vote to confirm the nominee unless something happens that is we don't foresee right\nWe now have a a Susan Collins coming on board and saying that are indeed he will she was she will support the nomination yeah Joe Manchin is sounding pretty positive or just I'm seeing a breaking news alert now that mentioned says he will vote to confirm it's a done deal\nArea I was a done deal\nYes so uh it's he's and it's going to be is going to be a situation where it was not a strict party line vote if I were a Democrat\nSenator right now\nIf I was Chuck Schumer\nAnd if I was Dianne Feinstein if I were sort of the key player dude I was in a Cory Booker if I was a senator Geraldo\nI Would just go away quietly and say nothing that dying for her I mean the Susan Collins put them absolutely in their place than all of this and that they are wise but will simply\nSay we gave it our best shot live to fight another day and fold up to their their suitcase and go oh\nYeah absolutely

I'm going to withdraw no you stand and fight that's what you teach your daughters and your son's you're going to stand and fight when you wrongly accused but see this is what they want these people

mark my words\nUh where did I put that story I have a story and show prep yeah hold on a second because this guy is going to his daughter's wedding he's walking down the aisle and all that kind of

they may not named him or they could do this actually if it ends up being a ... I think we're going to get one or two more Democrats because there's some there's some close contest out there that can't afford that\nThey just can't afford the margin I mean I'm looking at some of these folks are in close races out there\nAnd uh you got in Missouri a Claire McCaskill she's probably going to vote and it may be the end of her and I hope it is she's probably going to vote against Kavanaugh which will be great we also have a dream and who have to have been a hobby high can't we already know she's tourist\nI Would think she is I mean her opponents up for like ten or twelve point so I don't know a way or the other one okay yeah now test there would be an interesting one in Montana or he's an incumbent Democrat\nOr last poll that I saw was a grab his poll and that was from a about a week ago that had test her up by four points that's close to a margin of error stuff so his test are going to vote for or against capital Montana's a fairly conservative state\nSo you could see a couple of more Democrats\nAre end up voting for capital but it'll be interesting to see now other things that are going to weather a lot of things going on with the surrounding this but there's

[laughter] the chest her I said with him majority of the time sweet yeah I mean I appreciated his help and um he didn't want anything in return but the worst thing I did one day I was walking out to go leave I saw\nA light on I thought oh well I'll tell you go to I don't know what I did I cut off the little this little computer\nNetwork that he had a server yeah he had people that were subscribers they but they were and next thing you know Hillary's going what's going on\nOver there [laughter] I Know people [laughter]\nHey man I Know you're trying to do the right thing but I just don't cut that lights we I was in ... in my whole network bath and I felt horrible and I thought that is really weird it's a small apartment and just and and there's just this bank ... I'm sure all these porn sites went away just in the poor guy [laughter]\n[laughter] oh okay\nWell there you go so I make Chester and Jeff may be related we've got to find that out because this is really bugging me well here's where we stand where you can call him I mean he is he in Florida is that where he went I think it yeah even in Sarasota and he blames okay\nHere's where we stand folks we got flake or yes again Murkowski as a no and then we've got Collins who is a yes and mentioned is that yes\nAnd so that puts this as far as my calculation somebody correct me if I'm wrong on my math here but if Murkowski is a Republican and she's no and Manchin is a Democrat and he's yes we're back to where we were were fifty one\nBut here's the here's the wildcard there's a senator\nDanes and I'd never even heard of before today I just have to say that well I think I have steam Danes but I don't know much about him\nAnyway Ajmi walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding and that'll be tomorrow but he's going to be back sentence currently on trying to take a procedural vote\nTo advance the nomination and they did that already this morning and then with the final confirmation vote possibly at five pm on Saturday will Danes told CNN Today\nThat GOP leaders may be forced to hold open the confirmation vote for Kavanaugh overnight\nAs a senator returns to Washington from his home state where his daughter's getting married I'd come back after the wedding he says it'll probably be early morning\nUh we're we're taking it a day at a time to see what happens the lay without another twist to what has been an excruciating confirmation process for capital so maybe they may hold it open till Sunday Morning\nBut they're going to have to have a what is it technically have to have him\nBut the point is if they don't have him it's fifty fifty and Mike Pence makes a tie breaking vote\nAnd I'm telling you the Republicans don't want to do that because then that's all we'll hear from now until eternity is out Kavanaugh was never confirmed by a majority\nEven though he would be the majority is Mike Pence Mike Pence is vice president serves as president of the Senate so he's got ... votes so yeah he just doesn't exercise it unless there's a tie but he\nIs constitutionally an officer of the Senate in ... votes\nBut that's not going to be good for the Democrat so but I here's what I'm suggesting to you\nI think Mitch McConnell is taking all this into into consideration and I think he has maybe one maybe two other Democrats aside from mansion who are going to vote for this thing who are they going to be\nI couldn't tell you I Hope it's not Claire McCaskill you folks in Missouri she needs to go down and if she votes against Kevin all this change she will if she votes for them is a change she survived and\nYou know she's just that much of a politician she may do this but then again she's also that much of a liberal that she doesn't want to hack offer base constituency so she sort of in a\nNo win situation and I mean\nI got to tell you this I went to uh the guys now movie and we had\nWe had a nix are seeing who is the um the right now you went and Nick on what few days ago talked about this thing we have back on on friday you and I were talking about this afterwards Nick is very unassuming this guy's been in all sorts of stuff\nThis guy was in fried green tomatoes he was in the fugitive he was a sheriff and the fugitive he was in cast away with Tom Hanks there was a buddy at FedEx when they were before he went off on [noise]\nUm he's been in a bunch of stuff he's on a justified which I've not seen that show but he's a big star on that you've been watching that I mean you got to justify the name of it\nAnd I haven't seen that I actually Simon ah there's a TV adoption of lethal weapon ball that's right that's what she has a fairly good and he was in it that you know I ... back to the day we had him off so here he is\nYou know he's telling us well I got a little partners but he's the director of the movie and I got a little part in the way he got a little part he is\nHe is Kermit God's nails defense attorney and he's the one arguing the case and a lot of this is a courtroom drama and by the way it's not roses not gory but it is something that will make you think on so many levels\nI thought it was fantastic and yeah I went in there and not knowing what to expect for one thing but again when it's an independent film you're always worried you know what's the acting that will be like dean king was grade or the ... the lady who escapes my\nMemory now is those ... who's the prosecutor she was fantastic I mean everybody in there and and Nick Searcy was fabulous so I mean everybody and they did a really good job but then there's no bus on that it's just\nIt's not an abortion movie and I think that's what people are you know if you're trying to get ... [noise] um it is it is a it's a murder\nInvestigation because what was happening was Kermit guys now this abortion is and and you see what I took away from was this the political correctness\nThat we're experiencing in this country for one thing Tom Ridge was the governor of the time had explicit orders at least somebody from his office not to inspect\nAbortion clinics\nAnd you can say well okay you know their reasoning was we don't want to do anything he was a river by Republican governor don't want to do anything that makes people think he's trying to stand in the way of a woman's right to choose yet they inspect nail salons and they have to be certified every year they hadn't inspected this place in Seventeen years\nWhile in Seventeen years\nWill you'll see I don't want to give out with this guy would if you've read the reports and all this is true story obviously\nThe guy killed a bunch and we're not talking about abortion king you know 'cause you know people for their pro life say well the killing babies\nIt was sort of abortion that someone you argue for another day these were full develop born babies that he was birthing and sniffing the back of their necks and killing them crying babies\nCrying babies\nAnd this had been going on for Seventeen years without inspection because of the political correctness of the atmosphere of going we don't want to upset anybody because you know the thing that we're trying to take away a woman's\nRight to choose but once you see this is just unbelievable now I'm going to tell you a couple of things that he told us after the movie\nThat I don't think gives away too much I just want you to look for it when you see the movie because I thought you know they really got some really good actors of this thing there is a ... a there was a picture taken a while they refer to his baby a as one of the babies that was born alive\nAnd one of the um the nurses working there when the ladies I'm losing she was actually nurse she took a lot of pictures of a lot of different things she decided that she wanted to take a picture of this baby\nAnd this baby was born alive and and Kermit guys know killed the baby so she took a picture of this baby a fully developed baby\n... della killed and they ended up using as evidence was one of the things that convicted on one of the council murder so I'm not telling you too much about it but obviously you know the guys in jail for the rest of his life because he committed murder this is just the way they got him\nWant a mixture she told me the director there's a scene in the air wherever they are showing the picture of baby a to the jury right and this is in the movie and\nSaid those folks are very good actors I mean they you know you you really did a good job so she says\nAccurate mortgage group wants to know that being frightened of goblins or goals makes a lot more sense than being scared of the home loan process no matter if you're a first\nTime homebuyer or wondering if that cash out revise right for you when we say we'll walk you through the loan process from start to close that includes being available to you on a nice weekend end spooky holidays too so why wait apply today at accurate empty gee dot com accurate mortgage group\nAnd division of Kobe El Al see is an equal housing lender and in the last number four six six for that the music city center\nIn Capital Management weather's here's your forewarn weather forecast\nNear record breaking heat once again today temperatures in the lower nineties lots of sunshine very muggy out there tonight partly cloudy and pleasant a low seventies too when the warm weather center a meteorologist staffing to Lauren ...\nIt's hard to be stuck in the car for an hour much less weeks at a time but sadly many families right here in our community called their hard phone wouldn't it be nice to help them find an apartment in that were fed or even a shower you can by giving to the salvation army ... every donations\nBy for good cause it's Salvation Army top listening give dot org now to health\nOn housing assistance initiative for our neighbors most in the salvation army dot listening give dot org\nRun like a girl is a nonpartisan hot cat it's a documentary on the on the number of women running for office in the twenty he mid term election\nWe made history\nTo hear what it's like to run like a girl in such a heated political climate last year we marched this year we run [noise]\nFrom Westwood One find us on apple ... gas or wherever you listen to your gas\nIn Westwood One podcast network ...

the day before the testimony from a Dr Ford\nBecause I'm thinking because you remember we have this story that ... had been punk by some money on for ... or something you remember\nA obviously leaving

of stuff on it about this what Nick thing and then he was really good public again and there was going to go forward and the suspicion was was doing that but they've been punk by somebody who know I told you you know you get these things with a room full of salt\nBut what I'm saying is the irony is is it Susan Collins in her impassioned speech on the Senate floor today\nEssentially said that it was a sweat Nick allegations that changed her mind to support judge Kavanaugh how ironic is that\nSo we give these people enough time and they do something stupid enough to where they actually don't get their way\nAnd if Susan Collins didn't go the way who knows what would happen I don't think they have the votes without Susan Collins we'll see now if they have more votes tomorrow or whenever they voted over the weekend it's probably going to be people belong on because they know what's going to pass any way\nI'm just telling you Susan Susan Collins was the lynchpin and the reason she's going to vote for Kavanaugh is because the Avon body shakes a accusations were just an accusation too far she thought it ... the whole process isn't that ironic\nAnd this guy wants to run for
