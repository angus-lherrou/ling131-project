documented in a Pennsylvania grand jury report corresponded Rosa Flora's\nFrom talking to ... be survivors they tell me that they did this is a huge development because this is something that they have been asking for they've been asking for the federal government to get involved for years\nSeveral Catholic dioceses in Pennsylvania had been told to hand over documents to the Justice Department two new studies show is like an auto accidents in states where smoking marijuana is legal correspondence ... explains how that could impact drivers in states with legal\nIt's a misdemeanor the first time it's a federally second in subsequent times these people some of them have come back\nMultiple times they've committed felonies were carting them off to jail we don't throw kids in jail with their families were their parents so what do you do with them we do exactly what we do is find somebody here who knows them relatable whatever we don't have a relatively put them in foster care until this these folks you can get out of jail\nAnd then once they've been process through jail we're going to send them back home with their kids but this is what we do with every body\nAnd then I Would try it out bank robbers I Would try it out white collar criminals anybody else who the police's rated and taking them off to jail what happens to the kid\nWill we find somebody is a relative or somebody to put and if we don't have a relative we don't have 'em go someplace we can say we put these kids then we put them in foster care so that they're taking care of that is what we do with everybody every child\nWhose parents are going off to jail we do this every time they haven't made that clear it's it's almost like we're only doing this to these folks across the border\nAnd that's just not the case it's unbelievable anyway again\nThe prosperity continues folks and jobless claims were mainly the fifth year low and some of these folks up they don't know what to make of this I made a speech to David the pickle hackers international Peter Piper picked a pack of pickle Packers\nI knew they probably heard that a thousand times ... too but it was funny because they got a call and I didn't tell them this is a true story it's just a few weeks ago I got a call from my agent\nAnd uh I was sitting there at lunch and uh he says or the pickle Packers international is having their convention in Nashville they want your speaker\nI said you're not gonna believe this I Am eating a pickle right now it was a true story of a sudden they're munching on a pickle at lunch and I told them this is the goal they loved it\nAnd so I'm I'm One of them I said this was meant to be but I basically you\nKnow I've been sort of running this by you folks this week when I was going to tell them not told them basically what I've told you\nI we talked to they want to hear about the uh the tax revolt they were fascinated with that what we did in Tennessee where the horn honking and all that so I you know I gave him an abridged version of a of that I was the final speaker for the week they had ship ah what's his name from Nashville that play beacon\nI think he was speaking to him yesterday they said he was fantastic and where we've never met him have we don't believe so but you know he's an improv guy so he's up there doing some songs and then these improv and while he's doing the songs and making stuff they said it was just very entertaining\nAnyway today I you know I Try to limit entertaining but I tell the story and uh it was funny because I started telling the story of course I'm all animated stuff and then people you know because they don't know who the heck I Am a lot of these folks and then people start coming in the back they go on what's going on in the [laughter]\nWe got some lunatic up there on the stage and he's just going off about it\nBut you know I think the whole story if you haven't heard that well by the way if\nI Would assume that the book tax revolt as is available on a on Kendall I don't know I mean I haven't I haven't circle back around with out in a long time but I Would assume this it's on cable it's probably pretty cheap but the hardcover is out there to there's no audio book we should do that but anyway\nIf you you you folks in Tennessee who probably lived this you folks outside of the Tennessee didn't live this but it's an amazing story of really boils down to have the most about five thousand folks who would show up in protest over an income tax and we did the horn honking and people would circle the [noise]\nThe capital capital bull their horns and it was me and several other talk show hosts that got out of the in sort of banded together you know let the rivalries fall by the way for the moment are so that we could do what we needed to do it is available and Kendall OK\nSo a tax revolt if you ever want to read this it centers on what we did in Tennessee but it also brings in\nThe you know a tax revolts throughout history and sort of ties them all together only two Ninety nine only two Ninety nine good grief by the book by the book Guinness tax revolt is the name of it while you're on ... I think you'll be inspired by it because what I told him I said look\nMost people have this going on oh I Can't make a difference oh it doesn't matter that is when it comes to ... time to vote audio and it does I'm telling you we had no more than five thousand people I think that was the top ... we had at any of these protests and most times it was several hundred folks\nThat were there that Changed History for this state\nSo I talk about you know another famous tax revolt you're of the Boston Tea party so how many of those guys were there\nTwelve maybe\nWhat kind of impact that have on the United states twelve people were one of us know feel actually it was twenty two whatever you know what I'm saying a handful of folks\nWho had the gumption to go there for a whole bunch of tea and the Harvard because they were upset about the taxing and the and the rest of it you you see what happens when a bunch of folks band together and do the right thing\nAnd so I was ... lead that into\nThis time that we're living and I said look because they told me before you know we got some Democrats have this or you know try not to upset them to I said look this is not\nThis is not a partisan issue whether you one of the tax cuts that we got from Trump or not we got him and this is what we've got we've got a roaring robust economy and instead of sitting around and denying it or not wanting it to be successful you need to be taking advantage of it because this is a unique\nTime in American history we may never see this again\nThis is unprecedented nuts and I'm not saying that we haven't had great times before and I'm not saying that times haven't been better at some point you know we we see unemployment at like a fifth year low that tells you that unemployment was lower you know some time prior to that I don't know but I Will tell you this\nBack in Nineteen sixty nine when the unemployment with Islam that we have Twitter Facebook the Internet ah apps Silicon Valley that we have any of this we had none of this\nYou folks who were in the record business you know this I mean we didn't you know we had ... you can go straight to the public talking about books you can publish your own book you can put it on Amazon and you can sell it\nIf you want to\nIf you have if you have the drive to do it\nMy point on all this is forget about who's taking credit for it we know who's taking credit for Donald Trump and engage justifiably so but don't let that keep you from taking advantage of one of the most unique times in history to be an entrepreneur\nEven you liberals that they should understand this this is a unique time don't say well wishes Trump and you know I don't forget about all that just get out there and do it\nIf you've got an idea and make it work again I caution you don't take your life savings and throw it into some ... idea you've got and then come back and blame me when it doesn't get off the ground I'm just saying\nThis is the time for ideas because people have now more disposable income and they've had a long time the economy's going like crazy the optimism we keep seeing these dads\nOptimism at an all time high optimism in the ... we had another story yesterday 'cause I mean it's a daily day lose your these types of surveys of how people are just so excited about what's going on I'm telling you it ain't gonna last forever\nIf not going to be Trump's fault probably is just a cyclical thing that happens in the economy\nWe don't stay in this boom mold forever at some point we bust now I Would suggest to you that some of that has to do with the fed but that's a whole different discussion the fact the matter is we're not changing that dynamic right now and you've got to understand you've got a window to operate in\nIf you've ever thought about being an entrepreneur and and getting something to market you've got more people now that have disposable income to buy it and more people that are optimistic about the economy they may be more receptive to your idea now's the time to do that that's all I'm saying and that's why I told them\nAnd uh you know I wanted to end on some no but at the I said look [noise] so I ended and I came back with a P.

reports Saudi Arabia murdered journalist to their embassy in Turkey\nYou're certainly that they would share their results with the Saudis as well um so we do believe that between these two efforts complete picture will emerge but what actually transpired here\nAnd apparently John Bolton was\nAccusing Kirstjen Nielsen I'm not doing your job and that's when a machine gun Kelly flu hot on them and then they got into it screaming at each other you know it is possible the Trump didn't know because ... was leaving your preparing to go to a Montana so he may have been upstairs and the residents pack or something you knows\nBut or whatever the deal is the parents have calmed down but it doesn't change the situation the situation is as it is we've got a caravan of these people coming across record number of illegal families crossing the border now\nAnd this is from a hands as Ellen the online record\nNumber of families crossing us borders Trump Britain's new correct about he's talking about sending to the military to the border\nNow when other presidents have done that they've sent in the military down there and they're sort of like ... bothers a they don't really do anything or they're handing out meals or whatever the water it's ridiculous I think when Trump talks about sending the military is to crack down\nOn the people coming across in other words set up a perimeter on the border and don't let these people across and that's exactly what he was ... it means he blows he doesn't want a wall then we'll just put the ...\nDown there on the border let them conduct their exercises nobody gets then it's an invasion if you're crossing the border we look at it as an invasion and and and and you will be treated accordingly as an invader we assume you're going to do us harm\n\nWhat else they say on this thing us border patrol agents arrested sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family members in September the highest one month total on record and an eighty percent increase from July according to unpublished homeland security statistics obtained by the Washington Post\nLarge groups of a hundred or more Central American parents and children\nHave been crossing the Rio Grande in the deserts of Arizona's turned themselves in an by citing a fear of return the families are typically assigned a court date and released from custody in the United

Central American migrants heading north\nHave left them in a period state White House aides say he's been receiving regular updates on the border numbers telling senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and chief of staff\nJohn machine gun Kelly that something has to change\nAids including Miller and Sarah Sanders have continually told the president that many of the children coming across the border of being smuggled illegally and that the United states is being taken advantage of\nThe president's willing anger has left him pushing once more for reinstatement of a family separation policy in some form which he believes is the only thing but his work despite the controversy it triggered\nOne senior official conceded that the separations were halted to stance the political theory but ended up sending a clear signal that people could cross adding now we're actually getting\nCrushed see here's the thing this is now a political calculation\nHere we are less than three weeks before the midterms if Trump then start separating families again he gives them this issue and then they say see what a cruel main person don't we got to have somebody to stop this we gotta have the Congress in ... in charge of the Democrats to stop all this stuff they can do it Trump won't do it\nI wouldn't give them that issue but on November seventh I'd start separating the families again and I put up a perimeter on the on the border heck has been going on now since July you may as well wait three more weeks and not let the Democrats that you're over the head with it\nI'm just saying there's a lot at stake folks or not we shouldn't do something about it and I was you know sending the military down there right now and trying to control the board of may not be a bad idea but you gotta be careful of the cars the news media folks are going to spend is their way no matter what you do\nThey're going to make you looked like the demeanor old conservative you know Republican president who's just trying to tear families in part you can't win with\nThis you know what we've got um we got seven million open jobs right now they say that an employment of the fifty year low what if Trump were to do this what if he were to set up job fairs on the border\nAnd these people come in and say hey how many you folks want to work\nI Know what you're saying well isn't as amnesty now it's what I'm saying is this is for show set up a big jobs for your tent\nAnd have these folks go through I mean it would be hilarious wouldn't look at what Trump's doing he's finding these people [laughter] why would the left's head would explode\nThis I can tell you we have seven million positions in this country we need failed and these people want to work with advice if you wanna work everybody wants to work okay and you set up a big job senior and you have it on top of the uh Trump's jobs fair\nRaw you know all emblazoned on the top of the tent so you can see it when the helicopter is doing an aerial shots and have Mitch McConnell be the spokesperson well we're we're going to vote now yo\nYo yo no work going work now our work where you're at work so\nYeah you're talking about a PR move oh my gosh Trump says we're going to take care of these folks now you know that's just going to be a magnet in the long run obviously you've got to have an orderly way for these people to come across that's the thing about it you know I told you this one of my kids [noise]\nThey have these heavy conversations every once in a while with his friends and they were sitting there and they were talking about the illegal immigration problem and all these people coming across\nAnd they've been going around and around you know these legal to streaming across with her and so one guy said okay All right I got an idea I got an idea how about we do this\nHow about when they come to the border\nWe process these folks Ryan and then we do a background check and we find that you know if they've got like terrorist ties like you're talking about or maybe MS Thirteen ties and then we we those folks out and then we just let the people who have legitimate skills and want to work in the United states we let them in and my son said\nThat's called the legal immigration\nAnd the guy went oh\nThat's what we're talking about doing citizen assumption out that well it's not even in the ... and it's become an assumption with a lot of folks who don't know it's become a talking point where the people who are trying to make it a talking point that people who are conservative and won a strong border don't want to let any of these people in\nAnd that is not the truth at all I'm not run into anybody who says close the border down completed only by across\nA reminds you two thirds of the people who come across that border come legally and there's not any there's not a my I Know uh my side of this complained about that all we're saying is get in line with the other two third and come through legally like they do just don't come across illegal because we don't know we are\nAll we're trying to do is wait out\nThe disease ridden the drug dealers mules the terrorists the MS Thirteen members the undesirable Z and let the folks with a legitimate business in this country come in like the two thirds who are already come and I don't think that's a point that's being\nShouted enough from our side I'd do it on a regular basis\nBut I mean Trump should be saying this two thirds of a sudden you see him with his index and his finger and his thumb to get two thirds two thirds of the people come across the border completely what's wrong with the rest of these folks why are they going to come across the border illegally if they come across legally we give them a job this I can tell me and so\nIf you have eight this is the whole point folks if you have a border wall than they are naturally funneled through the door is\nThey can't come any other way but legally they come through the door and they say hey I Want to come to America and work and we go oh aren't you the guy Hector so and so who's got the cat it up with MS Thirteen none of you my friend are going to stay on the other side of the world would you\nWon Rodrigues you've got the skills we need people like you in this country want you want to be an American you want to come over here start on the path ... yeah you come on in that's the way you do it it's a matter of a weeding out the undesirable but some of these people in the lab they want these people just stream across the border\nWith no thought of what they might do once they get here and then you end up as the family of Kate standing and thousands of other people in that same boat we're undesirable criminal illegal aliens come across and kill people\nAnd then you say well that's just the price it's not the price you can have both you can have great people who are coming from Honduras who are coming from Guatemala who are coming from Mexico who are coming from El Salvador without having the undesirable it's called the legal immigrant\nIt is very simple thing to do it as a matter of going through the process and getting yourself checked out background check and make

I was living in the United states for the past year and writing for the Washington Post by the way has been reported that he was a U.S citizen I don't think he was with us is only this guy was a U.S citizen here's the deal with all this\nAnd I know we've been over some of this before so bear with me there is strong evidence\nIs this guy is a was was if he's dead now what does this guy pops up alive somewhere where we're going to do oh my gosh when you got to\nGo hide\nThere's evidence that this guy was a spy for the Muslim Brotherhood the Muslim Brotherhood has been at odds with the Saudi crown prince you know the Saudi royal family\nBecause they want to take over and turn it into a theocracy right now it's a monarchy I don't know which one's worse I Would say the monarchy is the lesser of two evils to be quite honest with you\nOr I Know that's a fact I mean you get a theocracy the Muslim extremists they actually like Iran with the ayatollah and stuff that's bad news\nNow a monarchy is not the best thing in the world but they've been pretty well we don't know they're at their involvement in nine eleven and other things that are going on either who knows what's going on what I'm trying to tell you is this\nThe mainstream media folks are focused on this because this guy wrote opinion pieces for the Washington Post otherwise they wouldn't give two hoots about the guy if he was just a run of the mill garden variety Muslim Brotherhood do they wouldn't care but they don't want to point out that he's part of the Muslim Brotherhood or was\nBecause that would ruin the whole narrative because right now they got the black hats in the white hats and there ain't no grey hats and so they want this to be cut and dried this guy was a wonderful person and the Saudis are horrible people and they killed him that is not to excuse the Saudis for killing\nThem if they did it and have and how they did it although I don't know how you know from an audio tape how somebody's killed that's rather odd to me okay now I'm going to cut up with them and now I'm going to get over it I mean to are they giving the blow by blow on this any way they'll shore and all that out I don't know how they know\nBut what I'm trying to tell you is the Saudi Government has done and they do all sorts of horrendous things all the time we have historically turned a blind eye to them because we named Earl\nAnd I'm really getting sick and tired of us\nCompromising our morality for things like oil and money and trade and the rest of it\nAnd I and I speak specifically to shine the best thing that could possibly come out of all these tariffs with China is that we never deal with them again the best thing that could come of it is if people find other places in the world the source their

percent is made in\nChina shame that a brutal\nCommunist regime I've often said this and this is a great visual for you if you want to think about it if you were to have a mall\nAnd you were able to walk into a store in the mall and there was a glass wall behind the counter where you're buying this stuff\nAnd you could see who was actually making it and the conditions they were making it in you wouldn't buy one thing from China\nBut the sad part is that wall is not transparent\nYou don't get to see what's going on behind the wall and they do this on purpose if you did if you had any kind of conscience she would buy stuff at all costs from somewhere else yeah I'm One of those people that looks at labels I don't always get a chance to buy I mean sometimes you can avoid it\nBut if I if I have a choice of buying something that's made in China or something that's made somewhere else I Do my level best to buy it from somewhere else because I don't want to see\nThis communist ... rice and

two hundred bucks or less\nMore than three times the amount the Republicans campaigns are pulled and\nAct blue that's a fundraising platform for the Democratic candidates of course\nHas been key to

alone\nA and I I can almost guarantee you that act blue has something to do with George Soros everything has something to do with George Soros this guy is funding a lot for the Democrats\nSome of those who a mask the most were self funded meaning they gave a large amount of money to their own campaigns some of those happened to be two Democratic candidates for Senate\nWho have raised the most money so far this election are representative or ... or Rourke\nRaised a record setting sixty one point seven million in his quest to unseat Ted Cruz and Claire McCaskill in Missouri she raised twenty eight point six million the to geo piece Senate candidates who have a mass of the most money or governor Rick\nScott of Florida and a Bob Hugin is it hugging her husband of New Jersey who were both largely self funding their campaigns and then there's the house side\nThe candidates who've amassed a larger war chest so far a Democrat David thrown in Maryland six congressional district gave himself\nA most of the sixteen point five million the race so here's a guy who wants to be in Congress wants Congress pay now two hundred and something thousand dollars a year\nAnd he he's raised six

not in this thing because this guy's got a truck load of money I Can't imagine he hasn't given that to his own campaign they don't mention him in this\nBut I'm just telling you folks money doesn't always translate into a win but his show doesn't hurt\nYou remember ah I don't remember it was it was Michael Huffington your area and a Huffington was married to I think his mind he he's the guy that

did he not I'm not I'm not joking I think he may have decided he wanted to swing you know he was he wanted to swing the other way I don't know it seems like there's something in my mind we'll ... we'll see you now what is this supposed to be something wrong with it\nOK I that's just what I remember anyway\nWhat I remember about him this this is the figure that six in my mind and don't quote me on it I think he gave his campaign Seventeen million or something like that and that was for a Senate campaign in California and he lost he was a Republican by the way\nAnd she was a Republican and then I guess after that little break up she went clear across the purely they both did it was one eighty you know I don't [laughter]\nOf course are married to her or you know who knows they turn you

at it matter of fact ...
