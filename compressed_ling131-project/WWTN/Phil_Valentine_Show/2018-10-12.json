where we get started this is not we're not going to put abortion on trial that's the whole point the poor will feel what's the point of the movie\nThe point is that an abortion doctor because of political correctness and abortion doctor who's murdering people can hide behind being an abortion doctor and get away literally wouldn't murder of\nDozens of people dozens of people this is about a guy who burst babies and then killed them and I don't think anybody out there and the pro choice world except for a few of the extreme nut cases can say that's okay\nBut that's what they got the guy for now this is not a gruesome movie they don't show gruesome stuff uh they they that this is about the trial of ... guys now and how they nailed them on all this\nBut what is so scary is\nThey almost didn't get him\nAnd you'll see how they happened to [noise] they happened to bust him on something else that was totally unrelated to the murder charges and then when when they went to searches abortion clinic for evidence on what they were busting and force when they found all this\nAnd the question that's out there that they don't even ask this but it's a the obvious question how many other places around the country is this happening where because of political correctness nobody is keeping an eye on abortion clinics who knows how many other Kermit God's nails are out there\nI have no idea I have no idea but they say legal abortion is vilified by the pro life cause they'll movie which inadvertently shows\nDystopia of a post row America\nIt does is it an awful\nSays after four and a half years of fundraising filming and distribution guys Nell the trial of America's biggest serial killer has finally landed in a limited number of theatres the title of the conservative back drama does each one of the story of Dr Kermit guys know a Philadelphia physician physician\nNow serving three life sentences though is likely confusing for most true crime aficionados that's because in the film and in real life guys now was tried on eight charges of murder and convicted on three that's a large number to be sure\nBut a small fraction in comparison to say Gary Ridgway pleaded guilty to forty eight counts of murder John Wayne gain the convicted of thirty three murders Ted Bundy\nConfessed to twenty eight murders and was convicted of two and Jeffrey Dahmer confess to Seventeen murders and was convicted on Fifteen will feel what do you say about that because the people\nThis guy killed he disposed of them they could never prove who they were ... you could never prove all they got him on three and a manslaughter charge on the fourth\nBut that's all they can pin on them they knew there were dozens of them he had been doing this for years for years that was the whole point\nBut they want to act like all well this is this is just their vilify and legal abortion and this is what's happening on the frame the death of this movie\nCause for some reason they don't even want to go down the road of publicizing\nA a a serial killer if it happens to be an abortion is which is just weird to me if this guy were gynecologist if this guy were if this guy were a plastic

don't want to over so uh what we're expecting tonight at the box office on Saturday and on the weekend but I think it's going to be more than you think and uh I Know what's going to be more do you think of the Nashville area because we've got a lot of people that have you know the preview that so when\nYou have a preview like that in the end it's um it goes over so well those people become disciples and they go out which is the whole point of doing it they go out and spread the word and we had a packed house here in Nashville a real new Thursday which you go\nYeah we sure did it with a great audience and a great screening and\nYou know ... that's been the records that I've gotten early on today that the movie's doing very well I've gotten a lot of course I'll just go to all people just tweeting me and saying oh hell today in Indiana house today in Chicago that kind of thing so hopefully uh hopefully a lot of people are getting the word and making it\nYeah well it really is it's it's an emotional film obviously a but it's an impact fulfillment it's something you know what the really interesting thing about it is\nLot of people are going to see this movie and have never heard this story before but ... now which is just unbelievable isn't it\nYeah I mean at that point a hard subject for people to look at but part of the reason I wanted to do the movie was not so much even can make a political argument\nThe movie in such a way that we could share the information that most people don't have about what an abortion actually is how it's done\nAnd to share it in a way that can be palatable\nBecause it's just it's very hard look at but you know it's one of those things if you're going to have an opinion on this you need to know what we're talking about and that's what I Hope that movie does\nYeah and again it's not graphic ... there's nothing that you're going to be a little is grows is just not bad at all but it is it is about the arrest trial of karma guns now who hid behind being a a an abortion doctor to commit some of the most atrocious murders he was convicted of three\nA first degree murder charges but you know we know there were more a lot more and that's why the subtitle is um you know the trial of America's biggest serial killer\nSo it opens this weekend and uh and how many theaters the you know\nI Believe it's over six hundred something like six hundred and fifty theaters um and hopefully if we ever really good weekend it'll go to more theaters after that\nYeah that's normally what happens in yeah [noise] yeah\nSo if we are it's very important for everybody to go this weekend if you can and let's get those numbers up so that the movie can do well because I really do think it's an important movie and that people on both sides of the issue can benefit\nFrom it and make and they'll see you in and try to make a movie that uh I'm I'm Sorry\nI said no see you went in to I Want to emphasize that gives you a fantastic job with that thing I'm telling you\nWell thank you ... it was such a relief to act you know and while I was directing it that I sometimes I forget that I'm In it [laughter]\nYeah I was I was asking me you know when you're acting in that scene who says cut you know so it gets his line I'm Todd that government so I guess you have it yeah it is an director right\nYeah but sometimes I Would say that you know start over whatever right yeah I had a lot of great a director of photographer a director of photography\nNamed mark Peterson and I've worked together reports and really trust him so I could just go after him I think I'd go with that good and you go yeah like okay\nFine then cut or he did he say no I'm the director I say cut cut\nAnd you really they say that I did say caught on my own sane [laughter]\nWell you you folks have to see this because it is a marvelous are marvelously may movie and the message is just going to blow you away it's not it really is something you folks couldn't lenses abortion movie but it's it's ... I I've I've I'm\nTold people it's like a souped up version of law and order I mean it's just it is um it's an intriguing story about going after this guy and the evidence so if you like those kinds of things CSI law and order a nice guy except types of uh or if you like Grisham novels\nIt's sort of one of those things it's a you know a lot of it takes place in the courtroom\nAnd then what

yeah I mean to be seen as of land that job\nHere and the guy who plays guys now Earl Billings I mean he is remarkable it's a great performance really is\nI Know and he does he really does a good job I'm seeing that guy in some stuff too because he looked he looked quite familiar but he uh he's\nBeen yeah he's been around for years and years\nAnd he does an eerie job is gonna go there was one of those I mean I guess still this day this guy doesn't think he did anything wrong does he\nKnow that absolutely convinced that he was performing a service and that that what he was doing was no different than anyone else\nYou know I'm a think keeping victimized by the anti abortion crowd you know he doesn't he doesn't believe in that distinction between what he did and legal abortion\nYeah

I I I started using you're using the videos we bid for Europe you know there were fun travel videos\nWell what I did was travel videos is um\nI Would use the local music like would come across folks that were actually playing and then I Would use their music\nAnd I found some really killer music out there from folks that were really good and just playing on the screen and so I Would use that in and like I gave him credit too because you know there are they got websites and what have you\nWere ones that I was was that ... I think it was Prague I ... and I came across the guy there two guys actually and they were playing music\nAnd I think they were doing it was kind of funny because they were doing sitting on the dock

around the world telling everybody else how to run their countries and then you look at some of these dictatorships or kingdoms you know like Kuwait Saudi Arabian somebody the other when we go\nWell you know are the people upset about it\nBecause far be it from us to assume that everybody wants to live in a republic like we do so I can see both sides of this what will this not open our eyes to the fact that most of the hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis alone\nI don't know how that happens without the Saudi Government being involved in it\nAnd of course we've heard the stories about the Saudi royal family they some of them that we're here in the United states that were given safe passage by the Bush administration right after nine eleven and some right before it so I mean I don't want to hand of the conspiracy theories but\nSaudi Arabia has not been a good actor and they're also part of OPEC for crying out loud this jerk and are chain on the gas prices I don't know why we count town to these folks but apparently this may be the end of that if Trump as a thing to say about it so we'll see how it ends up\nBut it takes killing a Washington Post columnist\nSo we don't want to look into the fact that Saudi may have been the Saudis may have been behind nine eleven I'm not diminishing don't get me wrong I'm not diminishing the brutal murder of a columnist for the Washington Post but it seems rather self serving on the part of the media\nThat this is what gets them upset and not the fact that most of the hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis and there's good evidence of the Saudi Government knew about it but no you kill one of the journalist oh my gosh can be hell to pay again I'm not belittling\nThat I'm just saying you got a wave is all I think that the nine eleven hijackers being Saudis was a lot bigger story than a columnist from the Washington Post but this is going to be what severed ties between the United states and Saudi Arabia not the fact that they may have\nBeen involved in killing three thousand people on nine eleven I'm just saying QuickTime out one eight hundred six one eight fill one eight hundred six one eight seven four four or

more people in that business or a in in that are in that group because my wife is just talented but I don't know how to Al Gore's far as being an artist yeah or ... she is fabulous absolute right and she's the bad thing about it\nIs that ... and nothing against her dad but he has not not very supportive well no I ... and he's really kind of killed her\nHer confidence in that area man well she doesn't need to listen now as I told her and and so I'm hoping I can introduce or to the people that maybe ... does she do unless you'd like to paint or does she like do cheer all all of it she paints draw she does I Need to bring in\nThis a wood burning thing she did for her dad it's up to do an a and a ... a female dean yeah as a female there and and it's young going you know there are limits on

that explored it but I'm just saying you know she she's an Indian artists how really able would dig that they really would and she just she not only is any ... she looks Indian and she's found a\nBeer and I've never been around a more fun or she's a hoot she really she's country but that's why as you go to our country you know she's very [laughter] and you know and then from her part of it I\nYou know everybody in the south says y'all mhm but from her part of the country it's unions arguing you in person and I I I you know when she moved here I was like you may want to drop the U.S [laughter] and you and it makes you really ... well I got a friend who's um\nHe's married to an uh an Indian leaving and uh I mean she'll she'll break into doing all that stuff and she's from way out in\nThe sticks and the hurricane Mart first met her he or she said uh you watch they suffer and he says a shoe or she said we're having neck\nBona noodles [laughter] and I am ... said\nA I've never I don't believe I've ever had that and you're trying to be polite said should I ain't never known them but in the neck Mona noodles and so [laughter] and so mark Kay believe somebody never had that Boehner noodles so um\nYeah I mean that's some way out in the sticks up right there you know it is that your wife will get hooked up with somebody that can help her promote her stuff\nShe needed to cities that because that's what I told her I said you need to get out of their father tries to keep her and you know there'll be a greeter at Wal Mart or no no no no no no no this is an artist\nWhat she needs to do and this is my advice to where she needs to put some of this stuff just take pictures of it and get her ... page or something put it on the and see if somebody buys all she's got the she puts it on me and she and she ships it up\nVery lucky all the ... our music ground gosh I just love it because she she painted Hendricks really he's in there um she also painted this train at the like a rock and roll train on the other side that novel I write flip side of that and then uh she has the old way one\nAlbum cover that she painted well I'm On that because that will say she needs to be doing this and that album was out when I first moved here mhm to Nashville that's why I Am so special ... shot\nAnd then we'll promote it on the radio and people do it I'll put a link to it it filled

you know I have managed to swindle my way through this life on mediocre talent\nAnd ah [laughter] that's precisely why are your brother and and it's just if you know I have made it through on goal you know I have no shortage of goal\nAnd something else as I have no shortage of a I guess galling gumption are very similar but I don't mind failing and it doesn't faze me one bit when somebody says oh you suck you know go okay well I'll come back and show you so ah what I what I lack in talent I make up and and goal but\nShe's got talent and no goal right she needs to have some golf so she needs if she's not going to have goal and this is a problem with some artist out there they need some that's why you have those sleazy agents you know it's right [laughter]\nThat's where they come in because they don't care they'll pass through the hell out of everybody and they don't have any friends anyway so you know they just go out there and they just they they got money you know they have the money and they passed the heck out of everybody and get him to come you know to to the\nWeather is our show or whether it's a show show hey or whatever the case may be and they just make a dent in general nuisance of themselves but they uh they get the artist expose the naturally so that's their talent you know their talent is bugging the hell out of you\nAnd so you you need somebody like men deadline and then once you do what you made any ...\nAnd they will be the goal and then she'll run off with that guy ... knowing my history oh yeah [laughter] well yeah you didn't have an effect now\nOn the big stuff folks we got several cranes a left wing people out there that are attacking and they're mostly pro life I was a there are several stories you can check by the way the guy who kicked the pro life woman\nYou remember when we have that and then we showed the video that got all that just made my blood boil I wanted somebody to hold and I wanted to hold him down and beat the crap out of him he's been arrested and he struck by the way that wasn't the first time he's vandalized stuff and they've got him doing it on several occasions\nSo he may be going to jail for a while I Hope so uh but we also have this thing with the Turks saying that the Saudis killed this Washington Post columnist\nAnd I'm sitting there looking at a National Review story today the desert kingdom keeps turning the United states government and the lawyers they're talking about the ... mall cash Yogi a well known Saudi political activist and journalist last week he went into the Saudi conflict in ins is than bullets in Turkey\nTo get a document for an upcoming marriage and then he disappeared\nTurkish authorities are searching for the Saudi hit squad they believe murdered him and then dismembered him whatever my beret the is at work they say it's now becoming another special moments in the very special relationship to in the United states and Saudi Arabia\nWe can add it to the other special moments where the president ... golden ... were America's ... columnists praised Mohammed bin Solomon as a great reformer and when the U.S assisted the Saudis in creating the worst cholera outbreak in modern times\nWhen asked whether he might retaliate and stop a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with the kingdom President Trump says I don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's being poured into our country why the jobs\nBut now Trump is saying today he's taking a serious look at this he says we may have to rethink our relationship with these people\nThey say the truth is that Trump is doing a selling job on himself the hundred and ten billion dollar figure is more like a menu of deals he offered the Saudis not a done deal\nThe Saudis have purchased the terminal high altitude area defense anti ballistic missile system for about Fifteen billion that's be\nAnd the state department has announced four billion dollars another completed and approved arms sales to Saudi didn't complete every arms deal the President Obama offered them either\nOne can understand that the practice of geopolitics means that you don't always get to choose your allies\nAnd the superpower cannot conduct business my dealing only with nations like Switzerland and Lichtenstein so we're gonna have to deal with some bad actors out there and they of course to the point is made that when you\nDeal with some of these folks then you have more chance to influence them I think a lot of times that's a cop out it depends on what they're doing for instance I think we have no business dealing with China\nNo business whatsoever but of course the market is so huge that we can't ignore it and we want ignore it and so we're going to deal with a shame now because of the money so it's not about doing the right thing\nIt's about doing the prudent thing and the same thing happens with Saudi Arabia now I don't believe that they mentioned in his speech from National Review it's called Saudi Arabia is still a lousy friend\nI don't think they mentioned the fact that are almost all of the hijackers on nine eleven were Saudis\nAnd then people was that me\nWell it's becoming ever clear over the years that there's no conceivable way these guys did this without somebody in the Saudi Government\nHello this is Chris moslem with Marlins optical service\nWhere your national optical experts

Trump meaning quote that was really sad I think you have there a man who's clearly not okay and the president who's willing to who's willing to exploit that\n\nNow I get some you folks it's really an interesting\nBut I'm just telling you you say well ... just he's delusion that makes no sense\nAnd one guy emailed me and said I mean he was going off about your buildings don't have thirteenth floors I said they don't have you ever check this most of them do so I wouldn't look eighty five percent of buildings in the United states according to Otis my man that's the elevator operator\nYou know they have to inspect the elevators and this is from like two thousand three but there's only the but eighty five percent of buildings did not have a Thirteen floor I've always thought that was stupid but they do that because some people are superstitious and they won't stay on the thirteenth floor they don't want\nThey don't want an office on the thirteenth floor so they just go from twelve to fourteen obviously there's a Thirteen floor but they don't call it that\nAnd so this person thought that maybe ... was delusional and I and I had the pointed out to him\nAnd uh he says we just sounds like he's he's renting I said well he was raining he's mad and he's got all sorts of things that he wants to say in a lot\nOf it is worth hearing I'm telling you especially when it pertains to the black community but the folks on the left don't want to hear this\nSo I was looking at that and then we have the former chairman of the ... the former chairman of the are insane Michael Steele was on with Chris Matthews\nAnd here's what he says Chris was saying\nWell I think he's just using cover of Kanye you know I mean to so that people won't call them racist and seal says\nAnd the fact of the matter is I'm Sorry meeting with Kanye does not absolve you of your position on Charlottesville it does not absolve you on talking about the continent where my ancestors came from as asshole\nIt does not absolve you from building a wall or absolve you of locking immigrant children in cages\nI mean Michael's gone completely over the level of the fact leaves on hard ball she tells you all you need to know\nSo you can meet with Kanye and have your romance moment\nBut the American people see through it and see it for what it is and if you think the black community is going to wake up and go well damn where he met with ... I think I'll vote for Trump that's not how that works what apparently is how it works because now Trump's at thirty six percent support and the black community [noise]\nNow here's the deal\nI re tweeted this story and had to take a Mr Steele task who I like and I met on several occasions but he's just gone way left for one thing the Charlottesville thing was Trump was saying there were bad\nActors on all sides you got Michael Steele asked acting like an ... does not exist that's who was in Charlottesville to meet the white supremacist they're all bad people all of them you can't just say it's the white supremacist were bad and the folks who are fighting them are good\nNo they're all a bunch of idiots and there are all dangerous I Would submit to you\nThat the anti for folks are much more dangerous because people like Michael Steele are taking them seriously\nBut the comment about the Shiite holes which were not even sure this was actually said by Trump but it should have been so I wouldn't look and you go by the you when you go by Amnesty International by any organization\nAny organization out there as far as the poorest countries on earth and where are the folks well\nI'm Glad you asked because I actually did some uh some research on this a team of the top twenty Shiite holes in the world happened to be in Africa I'm Sorry that doesn't make you racist to say so\nAnd as I said ignoring it doesn't help these people\nIt's just the fact Eighteen of the top twenty Shiite holes in the world are in Africa\nSo we just got to ignore that act like it doesn't happen\nOr do you maybe want to do something about it and why are they Shiite holes to it varies but mostly it's because they're run by ten warned dictators\nAnd if you help these folks get rid of those people and actually had some true Republican some of them are called republics but they're not really they're run by ten or an dictators are they're run by pseudo Republican presidents and things like that\nBut if you help these folks take charge of their own destiny you wouldn't have this but sitting there is Michael Steele and calling the the president races for pointing out the obvious they are Shiite holes and we don't even know he said it but I'll say\nThey are these are some of the worst places on earth there\nSays pools do you want to help these folks are not because ignoring that they are Shiite holes is not going to make them not to be a Shiite hole\nI Wish you could use it but [laughter]\nAnyway so we've got that these people are still going nuts on the left about this they just they can't help themselves they can help themselves in the meantime\nWe have another pro life activists attacked and yet another member of the mob attacking somebody else and these folks are saying on the left on CNN specifically the kingdom and use the N word we won't even call them a mob\nBut they are um a ... and sometimes they're a mob of one we've got this recorded it requires sitting university\nThis is the day after that male roundhouse kick the female ... in fact I was in Toronto you remember that story that guy somebody ought to beat the crap out of that dude I mean I'm just looking at is still shove him somebody just neat\nOh my gosh oh my God anyway so it day after that Jordan Hans who's twenty six facing eight counts of assault on seven counts of mischief under five thousand dollars in relation to the incident\nA that was in Toronto now we have asked for the most recent incident video showing an individual wearing a dark green jacket grabbing and knocking down a stack of pro life signs\nThan throwing a Dali that had been used to hold them up right and then the attacker than kicks the signs and then the attacker then goes after the woman who had the signs\nShe through what appear to be a middle class that have been used to hold the signs together and then shove the pro life activists Katie summers\nAre before reaching into summers
