Tallahassee with the crime and everything else and you want to spread that across Florida I don't think so\nSo you're going to have to get out and do what needs to be done and the state of Tennessee you have today and tomorrow to early vote and then you have to wait till election day I'm actually taking I think all of my sons are going to be in town\nHalls are all three sons in town tomorrow so we're going to try to go vote all ... of four or five of us Susan including that'll be sometime tomorrow for the last day of early voting because one of my kids in college just can be only chance he won't be here on election day so I'm going to encourage them when it comes in I think he's coming in tonight\nTonight and he'll be here tomorrow it's got a job interview for some intern ship so he's going to be in town we all go out and vote as a family which is a great thing the family can do\nSee a lot of people talking about yeah I'm ... I'm not going to take it anymore and then you end up not voting your what you know I just\nDid that it's not hard to do follow she going to take let's just say you take an hour out of your time I was making a comment one of my sons the other day when when all of this big thing was one point six billion or whatever it was for the lottery member then I said I guarantee you far more people buy lottery tickets and vote\nAnd think about that were saying you've got virtually no chance of winning but you're going to go out and buy a lottery ticket which I don't have a problem you wanna buy lottery ticket if you've got the money I bought a lottery tickets but if you can buy a lottery ticket you can go vote for crying out loud I mean it's not that hard to do\nHarry ... who back in the nineties in Nineteen Ninety three agreed with Donald Trump and now Donald Trump has been tweeting that Harry Reid agreed with him now says he disagrees with Trump after previously accidentally agreeing with Trump\nReacting to Trump's claim about his views on birthright citizenship the president's been talking about doing this through an executive order and now he's moving towards\nJust running it through Congress and the Congress the side and he I think the experts going to say it's probably going to have to be a constitutional amendments you can see what happens with Congress if Congress deals with it and then it goes to the Supreme Court and Supreme Court says no then you've got started process all over again but I've told you there's an easy way to solve this build\nThe wall\nI mean I've talked about sending the parents back with their kid after they have the kid because the parents obviously not legal and there's nothing in the constitution says they get to stay that's one way of dealing with it but you won't even have to deal with the problem of anchor babies if they can't get across the border to have anchor babies\nSo that's why we need the wall you know pregnant woman is going to try to scale the wall so you're going to do away\nCompletely with that if you just put a barrier up that they can't get across and have a baby on our side of the border there are all sorts of ways to deal with this\nOften said about politics in general they make things so much more difficult than they have to be\nA lot of these problems are very easily solved but they tried to complicate them and the illegal immigration issue is one of them it's not a complicated issue you stay on that side of the border until you have a proper way to come through\nAnd you don't come across our border illegally and if you're going to try to do this we're gonna have to put up a barrier that keeps you from being able to do this and we've talked about a wall for Thirty years or more now they actually appropriated money\nFor the wall and they actually started building part of it we had this store this has been many years ago this was back when I think George W. Bush\nGeorge H noticed George W. Bush was in office\nThey appropriate the money to build the wall and they built the wall like a mile in Mexico and had to tear it down\nYou know I say a wall there was a big fence a structure whatever how in the world do you not have survey years out there that don't know you're a mile into Mexican territory when you're building a wall I think that was done on purpose and then they had to tear that down at great expense and we've had the money allocated for this for\nI don't know decades now and they still have a build the wall you build the wall that will be no more anchor babies\nThis I can tell you guarantee you're not going to have some pregnant woman trying to scale AWOL it's not going to happen so\nThere are easy solutions to this and people just aren't taking them an immigrant Colby here because uh he's has something that I Want to hear about to Kobe how are you\nVery good are you doing I'm doing well what's on your mind\nI just wanted to say ah I'd never voted on forty five years old in my life didn't didn't take it mattered but er and when Trump got office I thought oh that's funny no let's see what happens is that a stir the pot\nBut uh after the end of it have it from the Democrats and really you know seeing how politics is if it's inspired me to vote I so and ... said that uh\nWhat she did what she did and all that spike come up on the last day of registered I was one of those people and they want and cut the ... the the way the Democrats have behaved as inspired me to vote\nMore good so you've been watching from the sidelines all these you you're deciding to get into the game\nYes sir there\nAn hour in Tennessee so you've got today and tomorrow the early vote and then you can vote on election day which one you're going to choose\nI don't know if I get to the early vote and south although I'm from king for us to go to ... but like I said I never voted for I don't even know how to do an early\nWell there early voting places all over the place and you don't even have to be in your area just wherever you find them early voting place you can vote so if you have to run in the last one I mean there you can go online and find them\nThat's probably going to be your easiest um the easiest thing but I mean even if you got to vote in Kingsport you've got to go by the kings for devote so you can't you can't vote in Nashville for Kingsport obviously so you got to go back to where you write to develop\nA I don't mind going home\nWhere he I don't I don't blame you well I'm Glad to see in the game Kobe does my heart good\nYes sir I appreciate you\nAll right thank you Kobe appreciate the phone call for their more colby's out there Jane in Florida you're up next to Jay what's up\nMan I don't know\nI hate it really quick thing to go back to the yard signs Neal\nIt to me it would seem like if people ill yard signs out of people's yards that inspires the person who put it out there first to tell more people about it to get more people to vote so it's almost you understand what I'm saying\nNo yeah it backfires on them is what you're saying sure sure if somebody is like my yard signs I'm mad as hell I'm making sure everybody I Know votes\nRight then they're just going to go get more yard signs and kill other people and now they're so it's not that he wanted him to steal it but they're shooting yourself in the foot\nIn what age juvenile thing to do from a state representative be driving around in the middle of the night stealing people's yard signs\nAbsolutely it's it's crazy\nYou know well how all the letters in ice intense going when I was going to ask you how things looking political wise down in Florida\nAh we're hoping for the best man [laughter]\nYeah well you got me now to you I Know you're going to vote but everybody listening down there's got to get out and vote or this thing and going to happen you're going to have them in in the governor's office\nOh yeah no I uh I Am strongly for a you know I Know I'll be voting and I'm kind of spread the word but a whole knock on wood man\nYeah indeed yes vote and then pray [laughter] yeah exactly right Jay preaching to very much Tom Europe next Tom what about it\nTom\nFell yeah I mean I can hear you now\nOkay sorry about that hey I'm a quick question are you mentioned building the wall and out so they can't bring in and have anchor baby but when you I've heard that forty percent of illegals are overstaying on it though\nAnd and and when they have a baby ... how do we found out that you're\nWell that's a big that's an interesting question I don't know how many of the anchor babies are people who just came across the border of people who overstay their visa I Would assume it's the people who just came across the border if you've got to be I don't know I I Would love to see the stance would be my hands them they probably don't they probably don't cut them that\nStay but it would be interesting to see what I see going on down at the borders you have somebody who's you know six months pregnant seven months pregnant they want to get in the United states for they have the child instead of somebody who who's\nOver here with the visa\nOr I don't think that's normally the person that's you know getting getting pregnant and wanting to stay in court it could be but that's another problem too and you know other countries have ways of tracking people who aren't supposed to be there I Know you know when I go abroad\nYou know I I Can't stay there indefinitely I mean you know they they check you a different checkpoints and if you don't show back up big and they start looking for you and point you made by the way when you try to exit at some point then\nYou're in really big trouble they arrest you if you've overstayed the time you were supposed to be there so there are ways to their way I Am all this but also I think probably we're gonna have to have some kind of constitutional member to settle this\nYeah I I completely agree learned to appreciate

I don't know why they didn't just put that in the amendment would have ...

come in here illegally and you're a citizen of Mexico let's just say\nThat you are subject to the jurisdiction there of of the Mexican government you're not a citizen so you've broken into a country

one other friend\nThat I hung out with that didn't smoke pot everybody else did it was just one of those things so\nThey say the younger you start the better chance you got to have a really stunning your mental development and I had actually seen that in some folks that I knew there were smoking pot from an early age they really don't know they didn't they sort of like were\nIt was sort of like

the mass shooting of a synagogue and Pittsburgh over the weekend\nAnd then lemon jumped straight to blaming white people and Donald Trump for several of the recent events that have occurred after seeing that white people were the biggest threat in this country he went on to say there is no white guy band so what do we do about that so per\nGrey being news his lemons full quote\nYes and then now another one and then you have all of them in a row and you know we talk we message about it a little bit this weekend I keep trying to point out to people and not to demonize any group or no or any one ethnicity but we keep thinking that the biggest terrorist threat is something else someone people who were marching\nYou know towards the border like it's eminent\nAnd the last time they did this a couple of hundred people came and they you know most of them did get into the country so we have to stop demonizing people\nThis is Don Lemon this is this world we have stopped even I mean\nWe have some demonizing people in ... the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men so we gotta stop demonizing people but will demonize white men the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white man most of them are radicalized in the right to the rights\nAnd we have started doing something about them there's no travel ban on them there's no ban on you know they had the Muslim ban there is no white guy band so what do we do about that\nAnd first of all let me just say this Maori style or D is the name and Vicki Jones and they have been lost in all this to people were killed on Wednesday\nThat you've talked about they had been lost in all this and I know that people feel that this story has not gotten enough coverage\nAnd we will honor them to not in our program but going Chris\nSorry so than Chris jumps back in so it's a there we got to realize the biggest terrorist threat in this country is white men\nMost of them are radicalized to the right\nNow the day before it down to Lehman said he doesn't know of any instance were Democrats were killing folks\n[noise] and ah you know we we we don't even need to point to\nYou know the mass shootings we don't even need to point to Steve skull effects you know of course he wasn't murdered but if that guy of seats releases security detail with not been there\nThat would have been an ugly killing field I can tell you that they got what were those ... there'll be nothing to stop him if if they have them if they hadn't shot him and killed him he would have stood there and blown every one of those people are way thank God he was a lousy shot\nBut eventually he would start hitting people because they just couldn't get away from him but I'm a above and beyond that\nWe know now that half the murders in this country listen a little more than half the murders in this country committed by black males and I would never sit here and tell you that the biggest terror threat in this country is black men\nBecause I Know that those\nBlack men who are committing half the murders are a small percentage of black men\nSo when we talk about\nTerror threats and things like this\nThere are very few people that I Know the thing that all of Islam is a terrorist threat now you\nCan say that the Muslim religion turns a blind eye to it or whatever the case may be I'm a little more hopeful than that\nBut when we talk about terrorists we don't call them we call them\nRadical Islam right and that's an accurate description of them you're not saying that every Muslim as a terrorist what you're saying is is that most of the terrorists that are trying to attack the country and this is largely from without you know outside of the country are radical Islamic terrorist\nAnd that's an accurate description but it is a specific description\nNot saying that the entire Muslim world is a bunch of terrorists\nAlthough you will see some and you know the Pew Research center has done some research on this there are a lot of folks in the Muslim religion who condone it\nThere are a lot of folks in the Muslim religion too many for my pleasure who who think that it's OK and surprising\n... some percent believe and this was in Egypt\nBelieve I think it was eighty six percent believe that it's OK to kill somebody if they leave\nThe Muslim religion well that's the textbook definition of a terrorist or certainly a terrorist sympathizers\nHow many white men are in this country compared to how many white men are out there shooting up a synagogue or whatever\nThis is this is the same left that tells us we're not supposed to stereotype that we're not supposed to supposed to plant paint with a broad brush there were just you know we don't do that that's racist\nAnd then Don Lemon is telling everybody and Chris Cuomo that we've got to realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men which is absolutely astounding\nI don't know any white men that have killed three thousand people with an airplane do you I don't know any but that's the biggest threat\nAnd then the trying to tie this guy in the synagogue shooting the Donald Trump is absurd the when you've got Donald Trump the biggest fan the biggest friend the Jews of ever had\nBut they will not stop the relentless because you know they say they say November six coming and they are desperate desperate to Rasul some of that power away from the Republican\nThey're not going to be able to take the White House because that's not on the ballot so what they're going to try to do is trying to they're going to try to block Trump's agenda by taking over the house and or the Senate\nNow and tell you this to well\nThey don't realize is that a lot of I Would say the damage I mean that in a good way a lot of the damage has been done by Trump to the liberals out there because we got the tax cuts we've got the corporate tax cut the economy's coming back and they can't stop that\nThey can vote all of these repeal of the tax bill they want but they'll never they'll never go anywhere even if they take back the Senate to they don't have a beep they will not have a veto proof\nMajority so all he's got to do is veto all of this nonsense it comes down to ... so they can't touch what's in place now what they can do is block everything else that Trump was going to do in the last two years of his first term and I'm sure there's a lot to be done lot still to be done\nAnd if we allow this to happen then what we are going to do is we're going to sort of stunt the growth of this economy the economy will continue to grow but I can tell you the markets\nAren't going to like the fact the Democrats are in charge of the house and Senate even though they probably will have little chance of repealing anything that's going to hurt him they just don't like it and then everybody tells us the worst thing in the world for Washington is gridlock\nWell we ain't got gridlock now we got Donald Trump we got some rhinos trying to block some stuff but we don't have gridlock in other words we don't have everything coming to a screeching halt the Democrats take either the house or the Senate and we got gridlock\nTook your manhood to the max by
