Mississippi book festival up and running and I've read some accounts of\nExactly how you remember it happening and I wondered if you could share with us or you know how on earth did did did you get involved in a concept for Mississippi book festival and how did it happen\nWell um it had its roots in Louisiana I'm I was visiting some friends in Baton Rouge\nAnd um they took me to the Louisiana book festival when Saturday afternoon I'm\nOut of it for your listeners who've been to the Louisiana State capital it's it's the tallest capital in um in America it's like twenty eight stories they built it twenty eight stories so they could put a spotlight on the top of it\nIn ... in the spotlight on Huey Long grave right\nBelow the in front of the capital [noise] um but it's it's a huge expanse of land lots of sidewalks and I'd I'd lived there for four years lobbying at the Capitol and\nMy friends took me to the book festival which was set up on the Capitol Grounds with pimps everywhere in all of the altar panels when the legislative committee rooms and um I'd never been to book festival for didn't had ever heard of a book festival and\nWas just taken aback by thousands of people are roaming around the Louisiana State Capitol listening to authors buying books\nAnd I thought being from Greenville [laughter] you know they're probably to authors who are from Louisiana and there are a hundred and eighty from Greenville in five thousand from Mississippi\nIn Mississippi doesn't have anything like this and how can a state that's produced to authors have a great deal in Mississippi that's got a literary tradition doesn't have one of these things\nAnd um [noise] so I came back in um called up are friendly ... who was had just assumed um directorship of the university press seats ahead retired\nAnd took her to lunch and ask her if she knew anything about it she was from Kentucky that harder from Kentucky so she knew about a book festival and seemed interested in thinking about it\nShe talked to her marketing person Stevie aides who is sort of the ... um the the memories are over there the institution and Lucille knowledge who remembered maybe ten years ago they had tried one you may remember that they had tried one\nOne year in Mississippi and it didn't it was so bad that people that are raised it from their memory and I'm Steve got excited about it in

I'm so John evidence of course it all in the area or got all excited about it and we all put our heads together\nAnd we came up with a working group of people to have a first meeting which just for
