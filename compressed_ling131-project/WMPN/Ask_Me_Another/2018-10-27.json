commercial um portrait photography\nIt's a what you would think that commercial photographer did in Jackson which is anything from portraits to architectural photography to product photography but I've also concentrated on trying to do art work over the last Twenty years in that photography\nI think the um\n[noise] place for art is kind of where you work so that's what I've been trying to do and I think you have a really interesting um\nWork history and that you worked in many different capacities within the arts world not just you know creating art work ... teaching it I mean you've kind of seen all many many aspects of it\nWell here you have to do you make your own way and it's you know you have to make a living and it's\nA it's a great way to live you don't get rich this we all know

trying to make with the artist so come out to the observer if you do it wrong you know you're just\nYou know you you're losing the whole intent of the person so I really when you get a chance to

Patterson in the fall two thousand eleven James ... passed away on October twenty first and so in tribute to him were replaying this interview a and a lot of this focuses on his a fellowship work that he was doing around that time\nWe were talking a little bit about kind of I'm interpreting work and that but and we I Want to talk about your kind of wealthy experience working with the wealthy ... off the photograph the historic photos but maybe first you can talk a little bit about kind of photography and Mississippi and maybe some of the notable photographers if people don't know about they should know about\nWell you know the amazing thing about Mississippi and its photographers is for years and probably until just recently Mississippi is better known for its own\nSo you know we didn't have a lot of people taking photographs and uh\nUh I think you know that really shows up now especially you know at the archives and history see great photos but nothing like the collections\nYou might see in you know or just the number of photos documenting thing you can see that your door a wealthy is a ward of the great exceptions of that in a time where you know it was\nDuring the depression or and all that\nShe was getting out and shooting photographs and documenting our our lives and you know the south or especially in Jackson\nIn a way that you know really hadn't been done before we had library of Congress photographers coming through and all that but that's really people just pointing a cameras at us and then moving onto the next scene\nEudora was internalizing a lot of these things and able to get into places that other people could and so\nThat's where I first started the love her work\nAnd and her work was the ... and ... correct me on the ... some of her work was done 'em for a local or a federal program I mean she was paid to be a photographer for a while right and\nThen she was paid to be a writer and she took her camera long she worked for the W. P. A. or if she had been paid to be a photographer those negatives would be part of the library of Congress like the other ones are but they paid for her travel writing in in some of these other stories\nHer a cameras she paid for her film and process it and she paid for she had her pictures process that standard photo on Capitol street where every everybody knew about that and ah at one time and uh her\nYou know amount of photographs is is it's it's pretty incredible considering that was not her main professions her she was writing and but luckily she took her camera whether it was a fairly\nA huge you know\nTo be\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to MTV music radio [noise]\nMississippi Public broadcasting [noise]\nFor the final segment of the arts our today we're bringing a rebroadcast of a two thousand eleven interview with the photographer James Patterson\nPatterson passed away on October twenty first and were replaying this as a as a tribute to him and his work and we're talking about his work with the wealthy a foot photographs\nIn the last thing that I Want to talk about your work now James on you you have many different uh irons and the fire as far as stuff that you're working on I Know you have\nA creative stuff that you have you know that you do and you have up in your studio space in a founder and but you also do editorial for magazines and newspapers and that what what some of the stuff you're working on right now\nWell I I'm always kind of work for some magazine things I did a racist leave one of my favorite southern magazines gardening gun I did some things for the movie the help for them uh I work with Puerto Rico magazine a lot here in Jackson carrying builder and I are old friends and\nThey give me a lot of creativity or leeway for me to be creative when when I can so you know those those are things like you know portraits of people\nUh maybe an assignment about people that love living in their ah air stream trailer so\nI got to go you know meet meet different people get get some different lifestyle stories some visual things but it's almost like a great way to practice your craft you know\nWhen you get thrown into a story like that you've got to be a problem solver so it's it's a great way for me to keep up I also been really lucky\nTo work for some newspapers and you know do a lot of work with a New York times which has\nBeen great because they give you some funds stories and um they let me shoot things around the state usually with the riders so we have we have a lot of different experiences recently have been a photograph the floods for them I have a\nThey love doing stories about a Mississippi's um the death of the death of catfish the death of caught in the deaths of farming but you know and and and to be really honest they do some really end up stories too they I think they're able to they have great writers that will spend the time\nAnd energy and actually get to know a story so that they're not talking about the death of Mississippi but they they do like to know that you know the the economy or I get to work with the business section I get to work with a real estate section\nMeaning you know what what are the most popular parts of the newspaper it turns out to be\nThe real estate section with you know what you get for a hundred thousand dollars in a house and so I Do get to go photographs that kind of thing\nAnd how is that different how what's the approach from you know a story in the New York times as opposed to a garden and gun which is a more kind of the photography seems a little more maybe controlled\nOr are you you're kind of you're working on the images more\nWell there I think I might even want to call it ... there are a little bit round or they they've got a little more leeway you know when you're working for the New York times you know you have the journalism ethics code that you\nReally should follow on most things some of the uh sections aren't that much if I'm shooting of a story for the New York times that's news you know I Would not manipulate anything at all if yeah if you're shooting kind of an editorial story for gardening gun it you've you've got to sit there and\nMaybe I'm a move around or move to subject around to where the good light is hitting them you know and you could do that on some uh editorial stories but you can't do it on news ... news for anybody to shoot for the sun Herald on the coast as well\nYou can manipulate anything but when you have a little freedom to do like Puerto Rico or gardening gun or a another ... looser section of the newspaper what it does is let you really start learning your craft and being creative and and for the editorial\nStuff for the magazine stuff I mean some of it's just you know they want stuffed looks great you know to make their magazine look great how does how much direction do you get an a thing like that like\nLike the air stream trailer you had some images on your Facebook page of a you know some air stream somebody living in or having an air stream how much direction do they give you as far as what they want to see\nA lot of it's just taking a vague idea that the air stream trailer was really just supposed to be a story about the interior of a home a little playful saying onset of doing the home interiors that we've all seen in magazines and Jackson and all\nThis is more of a um you know a little play on that and to but you know the the couple that on the air stream loved it it's such a cool looking piece of America on I just couldn't just go in and shoot it and take some snapshots or\nYou know I spent you know day or so on on that story just to get when I Lived out of it and you know in in the end you know you're you're hoping you get paid you're helping people like your work but uh\nI think you know like any creative person yeah you've got to like it and if if you don't like it then\nAnd then it's just about the money so I Try to make it a obviously it's not about the money but yeah I Try to make it or I like it\nAnd probably people are also have seen a lot of your work I mean you as a create your creative person that you photograph a lot of creative people and you had a series that you submitted to the the commission for your in your application of mostly central Mississippi but maybe some others of of writers and musicians and uh other visual artists and I was\nCurious about you know you're interested in them is subjects and maybe how you approach some of\nThat you know the creative people or you know it's easy to photograph them because they're the most interesting people to me and you know they are um and they're all funny looking to buy them\nOffer you the ... are very funny that that's the truth is they are interesting people that's why we're drawn to them you know drawn to their work and we're trying to see\nSomething you know about them about their work and them when I when I photographed them too\nBut I've been able to work with musicians with painters with photographers photographic them a really lucky to work with a lot of musicians Bobby Rush a little ... and doing their CD covers which you know really fun and I'm In a in a great way to be a part of music talk a little bit about\nLike maybe like a credit for Bobby Rush has such a specific personality I mean he is more by Bobby Rush is so much himself you know and how do you like when you got that job say okay do uh Bobby Rush a album cover how do you go about showing Bobby Rush in and what was your\nWell Bobby Rush it's half of it is trying to hold him back and for you to keep him on the ground and yeah he's really a lovely man great to work with really creative talent you know you can tell he came out of you know the womb with talent and a hasn't slowed down since but\nWith him you know you ... you really I think he had done so many album covers that were just thrown on there and we started going you know what's the name of the album\nBobby ... is like well you know it's it's called raw so uh with Bobby either you have to take everybody separately but with Bobby you know it is a lot of fun it's great music it's a lot of energy is creative but it is fun too\nSo you would never try to take Bobby into a place that visually that I think even want to go and I've tried it before with a real serious portrait and he just doesn't get it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ask Me Another", "city": "Jackson", "day": "27"}
