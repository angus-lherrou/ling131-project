German\nIn the middle of the set we heard the Carnegie Hall jazz band\nAnd I'm In the words of George wean famous jazz promoter they pretty much the inventor of the jazz festival\nA he was the guy who came up with the idea of the Carnegie Hall jazz band and in the liner notes he said that it was established in Nineteen Ninety two as an as an ensemble that would offer new perspectives on jazz traditions and that it did\nOn the old Glenn Miller swing era classic in the mood rearranged by Jim McNeely to feature John battles on trumpet and also some unbelievable playing by the entire trumpet section\nAs well as the tenor saxophone solo from Frank West\nThat's from the only album that the Carnegie Hall jazz band recorded I Wish there were more they had a great perspective as George wean suggested on jazz history and we finish by just listening to music from tenor saxophonist Illinois ...\nAnd a tune called jumping at Apollo which is back from the in the mood era from Nineteen forty six\nAnd present a splendid example Illinois jak kept ability to create a a great sense of a visceral swing by his use of repeated notes and getting into some guttural sounds which became a key part of his style and would show up\nIn the music we're going to be hearing from the ... chief in just a couple of minutes\nThat whole idea of making you know different kinds of noise is on the tenor saxophone what came to be known as hunting or hunting and hollering\nReally goes back in its roots to the music of Lester Young who didn't really do that\nBut let's to young with Count Basie band and be on the man who really inspired so many of the bebop musicians especially Charlie Parker Lester Young was expert at using water called alternate fingering on the tenor saxophone\nWhat that means is that he can be playing you know and there are things that you can do with the tenor saxophone to get the same note but using different combinations of keys that give it a different quality it's the same pitch for the most part but it sounds a little different\nAnd by alternating though Lester Young could essentially trail on the same note\nOr what does that mean have you seen the piano player using two different fingers to rapidly play the same note over and over you'll notice that it sounds like there's something different about each of those because of the different weight of the different fingers and in a way that was what Lester Young could do with these alternate fingering\nIt was later on that a saxophonist especially those in line all Hamptons ban and especially the one that we just finished listening to Illinois jak cat\nAh discovered that by doing that to extremes [laughter] quite right\nAnd getting louder and louder and sitting on that day no maybe adding some guttural down to it as well they could generate enormous excitement\nIn a performance the audiences would go while it was highly entertaining some people consider this pandering to the crowd but the fact remains that it became a part of ... tenor saxophone in the forties and fifties for many musicians John Coltrane in his early years did some ... and hollering\nAnd it certainly led to other experimentation with saxophone so\nYou're attuned to jobs would be able to answer that we're saying it's a it's a fairly straight line from the honking hollering tenor saxophone down the\nIllinois jak hadn't some of this when you're a player to the wild or ... pounds of later years including the saxophone way of ... the band leader of this group the villain brighter collected\nSome of this where it gets pretty far out there but I Love it in the context of this extended the entire summer music\nThis is text from Peter Pan\nBy Mallory Ortberg performed by Dylan mariners Peter Pan am Mara Wilson as whoever Peter Pan\n\nHey hey me and the guys are renting a yacht and heading to Croatia for this open air festival\nWants to come over you guys still doing that well it's like a rental but we know a guy who says we can use his boat and Hughes super\nCool the when are you leaving Mm id K let me check okay oh also we don't have any sleeping space left on the yacht but we're just going to take the ... the whole way there so you won't even need a bed\n[noise] just are [noise]\nHow long does it take to sail to Croatia ha ha oh M.
