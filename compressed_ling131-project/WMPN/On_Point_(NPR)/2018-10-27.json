[noise]\nWe should go probably ... foreign [noise]\nElse to talk\nTo you on again I\nBecause it does for\nCool that's a clip from the end of the world the music but you're hearing grant Cox and who scored\nA the television series and it is also the name of his new soundtrack album which is available now\nYou know um we've interviewed a lot of gas in the world cafe in the last year and a half and so when I saw that your album was a a called the end of the uh leaping world I'm like oh God I another uh applied\nCurrent political state kind of thing but what I found so fascinating is this record really sort of is is intimate and yeah and it's sort of less concerned about the whole state of the world but the state of these two characters in in in their place in this world\nYeah yeah I mean really it's it's themes that I Do I don't know you know it's it's it's sort of eighty nation isolation\nI I can write I really ... showing you know in these shows and doing at the moment I'm as I'm starting one of the songs at the end of the you know my gosh another ... showing you know that you know this very romantic and\nI'm real city acoustic guitars a good a weapon to some heavy playing and I'm a few ...\nNo I mean it's capable of slang fascists we can do a lot of damage they can they can do a lot of different things ... grant Cox and our guest here on the world cafe can you set up to the next time you're going to play angry me\nYeah we're angry me this was kind of men to be you know the nineties kind of what did they call it ... broke or the day that's my name for it maybe\nIt's just meant to be something that she drank James the boys kind of mixed into and he's had fans at the beginning and the kind of change so I can I can do that so I'm actually right absolutely again is kind of a fun size song\nYou enjoy that had good it's all good\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\n\nI don't so angry lately that I was wrong\nThey said we like they don't know what's wrong\nNot making any sense to me\nI'm just so that ... may\nWell isn't making any says\nAwesome awesome a a real tree to live performance of angry me here Graham toxins our guest on the world cafe [noise]\nSo man I Know you keep up with the hip hop a beef you know maybe you don't okay um but it feels like the world to Britain pop beef yes has come to a close for the most part and you know looking back on it now with the prospect of do that you have do you think at any point that affected the music you made\nIn the sense that there's so much gossip and there's a competition and who's going to be the biggest banned in the does that do you think that ever affected the way you make music\nI'm not really affected my kind of um\nMy life every day in a negative way particularly I I guess when I go out to be constantly reminded me of something I didn't particularly want to be reminded of that I was sort of in competition with other bands that I was um or that I was a shop and middle class English passion right over the place things weren't particularly true in a racist\nWe're we're ... and say yeah I mean I sort of in my general life these things um you being sort of talked with same brushes as there's lots of other people um but ... I didn't take much of anything ready coming out ... and musically anyway throughout the nineties\nSo it's almost like a solid it's almost like the solace the studios where you could like actually work and not feel like you're being judged on who you're ... who you are in your background and you know it's so interesting because that's part of the ... pop thing that most Americans don't know about it's not just the music that you're making but your social\nBackground and and whether you were working class or boozy and stuff like that so it seems like it's nice that you had a place that you could get away from that\nYeah we left the studio you know I mean we we weren't ready taking notes of anybody and you know people are big fans of the British pop band and and all of that how how seeing may not appreciate that all of the bands that are considered pep talk\nBut probably not fans of each other they're friends of other people and doing that and they were doing the right thing and they were all come together I'm probably find it quite amusing that that there was a ... thing into you know to me the by British kind of derogatory or they think it's a very it's a nice word\nAnd say\nSay it's a bit of an odd a bit of an out one because a lot of people what kind of trying to reenact and have their their sixties and a kind of another sixties and uh and and so I've um naively I suppose I was as well thinking that everything in the sixties was really great\nBut you know the same stuff is pretty happening that Israel but even west and I I mean\nPolitically and culturally the sixties was\nDangerous and and challenging and and all kinds of stuff so I'm kind of very different to to the to the nineties but it was interesting that it was really the lost her off a lot of the English record labels and we didn't have the time and pat should have enjoyed it more that's how I spend a lotta time complaining [laughter]\n\n\nThought they did what I\nHear your\nUm\n[noise]\nOh\nOr\nRight now if someone is contemplating saxophone lessons and eighty\nThree midnight she and learn with boys and girls we pay our respects to a small Brock legit what do we get back to World Cafe\n\nBack on the world cafe it's ... in for ... got to pay our respects to Tony Joe white AK the swamp Fox passed away at the age Seventy five on Wednesday\nThe singer songwriter guitarist harp and while while player for over five decades and chanted countless folks with his swamp style of rock incorporating the sounds of country and blues as well he wrote countless songs\nSome that were performed by Elvis Presley Hank Williams junior Tina Turner Ray Charles and more on his last stop to the cafe in twenty fourteen host David dye asked him about the success of his biggest song one that happened in spite of the recording engineer the engineer faded into route\nRight there right whatever particular right when you were recording yeah and I thought that was and what you know\nAnd I got to the small ... to ... so it kind of got accepted that way and it was it was ... from reached law paper ... oh yeah well we won't be down on this here you go this is ...\n...\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo we're all still are you there are also\nVery bad or one more term [noise]\nGeorge has talked about\nWe got 'em worms or something like a turning green [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Jackson", "day": "27"}
