Thirteen fourteen yeah remember we started dating refers to\nFifty eastern do when you were the teams and what your what did you first remember about first meeting each [laughter] like going to ask I wrote I Do remember\nThat Benny was really into music it was clear he was the musician and that he wanted to travel home he wanted he had this big plan of traveling around the world and I I really like that so we so we took out to\nUm [noise] and I'm from a map of the world and\nFigure it out where we're going really yet what did where did you pick did you pick the United states first or or where where did where did you want to and what everywhere we\nWanted to go to Alaska we wanted to go to Hawaii we wanted to go everywhere\nSo you knew that he was this just budding musician when did Ben you figure out that and then he was this like incredible singer or maybe when did you even figure out that you were this incredible singer\nI think I was in an incredible singer I Love music and they left to right\nFor me was the ... the singing was not something so serious and when I figured it out that I really wanted to do that I put in a lot of work and I just I sang so much it it really seems like there were a few years probably between sixteen and\nTwenty six where I feel that's all I did\nA ... and ... are here with me their new records together as hearts is called new compassion I Want to pick up the story in a minute but well we've got you here in in ... performance\nSong that that can be really shows off a lot of what you can do with your voice and it's the way this is hard to live at World Cafe\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nOh that's the way I live here at World Cafe I told you she had an incredible work and it's been so wonderful about his heart's a nice ... and ... are here with me there near record together as hearts is called new compassion I Want to talk about how you made you made the album because you made it you made it in large part in upstate New York right\nWith this was a house that that you commandeer it or is it your house don't tell me a little bit about the place\nYeah we we went through a few different sort of stage whisper Bruce I'm or to work for two years ago we started renting a little carbon in the law was up to be some\nSort of stood up and I'm In um rented the piano brought up all the instruments and bikes and an all looked up in ... there wasn't really an intention to even make a record of the points and then we started we started making music you're sort of\nMorphed into a record ...\nIt sounds like a really like welcoming environment was it like that for you too many\nI mean for me to record started when we left the city and went upstate and wanted to find some solitude because\nOur whole background at that point was that we just left the label that we were personally in a very difficult time even working with each other and we didn't it wasn't so clear to ask what with the next step what was the next step musically what was the next step personally\nAnd also there was no one there was backing us at that time as hearts there was no one that was going to say you have to make this music we want to hear another record so it's really\nA that had to do that in in a way we could be free and go and say let's make a record that's going to be something that we want to make ... and if that's the last thing we do to gather\nWe wanted to be something that we can you know later on show our children basically and said something that was true and it came from us and we didn't care what would happen to it would anyone ever hear it would it ever be released somewhere\n[noise] can you pick a moment on on the new album I knew compassion that I guess in body is like what you the sound that you're able to get out of the space that you're in like a moment that feels like a really good representation of what you're what you're talking about [noise]\nYeah I mean there's a song called a hearing on the record and that's just um mini me on a college just to Mike set up and we weren't even planning to to record of a point but I think we're just sort of set up some Mike's and I'm I'm a\nI had my iPhone running at the same time as well so it all kinds of ... mix them together and uh so [laughter]\nThat sounds incredibly like like a very romantic way to create part um and I want to play healing for people so that they can can picture like being in that room with you to sitting on the couch I'm just doing this like out of the blue here we go back
