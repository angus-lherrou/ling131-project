D. to Oxford\nHey you're listening to a ... today we talk to my old friend ... ask if they don't hear the story of the crossing his new concept album with Italian composer Don Antonio is bad [noise]\nAcross she tells the story of two immigrant boys one from Mexico the other from Italy traveling around the United states all a hundred will tell the story of his father emigrating from Mexico to the U.S into tales from Allah hunters punk rock that like your time is banned open for the Sex Pistols\nWhen the nuns were on stage you know people were throwing all kinds of money cameras off there was a ... show was the end the ... year was the first wave of of\nCourse she seemed to find out if we throw anything if the band today that\nHas ... performs with San Antonio fly coming up on his little cafe\nWarming it up that's what tele aside and I'm stealing it right now which is why I Love it that's right\n[noise]\nKnow from a\nThank you for your\n\nA\nWell for\nMy little girl's\nBombing down\nYou know we would drive\nI mean the when\nNew Orleans and\nConnection between our we worked reaping\nThe kind of music to look into music from South let's see ... and that was something to put us together for a door to door supposed to be a one off\nAnd it became a friendship and a brother who would that lead to the record\nAnd so you guys decide you want to do a record and to prepare for this record you and and tonia spent time traveling around the deep south of America so this is what's fascinating to me\nYou're going to write a concept record about to immigrants in America interview a life long living in American American fiction Italian on a tour of the deep south and Tony what's surprised you about that trip\nOr you know first of all the way they were the other hand or give everything a different feeling because I saw him a being emotional through my emotional lives you know they do the same when you bring people to eat till the end he watched the ... the places that are familiar to you through the rise and you're going to discover them again\nAnd you know the thing about it when I'm On your came over to the you know he\nLanded in Dallas texas you know which is pretty hard core America you know and uh we spent\nI don't know maybe a few weeks I think together and we would go driving around the country roads you know and there was also a lot of people in dollars that we spoke to who were dreamers you know and so we spoke to them and got some of their stories and\nYou know a lot of their stories kind of made an impression on the song\nSo even though you know this area well going out with Antonio and showing him parts of America that that you know\nSeems like you took something away from this this experience as well we\nDo it you know and it's funny when we were drug around in my pickup truck coming from Austin we took the back roads or we go through all these little down you know out in the country\nAnd I remember we drive along and we both be talking just Johnny things down and maybe I was driving I come up with some\nImagery or lyric and I'm telling you would write it down and then he would drive and we talk and maybe you got an idea we started writing down like a you know have no idea that we eventually became the song\nOf the hundreds debate over here along with down and tell me oh they have any record out it is it called the crossing 'em we would love to hear something blue book but if you're in the world cafe [noise]\n\nOh cool\n[noise]\nWe're on World Cafe here with ... and Don I'm Tony up the new album is called the crossing it is a concept record involving two young men shall the NBA go and it is available now just get the ... back to a joined us here\nSo that that's something but what is it about writing sad songs were you talk\nAbout writing sat on the civil liberating\nI don't know you know in that song really is about I think a just a feeling of\nDistance you know and how that can be done the devastating times right\nAnd you're seeing all the things around in that kind of Bangor here many wonders ... you know whenever I gotten myself into into running a melody running the song runny nose singing to someone far away\nI think we all do that from time to time you know walk around singing songs that reminds us of certain times in our lives that were better maybe\nA hundred debate of our guests here there was another line on the album or that says I lost my innocence to ice yeah and you were born in in San Antonio Texas but you and your parents were immigrants yeah what what what was it like for then how did they see the experience of coming when\nMy father was born in Nineteen oh seven you cross when he was twelve years old so his his um\nAdversary was not ... but the Texas Rangers you know who we are very brutal and so\nYeah just skate that kind of thing and make his way to San Antonio where we are relatives and then he was reunited with his parents didn't looming Texas but he was a twelve year old boy when he made the journey from self deal to San Antonio\nWow wow and I think we wanted to speak the language of\nHumans because sometimes when you talk about immigrants you know politicians speak the language of politics which is respectable buddy shoot I'll be Frank grammar any to propaganda you speak the language of ... which again can be respectable buddies so now that our language\nWhen you're talking on a man in need of ads from another man you can only do the language of ... and that's what we try we try to do there are problems obviously there are issues\nThat can be addressed that can be so many different ways but when we're talking about the ... we have to speak the language of the ... and that's why we try to do\nI think that's why it's important to remember that solve own gig or young\nInnocent dreamer right\nAnd so their journey is not to change the world necessarily but doing become part of something right and what they find is a sense of loss because the laws are homeland land that they love they left turns behind relatives beyond lovers beyond\nAnd what they find as a hostile country\nYeah in search of a better life when maybe that better life doesn't necessarily ... at the front door or we're here with all the hundred data and Don Antonio talking about the new album the crossing a\nBut up next a we would love to hear
