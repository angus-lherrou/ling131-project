D. to Oxford\nYou're listening to it on guard is neural cafe I'm only a slender and we're listening back to my chat with rock into a rapper singer death\nSome of the latest album when fired by a unique experiment get that she recruited a team of scientists to try and locate the spot in her brain responsible for heartache through an fmri scan that's trying to get over a love that just wouldn't go away I think a lot of us have wondered like\nAm I choosing to love someone can you choose to stop that that is a truly gifted word Smith and want to ban in fellow rapper and Hamilton creator Lehman well Miranda keen but it does start to perform on his Hamilton Mixtape\nAnd she was pretty excited I did what I think any self respecting an independent rep or do they screamed in my apartment and did a little down death to perform live music from her latest album chime on World Cafe\nOr you get off with a song I think you're going to recognize before we get to the music that I think will be new to you I guess that it's all like God put a smile on your face\n\n\nWhere do we go\nTo see oh my\n[noise]\nThe\nName\n\n[noise]\nOkay that's shrimp always a bridesmaid never an astronaut that's the best laugh lines thanks where did that company I'm um gosh and\nI don't know if I remember the exact moment that fat line hit me\nBut I liked the idea of of being jokey even about big important life concepts you know I think sometimes like humor is a really great way to reach an otherwise challenging topic\nI wouldn't say that all of my songs or maybe even any of them have like specific agendas but yeah I'm sure that at the last three weddings I went to you know if part of me like heard that little proverb running through my head it a bigger part of it was probably you know that's a lame like there\nThere are more ambitious Iraq starts things to want to be than a bright\nSo as somebody who studied philosophy and who is clearly a very deep thinker um what are some of the ethical and philosophical thoughts that go into you being a rapper\nOh gosh I I don't know if it's\nA film and um okay so the first of the most obvious one is a you know I'm sitting in the studio or as a as a bottle blonde was a fair skinned woman um my mother is Puerto Rican but I don't look at so I think one of the first questions was like okay\nWhat is what are the rules for responsible participation in rap I Know that I think about that sometimes I Wish I could say that I had a list of like a really great answers\nBut I think about that a lot more than I used to what I was starting yeah is there one is there one event that is to you like a real it'd be rules bull rapper I'd I'd be honest I I didn't ... it still um but I Would say that\nJim mindful of the fact that I earned through hard work answer talent and through other variables that are actually an earned my position in the world and so then just say okay I Know every once in awhile\nMass to do a job where I think someone could do it as well or better than me I'll say hey you I appreciate it if you would ask them do this job and if they're busy or they say no\nAnd others who yeah\nI don't do you know I'm I'm not saying that that's a constant practice because it's not but in an effort to figure out how to distribute opportunity a fairly I Know that that's one tactic\nAnd I read that part of getting into rap for you had to do with the word count and that you had a license to to say a lot\nUm and I love it that's inherent in your art history and I think he's sort of have that in common with another person with Puerto Rican background than men will Miranda who wrote Hamilton on who you worked with I think you guys have a lot in common actually I'm flattered and honored yeah but I mean the the the way that you use words and sounds to tell stories\nUm I read that if you ah if you stretch out all the words in Hamilton it would be like a twelve hour long play or something like that and that he managed to economically tell this entire story through wrapping this in this relatively tiny tiny amount of space in real estate\nUm so you worked with him you did at you disarm and Hamilton Mixtape rights which is wonderful um and then also he asked you to sing on almost like praying which is the benefits on 'em for Puerto Rico along with\nJ. lo and Mark Anthony and we Fonzie can you tell me um about getting that call from Lehman well and and how you reacted you know as I had the opportunity to get\nConnected initially with Lynn ... on line and I saw Hamilton and was braced for some amazing performances by like multi talented\nPeople I mean these Broadway ... people have like\nReally crazy good pitch if you compare them to a lot of pop back and they can dance where I was expecting to be like impressed technically I left like crying into my like the sleeve of my sweater and trying to hide that for my baby cousin who did my first one\nSo the emotional power that thing really struck me and I left um like a small gift by the stage door of a book that I'd written and I'm a like a little chat\nBook of poetry uh-huh and that was how I'm\n... and I first started a little bit of an exchange and so then when I got the call to be a contributor to the Hamilton Mixtape you know I\nI did what I think any self respecting an independent rep or do I screamed in my apartment and did a little dance and called laser beacon anti Thompson my collaborators in Minneapolis to see if they'd be game to help orchestrate and produce this the song we came up with something that I think all three of us really proud of\nIt's amazing you stretch your voice so far and that song it was so ...\nI mean it was like it's a kind of song has made her rod my voice and so initially I thought man I don't know if we can do this but one of those really exciting about it is I'm recording and Andy Thompson's basement in Minneapolis\nI I'd headphones on and I could hear his voice to headphones you and I can see him you know some just kind of staring down the the barrel of a microphone\nAnd I tried for those really high notes and I just missed them wildly and it was like okay you know give it a given that we don't get on top of him and he was so I'm just worked for like about it where I think I Would have been inclined to be so embarrassed like oh I don't have the voice for this\nMusical you you'd never try this like just sit for a minute you know until you get ten or Fifteen times and get on top\nAnd I did and then I remember leaving his house feeling like well well somebody not try it if I tried to fix dinner Fifteen times I might be able to nail which isn't a sentence about me or you know I haven't ever drastic voice it's not my strong suit but it was about\nReevaluating what I thought adults could learn um so yeah the expansion of of what I had perceived inappropriately as a fix skills exciting yeah okay well let's see what you did okay I live\n\nThat's congratulations I Hamilton Mixtape\nPerformance there by my ... death that I'm working with Lin Manuel Miranda I'm you are very very busy human being a very busy artist you have a book coming out a nonfiction book of essays coming out in September\nAnd ah from what I can lean on line one of one of the essays is called the fool that bets against me and I was wondering if you could tell us I don't I don't want you to give away your book for free church that maybe you could tell us a little bit of that story because I think it says a lot about the way that you approach love and I want to talk about\nSo a lot of the songs that I've written in recorded on my SOLAR Records have been torch songs and that's a that's like a brand of song that's love sick and kind of pining in our relationship but isn't working out that was been good for my career and got a lousy for you know my head space for a lot of years\nAnd as much as you can write a sad love song like so many ways to do it you know\nI remember I had a stomach ache I was reading my mail and I was lying on the ground 'cause we're stomach hurt and I got the Geico quarterly and the guy Kohl quarterly is like a glossy magazine mailer and it's like um surprisingly well done for an insurance company\nAnd it and this particular issue they like ran down some unusual insurance policy\nYou know sometimes you hear about this and on TV or in a magazine that like some celebrity insured her smile or legs or her you know her chest or whatever and\nI was reading about some unusual policies like really unusual ones are big companies will ensure against um abduction for their big CEOs or somebody took out an insurance policy against the existence of the Loch ness monster and then [laughter] and like I was going on this rabbit like what is this and then I read about the insurance policy which was\nTaken out by the silent film star called Ben Turpin and he had crossed dies\nAnd she insured has crossed dies because those are his professional aspect you know he built his whole thing around them so he had like a car made that had crossed dies and every time he hit his head really hard he'd rushed to the mirror to make sure that I hadn't gone straight and she insure them I think I Want to say for like twenty five K.\nAnd it was reading his policy that I thought okay well what would my thing will be and in some ways I was disappointed to discover the like wow a lot of my [noise]\nMy songs run on heartache\nLike that's my cross size you know the thing that isn't good for the man that was good for the film star and so from there I decided I Would uh see if I could take out an official insurance policy that essay the flu that bets against me tells the story of trying to ensure\nThe heartache that was feeling a lot of these songs wow you also did another really interesting with heartache um did another really interesting thing with heartache which was try to locate it force in your brain yeah um I watched a Ted Talk by a woman named Dr Helen Fisher\nThat's not a fix that stock yeah so what's the ... ...\nYou got to be able to make your way in the living without sexual exploitation sexes one was one power mechanism and I think it has its\nPlace there's a place for highly sexual lives are but there has to be a place for art that's not highly sexual ... to that can't be the only door it yeah we do fire drill for us I well yeah and a a big thanks to the members of my band today some Matthew Jonathan and\nCar yeah\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nThat the ... catalog and then the\nSecond thing that actually I made a ... model born in the\nHacking at Israel\nAnd you can\nYou can and some of them said Long Branch and I can't watch everybody loves the formula\nWar that you can live in one of my own little world off limits oh\nAnd then when I\n\nOf the blue and advisor\n[noise] what would\nWell what\nThat fire drills and that is brilliant and you can listen to it again and you should it's by death says she is my
