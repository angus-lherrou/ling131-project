people ... um the the world loved it you know they love they loved it but the church people were like still stuck in that old mold\nA you can't do that kind of music and go to heaven you know and um I was just into that religious kind of a mindset and I felt guilty\nBut it was it was a it was a challenge and I had to just think about what what's wrong with it\nWhat's wrong with me doing gospel and soul music it's all about life\nWhere we live that every day all of us do we go through changes every day we get divorced we get married we we break up we make up we do all these things and just
