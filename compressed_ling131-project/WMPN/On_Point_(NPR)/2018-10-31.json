I think that's sort of where it was coming from but it was such a sweet little sounding so I was joking with a friend of mine that my most cynical songs\nAlways come across as as the sort of headline of them and I remember a French the the most cynical songs come across as ... as we or as you know I'm\nAs they appear but then I I also don't know whether um whether it's me that ... that you know because maybe that's the part of me that writes it down is not a cynic maybe I Am hopeful that I can leave my kids are in a beautiful world\nAnd so that's what comes out of me and and maybe it in my book analytical brain I'm like there's no way we can wake up a green human race and then turn around\nWe can't even face what's happening now how are we supposed to change the direction you know so those are two things that I have I Hope that my children have a wonderful an easy life but then I Would say but that's about as you know likely as the world's spinning the other way\nWell this is going to come tomorrow okay yeah okay yeah\nDid not use them as real [noise] gotten to the smoke is making a deal [noise] bridges from her mom was a number of days [noise]\nWe're in the world I don't\nI just [noise]\n\nThat's come tomorrow as head of ... states Matthews band latest record\nCome tomorrow are backing affair by brandy Carl out the tremendous brandy Carlisle\nUm and I read that you\nEnded up on stage at the march for our lives rally in Seattle because brandy Carlisle style you there and you were marching with your daughter like as a civilian yeah that's a beautiful story is that true like is that how it happened\nYeah it is but except that I saw a brand new first so I um I think you took your daughter yeah my daughter and I went on a ... a daughter wasn't feeling so well so my daughter grace is there still stayed home that great a great thing that I uh went\nI'm just ... thousands of people there it was it was a it was a beautiful march or is it specifically cool but it was organized by\nKids and so I snuck up I slept around brandy in and then\nActually it was um the twins that noticed me first and they were everywhere yeah okay I play with her yeah and then at first they were both ... there was a little over there like ... and then they recognized me so actually I I just I found brandy and then she she said you know you should\n'cause I knew she was going to perform there and um she's one of my heroes um\nMusically and just to just awesome\nPower house and so she said you should play something and so I went up and just played one song I bought her guitar I think I played mercy um is is just as simple as a simple so\nIt's not as simple but what I mean this is a simple\nMessage right yeah we should play a bit of mercy at least say that people can can can feel at that moment when in picture I work I\nDo\nThe mess we're making good you know whole God willing to\nWe do to\nSame things you don't want to trial\nCar\nDo you watch the\nAt the mercy from Dave Matthews album between twelve hours away from the world that's the Sunday perform on stage at march for our lives in Seattle at the invitation of brain to Carlisle my perfect song that must have been for that moment coming up dates reaction to hearing his song crashed into me used in some Lady Bird more with Dave Matthews band let me get back to World Cafe\nDo you know sorrow\nStrange so on and so\nIs\nOf despair a stone strange\nJust like so much for starring Robert Byrd\nThat amazing makers on stage of the day ... band concert can pick up the crowd because they're singing so loudly along with that that's a that's a from a recorded interview in Camden New Jersey Dave Matthews band live on stage so\nMuch to say well ready for some more more days coming up we've got more to say we talk about the bans recent lined up change a violinist Boykins we left in February ... family and health reasons and later faced allegations of sexual harassment which he's denied talking about Boyd coming up among Cathy\n\n[noise]\n\nHey welcome back to this on ... World Cafe I'm telling you slang or whether thing back to our session with the bad news from this past summer\nWhen they released their latest record cause the common tomorrow I'll this is a band that fans certainly value for all of its members in the way they came together they've named as the bandstand and he's been at the helm since Nineteen Ninety One or there are certain things that you that you will always need to be in charge\nOf like if there are saying is it like that that last word that like I said as probably the ... or ...\nYeah I mean I I Do this a list I'm\nI'm learning more and more when I should step up and um\nI lost of I lost a great friend I'm\nMore than a decade ago now just graces almost precisely a decade ago are late sax player um who's the first person I asked if you'd be interested in playing music with me I'm In the van right liberal and more and\nAnd it's funny we had a very difficult friendship and he calls me the greatest joys in my life but also cause me the greatest agony so that's the you know as a great friend uh he\nWas very hard on himself um but still managed to shine a great light but after he died as always amazing little bits of wisdom that ... that I remember was such clarity that were more clouded sometimes when when we were all live in we're in the\nIn this in the last in the small talk and one of those things was when the ban was having a really hard time and is actually in a session that is part of the new album a Roy took me aside and said ah\n'cause his album has been a long time coming uh we put on a couple of ... in the middle of since we started this one a and Roy said to me if you don't\nLeave this band we're gonna blow apart or something more or less to that effect he said you got to get in front of us that doesn't mean you have to be an ass you just have to take the reins\nBecause somebody has to be steering and so that was a beautiful thing to learn and I only really adjusted it after he passed but there's a lot of things he said that I I've taken more heart and I\nFeel more devoted to since she passed\nI think we should play the sound that he and appears on on on the record which which one is that\nWell he appears on a few of them let's take my um\nThere's a song that is called can't stop which is pretty aggressive song about addiction I suppose but really about devotion and ah\nI don't know it's a crazy thing it's about love the whole record is about love but in different forms and this one\nIs about inescapable love but as I guess it's not only a\nResignation but when we wrote that when we were working on this song is almost a live performance but it's such a meaty version of the song yeah and I uh\nI Love it and it has him aggressively and it's his ... his ... his counter ... always are invisible in some ways and most visible and most beautiful in other ways they always lifted everything up I think it's a strange thing to say but I Do think he's one of the most underrated\nSex players or or maybe your musicians or in the modern world and he's just astounding\n... I Can't stop [noise]\nI Can't stop that is the second track Dave Mackey stands\nLatest record called come tomorrow it's funky Frankie Frankie lap band that you had when you started out with a band with a violin and saxophone in it which is not a typical combination in a rock band did you have a vision and know that it would work or were you like let's just get an accounting I can and will figure it out later\nNo really wrong\nIt was personalities and it wasn't so much what they played\nIt was these musicians that I loved and I was working with the uh\nUnder sort of the guidance at the time of a of a man named Ross Hoffman\nAnd he said well who would you in you know in your dreams who do you want to play with you and I said liberal and more Carter Beaufort\nAnd so I had a ... caught on drones and it really was just how attached I was\nTo listening to those guys play music and I mean I worked in a bar with ... played quite often I bar tended there and I served him a lot of drinks at this at Miller's at this bar in Charlottesville card and I didn't really know each other we knew each other a bit um\nI loved him was now in the band and we were we had become friends over the years in terms of funding recordings but um he had his own band and so I didn't bother him\nAnd then Stefan came a little later he was available under you use a student of another musical friend of ours um and Roy when you're working on one of the earlier songs a song called tripping Billy's said we should get a violin on this and he made a couple of people in\nAnd then we said well how about the guy from the boy tens we've been obviously she also had a tendency toward naming Benji creatively and we called on him to come\nUp and play on chicken so that people can get a sense of that came out there that [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Jackson", "day": "31"}
