stories and you're going to hear what talking heads sounds like through an African scale which is super duper cool\nAnd she's going to talk about the one time she performed with David Byrne at Carnegie Hall\nAnd of course some of the musical lessons that you know the talking heads preached on remain in light and some of those costs rhythm the angel league says reminds her of home you can hear on listening went from Maine and light talking heads World Cafe [laughter]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nOf foreigners infantry houses [noise] busy [noise]\n\nIn the\nWhen it comes to make them recover communist German our number [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou're listening to the world cafe that's alive version across site and painless a cover of talking heads for Maine and like a song for song cover album of the classic record by the same day you're listening to the world cafe our guest\nIs singer songwriter actress activist in all around awesome human being please welcome back angel leaky Joe ... am so happy to be back how are you doing I'm doing great can't complain beautiful you have something very awesome to talk about today and I'm\nGoing to start a little bit slowly on it you were born in ... and you moved to Paris and you're related to me early twenties [noise] is that where you discovered western music\nNo I mean I grew up listening to all kinds of music back home that started with traditional music for my country and I went to the theater remember my mom and my brother that I used to do a lot of music with them and in the thing that happened is that in the middle of the seventies\nOr with the ... coup in ... in the military took over the country and he became so many little regime addicted to shape and uh\nThe radio that I used to listen to the music that I was allowed to listen to freely in my own meaning the radio but go really bad and he was open to other music from one day\nFrom Monday through Sunday seven fifty four hours and and it was just like depressing so I'm One of the reason I left was that I Do I Do not accept the fact that I Wish I write music to praise in ideology that takes my freedom away from it\nNice to when I arrive in for us in the early eighties\nI was the music junkie I just like I was so if I was still Thursday I was hungry for music that I that I thought that the world have passed me by ... ... ... us all\nAnd he was kind of difficult difficult for me to catch up with everything that happened all the men but I did I did I listen\nTo a lot of stuff we're here with Andrew we keep talking about uh the new album remain in light it covers the talking heads record when did you discover the talking heads what was your body\nActually our body with friends when somebody blew a ... ... that was going to be elected you know you can kind of music even music we when I was looking back home was between the seventies the eighties and and the new stuff that will will come in\nAnd then he play once in a lifetime in and it stopped playing and nobody was dancing she was just they didn't do it like this I'm like this African music why don't you start moving in that they know he's an African music is rock and roll\nI ... yeah well but he's still obligated to me that they are going to be but I'm not sophisticated enough to get a music I'm All right all\nIn the sense of anxiety that I ... in the remaining lot album when I got my entertaining I was able to listen to a couple of years after\nIs a kind of I didn't know the the the that this album was the album would release during the Reagan Era and what was going to number the pretty much in front I didn't have that much of a good idea\nBut I felt that anxiety when I listen to the war with them and because I was so also ... you know steady and the value of my country\nI didn't want to listen to the second time because it was just who it was supposed to take my son just turned my guts inside out and I'm not it's still with me in that same feeling comes after the election in November last year\nAnd I'm like something is wrong about or like we're all so how do we approach these how do we bring joy to people that are feeding lost\nIt it's a lot of things that comes to my mind when I decided to touch up on this and exactly because the checking it that the the words that everything about them between eight and ... but that ... not to um um it's not number you so you just\nThink ... ... you you have to go OK I Want to be some ought to do something\nAnd for me that's why I wanted to do these ... the cover up the oil out of them\nBecause some ... meaning for me\nActually she joined studio let's listen to a live performance in Studio once in a lifetime on the world cafe [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nActually show live once in a lifetime and absolute party here at World Cafe live for our non commercial\nConvention that we had back in may coming up more Angelica key Joe where she talks about meeting David Byrne and having him perform with her at Carnegie Hall plus more live music in a moment when we get back to the world cafe\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nUm I didn't know the ... at the time or in recent years that the talking heads based cultural appropriation issues would remain in light because they were influenced by failing to tea and afro beat and so people said they just took it and used it but yet you disagree with that\nI Do the Rico Brittany okay because if you want to hear the the ... the afro beat they seem to mind in bed with the the ... original uh we many light mhm I mean that's the thing is\nWe're living in LA it we can have to be controversial and I think that because he's going to go see it it it is the doo doo ruled off we tended to\nAnd it we don't have the suit and trust anymore but no more society ... so I don't I don't believe in cultural appropriation goes without probation for me at the court will mention because if somebody ... you would you\nYour music you expanding what the person that don't be fooled mhm\nIt means to be talking about because of the appropriation no one can say I've been in since the muddy water\nI mean you you need a role model in everything we do but they didn't take it literally from Santa ... you're listening to I Will be dead in put it in their what they do was the loop of the drums the idea of looping\nSomething ... and ... and ... and and what if you listen to the ducking head is the best line that he knew that play ... is the exactly the same lines from the beginning to the end of the song they didn't do anything really from Fayetteville equity\nBut when that album was we need to get them to forget that the press release that said we have been influenced by ... and we urge we we encourage you\nTo read this book in these ... that'd be reading what we're doing the album people are funny potential if you don't you just take the time oh reading what they asked you to read that if you listen to what they asked you to listen to you could tell them that they did the ... round me doesn't exist\nFor me is stealing it costs about appropriation is when you dig somebody song mhm are you put your name on it\nOr yeah or there's a fine difference fine line between hearing the music of Fela Kuti and going I'm inspired by it I Want to make something or just blatantly stealing something or not understanding your privilege things like that\nWe have to be attention more to each other yes because as I said before this war world is becoming more and more blue more people are moving more and more if you don't treat people with this country writing when you go swim with somebody treat you wrong\nYou have nothing to say because you've done that and I always say to people before you speak be mindful of people around you you can't just say things I think that it's OK mhm because if you say it's okay then somebody walk in front of your ... your ... names or you can do\nIt's OK yeah people just think that it's okay to just be aggression people and find it funny when you do that means that you were miserable person yes that you're not happy you are insecure and you have some issue with yourself and deal with it and leave people out of your music\nAnd don't say just kidding after you're done yeah as you because we know even as we know ... it's even worse\nWhen you see I'm just kidding just 'cause I'm not really you want me to put your nose and you tell me tell you I just get in you stop bleeding you liked it I mean\nFolks don't mess with actually key joke I don't do that quite frankly I don't I don't punch people don't do that with my dog yeah you've got more important things to do that I perform alive version of that are born under punches here on the world cafe
