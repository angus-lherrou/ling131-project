America [noise]\nThank you Chris I'm about half of life from here I'm resuming my journey across the country chairing the good stories of our fellow Americans this week I was on a road trip traveling down along\nThe northeastern Portland Maine to Long Island sound fall is slowly emerging but the leaves starting to turn in the last two summers warmth lingering in the air but the locals know what's coming and could be seen pulling out their snow shovels and practicing they're unhappy winter faces\nThe first person I ran into was John working at a hotel shining shoes he's eighty six years old and decided to spend his retirement but working at yet another job\nWhat else am I going to do is walk around the mall and count my steps that sounds like the way they torture you on a Turkish prison I had it down to the war is looking for a lobster role and took a seat in an outdoor cafe overlooking the water\nI met a middle aged couple who are enjoying a drink in the sun from the playful way they interacted I thought they were on their first date but it turned out they've been married for eleven years and funny enough still like each other carrion Brian met in Portland while attending a mini kiss concert\nMany kisses a kiss tribute band made up of all the little people\n[noise] Kerry said I walked in and saw Brian across the room because we were taller than everyone else [noise] I figured I\nAm wearing face makeup he's wearing face make up we should make out\nHe squeezed your hand while she told their story we don't go out much anymore but we still love kids she showed me a picture on her phone Brian with a giant beer belly dressed up in his very own kiss costume\nKerry said I like this picture because Brian looks like gene Simmons if he ate one of the guys from many cats [noise]\n\nIt was time for me to take it over to get my rental car for the journey down the coast I was picked up by Sean he's twenty five and it's been driving for the past three years ever since he lost his job as a moving company he loves Maine but he's not looking forward to the cold\nYou said that the winter was so bad last year when spring finally came he throughout all this long pants and protest now he's in trouble\nHe said I saw the survivor show and discovery where a guy never wore shoes are pans he trained his mitochondria with his mind to not feel the coal\nShowing figures he's watched enough of the show to give it a shot even though he's not sure how to do it or what might it might have country it is\nI picked up my midsize rental and headed down the coast along route Ninety five\nIt was a beautiful ride that ended at the Oregon points ferry across the Long Island sound to the far eastern points of Long Island\nAs we pulled out into the sea I was reminded of how beautiful the east coast truly is and the boats make me sea sick\nI get claustrophobic I don't like being trapped we're nowhere to go that's why I don't go on cruises it's like paying someone to put me in a hostage situation [noise] have you ever close\nYour eyes and held onto a railing for dear life and when you came to realize you were hugging a man from Bridgeport, Connecticut\nWhen we finally got to land I found a hotel in Riverhead New York and flipped off the nausea\nLater that night I went to a seafood restaurant and sat next to three white guys in their seventies who looked like retired fishermen\nThey wore faded jeans and washed out T shirts two of them at messy gray hair under tattered baseball caps and the other was his bald as a clam\nSuddenly in the corner of the bar a woman started singing karaoke it seemed weird in a place like this but a crowd quickly gathered around as she felt it out me and Bobby McGee the fisherman just scouts\nAs she ended the strong applause one of the crusty old fisherman marched up to the microphone as if he was going to pull the plug on the whole affair but then he grabbed him Mike closed his eyes pointed at the D. J. and David Bowie is China Girl kicked in\nI was in shock without even looking at the monitor this gang really old guy was killing it\nHe had a bar filled with people half his age holding up their cell phones and dancing along\nI looked over to his friends but they kept right on eating buffalo wings as if he does this all the time he entered into a standing ovation and shuffled off and before I knew it his bald friend was up there without taking his hands out of his sweat shirt pocket\nHe bounces round head from side to side stopped and Bon Jovi living on a prayer began the entire bar lost their minds\nEveryone was screaming the lyrics with the IRS held high as this old dude rocked out with less emotion than a plate of oysters\nI never saw anything like it a very attractive waitress was hugging the tall fisherman and showing your phone case with a picture of David Bowie on it but bald guy was shaking hands with strangers as women squeezed him and kisses had\nHave you ever thought that you're eating in a seafood restaurant in Long Island but it actually discovered the fountain of youth and ended up singing I've got you babe in the eyes of a salty old fisherman\nAnd I'll definitely be back until next time this has been Tom Papa out in America [noise]\nSome [noise] for for John Hoeven performing\nNear here from Livermore performing arts center October twenty
