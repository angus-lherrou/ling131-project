smiling faces the place holders us all we people\nSlowly gray slowly leaving who make\nAll this all possible\nThis activity this festivity this hope this dream dreamt with open eyes\nWith close ties friends of the deceased the diseased friends of the disowned and of course\nThe house was ready for them Margaret had made sure that it was cleaned and emptied of the qualities which attached so surely to her position of wife alone with small children\nThe toys which small John had thrown around with the usual freedom were picked up the baby's close no one after all came to call when John was gone were taken from the kitchen radiator where they had been drying\nAside from the fact of the house gave no impression of waiting for any particular people but only for any one whale bread and clean enough to fit within its\nSmall tremor walls he could have passed for a home Margaret bumped even for a home where a happy family lived in domestic peace\nShe set the baby down in the play pen and turn with the babies bonnet and jacket and her hand and saw her husband head bent gravely as he listened to small John\nWho she wandered suddenly you see taller that\nIs not my husband and she left\nAnd they turn to her small John curia send her husband with a quick bright recognition she thought why it is not my husband and he knows that I have seen it\nThere was no astonishment in her she would have thought perhaps thirty seconds before that such a thing was impossible but since it was now clearly possible surprise would have been meaningless some other emotion was necessary\nBut she found at first only peripheral manifestations of one her heart was beating violently her hands were shaking enter fingers were cold\nHer legs felt weak and she took hold of the back of a chair to steady herself she found that she was still laughing and then her emotion caught up with her and she knew what it\nWas it was relief\nI'm Glad you came she said she went over and put her head against his shoulder it was hard to say hello in the station she said\nSmall John looked on for a minute did then wandered off to his toy box Margaret was thinking this is not the man who enjoyed seeing me\nCry I Need not be afraid she called her breath and was client there was nothing that needed saying for the rest of the day she was happy\nThere was a constant delight in the relief from her weight of fear and unhappiness it was pure joy to know that there was no longer any residue of suspicion and hatred\nWhen she called him John she did so to me or really knowing that he participated in her secret amusement\nWhen he answered her civil either was she thought an edge of laughter behind his words they seem to have agreed sober lead that mention of the subject would be in bad taste might even in fact in danger there pleasure\nThey were hilarious at dinner and John would not have made her a cocktail but when she came downstairs from putting the children to bed the stranger met her at the foot of the stairs smiling up at her\nAnd took her arm to lead her into the living room where the cocktail shaker and glasses stood on the low table\nThe fire how nice she said\nHappy that she had taken a moment to brush her hair and put on fresh lipstick happy that the coffee table which she had chosen with John and the fireplace which had seen many fire's built by John and the lows sofa where John had slept\nSometimes had all seen fit to welcome the stranger with grace\nShe sat on the sofa and smiled at him when he handed her a glass there was an odd elicit excitement in all of it she was entertaining a man\nThe scene was a little more to buy the fact that he had given her a martini with neither ... nor onion it was the way that she preferred her martini and yet he should have not strictly known this but\nShe reassured herself with the thought that naturally he would have taken some pains to inform himself before coming\nHe lifted his glass to her with a smile he is only here because\nI Am here she thought\nIt's nice to be here he said\nHe had then made one attempt\nTo sound like John in the car coming home\nAfter that he knew that she had recognized him for a stranger see it never made any attempt to say words like coming home or getting back and of course she could not not without pointing her live\nShe put her hand and his and lay back against the sofa looking into the fire\nBeing lonely is worse than anything in the world\nShe said you're not lonely now are you going away not unless you come to\nAnd they laughed at his parody of John\nThey sat next to each other at dinner she in John had always said that formal opposite ends of the table asking one another to politely pass the salt and butter [noise]\nI'm going to put in a little set of shelves over there he said nodding toward the corner of the dining room it looks empty here it needs things\nSymbols like she'd like to look at him his hair she thought was a little darker than John's end his hands were stronger this man would build what ever he decided he wanted built\nWe need things together things we like both of us small delicate pretty things um I agree\nWith John ... she would have felt it necessary to remark at once that they could not afford such a delicate pretty things and put a cold finish to the idea but with a stranger she said we'd have to look for them\nNot everything would be right I saw a little creature once he said like a little tiny man only colored old purple and blue\nAnd gold\nShe remembered this conversation it contained the truth like a jewel set in the evening\nMuch later she wants to tell herself that it was true John could not have said these things she was happy she was radiant she had no conscience\nHe went to be the lead to his office the next morning saying goodbye at the door with a room full smile that seemed to mock the president the subsidy for doing the things that John always did and she walked him go down the walk she reflected that this was surely not going to be permanent\nShe could not indoor having him go on for so\nLong every day although she had felt little about parting from John moreover if he kept doing John's things he might grow imperceptibly more like John\nWe will simply have to go away she thought\nShe was pleased seeing him get into the car she would gladly share with him indeed gave him out right old that had been John's so long as he stayed her stranger\nShe laughed while she did her housework and dress the baby she took satisfaction in on packing his suitcase which he had abandoned and for ... and in a corner of the bedroom as though prepared to take it up and leave again if she had not been as he thought her had not wanted him to stay\nShe put away his clothes so disarming Li like Johns and wondered for a minute the closet\nWould there be a kind of a delicacy in him about John's things\nThen she told herself no not so long as he had been with John's wife and she left again the baby was cross all day but when small John came home from nursery school he's first question was looking up eagerly whereas\nDaddy daddy has gone to the office and again she left at the moments quick sly picture of the insult to John\nHalf a dozen times during the day she went upstairs to look at his suitcase and touched the leather softly\nShe glanced constantly as she passed through the dining room into the corner where the small shelves would be some day and told her self that they would find a tiny little man all purple and blue and gold to stand on the shelves and guard them from intrusion\n...\nThe floor of the ... slopes down from the elevator so the laundry cart roles forward on its own as though pulled by an invisible hand\nLike it's going to race down the hall and crashed through the door of the morgue that's creepy to\nTo be honest the morgue doesn't scare me much I don't really understand why the other girls are so afraid of it they see people dying all over the hospital while they type their reports or eat cream puff in the lounge\nThe job is even kind of nice\nEspecially when she's next to me she's a beautiful underground as she is in the office her face all white and pale\nDermatology too short cardiology one long oral surgery one short no matter how long we work the mountain never seems to get any smaller he shouldn't be in the end do lab this afternoon she says without looking up and ...\nRight I agree it's Monday\nI Know the whole schedule by heart I can manage here if you want to go no she says running her finger down the list oral surgery no need her boyfriend is a resident and respiratory medicine and right about now he's probably putting an end just go down someone's throat\nI pick up the next coat turn it inside out and shake it something falls out of the pocket and rolls across the floor I dried up plum\nLooks like a testicle\nI've given up trying to figure out how this stuff gets in their pockets and this isn't even the weirdest thing I've seen\nFlower bulbs bras corks a Bible a little eggplant condoms\nYou name it he was supposed to come see me last night but he never showed up she says\nMaybe one of his patients took a turn for the worse I say tossing the plumbing the trash he went to see his in laws to tell them about the divorce\nHe said he'd come and tell me how it went the doctor's wife went home to her family last month to give birth to their third child first girl I knew all the details he\nWas full of excuses again something about the train getting stuck in snow he claimed never even got there he sat on the train the whole time and had to come back without seeing them can you believe the nerve she expects me to believe a story like that with the cherry trees already in bloom\nI don't know I say he couldn't be telling the truth freaks snowstorms happen you should check the weather report if he was going to lie to you he would have said it was a patient she doesn't seem to be listening\nSince the day I started my job at the hospital I've always enjoyed working with her she's a hard worker and she doesn't take brief from the doctors or anyone else and\nShe's beautiful I never get tired of looking at her and must be nice being that pretty I especially like to watch her work\nThe way her eyes light up in front of the computer screen that cute little ear that sticks out from under her hair when she answers the phone\nBut best of all is her tongue\nAnd she was looking those blue airmail envelopes flicks out on waste and read and runs over the glue we edge\n\nI wouldn't mind having a peek down one of those scopes I say just to make conversation she nuts but she's still not listening to the next coat has blood stains I Wonder whether the patient suffered much before I toss it in the cart\nThey used one on me when I was a kid I add a peanut went down the wrong too and I couldn't breathe nearly suffocated so weird that one peanut\nCould kill you she doesn't answer so I go back to reading labels the room smells like death and disinfectant the two of them have been doing it all over the hospital in the war the labs the broom closet maybe she's even put the end a scope down her throat [noise]\nBut she looks as good inside as out\nWarm bread inviting all those little wrinkles tempting you deeper\nAnd deeper [noise] she\nKnows exactly how she wants a job to be done\nTwenty pages or fewer gets a paper clip more than twenty a binder clip sugar packets are for staff meetings sugar cubes forget\nThe surgery schedule is expected to be blown up a hundred and fifty percent and copies posted on the bulletin board upper left hand corner on the side of the equipment locker and on the door to the lounge if a patient gives you cookies or other food it goes on the middle shelf in the cupboard\n\nNot long after I started working here some big wig and neurology asked us to help with a presentation he was going to give it a conference and all these graphs and charts that he wanted it back in just two days she split the work with me and we typed up labels for this live use the number five oh wait stickers for the slides she told me there for conferences number five oh wait\nWas adult gray\nI did the job just the way she asks but when the doctor returned to pick up the presentation he took one look at it and threw it back on the desk it all tumbled down onto the floor this color won't show up on the projector he said I'm terribly sorry she said stepping in before I had the chance to say anything her apology was really smooth\nI told her to use number six oh wait as usual but it's my fault for not checking she's new and I think she's a little colorblind\nI'm very sorry we'll get it done by the end of the day the doctor said he'd be back later and stormed out\nColorblind for a moment I wasn't\nSure what she said just that she sounded really charming when she said it number six so wait was bright blue she had definitely told me number five oh wait I knew because it was\nThe same number as her apartment I wasn't likely to make a mistake about something like that\nAnd she had given the presentation one more passed before the doctor had come to get it\nI started picking up the papers it's your mistake she said you fix it I didn't finish until way after midnight I felt like I was thinking in some kind of gray swamp\nThe next morning she handed the news lies to the doctor as if she'd done them herself he seemed really embarrassed he'd made such a fuss and he asked her out to lunch to apologize I was not invited\nI never said a word of what happened not to any one I was willing to be colorblind if it would keep her perfect\nI told you she got pregnant just what he was about to ask her for the divorce I shake the next coat and to cafeteria tickets fall out of the pocket one for spaghetti with meat balls and one for a cream soda I bet she did it on purpose part of the evils scheme\nShe's looking at me but she doesn't seem to be writing in the register anymore either she's usually such a perfectionist but she can get pretty sloppy if she's thinking about her doctor when\nI asked him if he'd even told her he got defensive and came up with all these excuses they're worried about the boy getting into the right to elementary school his wife could go into premature labor he's got some experiment running at the lab and can't be distracted the train got stuck in the snow load of crap\nShe stopped for a moment and I read the label on the next coat she writes it down in the register I think\nThe coasts or in a pretty sorry state all wrinkled and stained blood spit urine tears you can tell by the color and the smell it's amazing all the stuff that can use out of a body\nOne lie leads to another I say she should know\nHe finally showed up past ten last night dog tired for being stuck on the train for five hours he said but I was the one who was tired tired of waiting all that time of running to the door at every little noise watching the dinner I'd made get\nCold she runs her hand through your hair looks down again her skin is so white her shoulders really beautiful the pen rolls across the desk do you know what he told me\nHe said he had a lot of time to think on the train that he felt like some invisible force was holding him back that it wasn't the right time and that was why it had snowed he said he wanted me to be patient to wait just a little longer just a little longer\nAnd then we screwed just like we always do that's all we have left\nI imagine her naked the doctors fingers running over her skin her hair the wet places I picture her tongue licking the edge of the blue envelope who wouldn't want her\nGastrointestinal med too long up demolish the one short neurology one long pediatrics for short to pick up the pace trying to distract her but she's not paying attention anymore depends still on the desk\nHow could he be so cruel how could you tell me to wait no I couldn't wait any longer not one more day not one more second I take it\nRegister and begin checking the coats myself trying to be as needed she is\nThat's why I killed him she says her voice is low and cold\nI feel a scream rising out of me but somehow I stop it hold it back", "show_name": "Southern Remedy", "year": "2018", "city": "Jackson", "day": "28"}
