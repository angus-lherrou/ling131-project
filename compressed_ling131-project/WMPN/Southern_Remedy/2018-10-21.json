all animals\nMingling fear in high spirits unless you hurry to in pushing my paper rose into this leaving her blouse\nI sat there the whole services time eyes fixed on the higher realms again I Can't really say what I saw through that screen but I Believe I found her and the diamond of a lot is\nI Believe that the prayer book she held before her face hit the OED on melancholy\nI Believe that when she looked\nUp from the book and down into the congregation or eyes were searching for mine and that she found them gazing up among the 'bout heads\nAnd that she looked right at me\nAnd I believe she was crying\nHad a fever was hotter than ever and my mind felt stuck asked melted and struggling to move it would take me an hour to get through pages on the genealogy of morals\nThen I fall asleep
