cities cities were supposed to die out\nThe proliferation of the automobile and everyone would move to the suburbs and never come back the decline of urban manufacturing and the city itself would decline and then there's all the crime\nEver want to live in any city as it turns out just about everyone we're in the middle of an historic holy ... predicted rise\n... happening here in America in all over the world one problem many of our cities are old means they're not exactly optimized for the twenty first century and it's not so easy to retrofit an entire city so how about building a new city for the twenty first century n beyond from scratch\nOur mission is to use technology to really redefined urban life and the twenty first century\nToday on freakonomics radio a look at city of the future with a man who's been rebuilding New York city for the past few decades to men [noise] some people call a modern day Robert Moses the controversial mastered builder of decades past [noise] like I think if\nSomebody says it in meaning that they got a lot done um then I think it's a compliment I think if somebody says oh you did a lot of top down planning and you\nDisplace lots of people than it would be an insult it would also I think not be true [noise] along the way\nHe learned central paradox successful cities the question\nIs how do you actually manage supply and demand\nA conversation with the major league credentialed urban is Dan doctor off to see get comfortable that's what he did [noise]\nI Am sitting on leaning back and smoking a cigar [noise]\n\nIs freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything [noise] here's your house [noise] even now [noise]\n\nIf you happen to live in New York City is I Do there's a name it's been routinely popping up for a few decades now always attached to interesting and often controversial project shirt 'em Dan doctor off but don't worry if you haven't heard of doctor off he's not quite a household name but his fingerprints are all over the biggest city in the United states\nYou grow up in Michigan became a New Yorker quite reluctantly it just wasn't his kind of place but\nHe settled in in his wife started raising their family here he worked in investment banking and private equity seemingly just another money harvester from the provinces who finds the urban bridges too good to pass up this went on for years\nAnd along the way I came up with this crazy idea that New York hot to host the Olympics\nAnd a eventually that that idea became a bit of a movement it drew the attention of Mike Bloomberg with the time was just an ordinary billionaire and uh I don't think was even seriously thinking about running for mayor but he joined our board gave some money\nMichael Bloomberg wasn't seriously thinking about running for mayor much less being there\nWhich as you may know also describes the arc of our current president Donald Trump's run for president apparently started out as a means of enlarging the Trump brand Bloomberg's run for mayor of New York city was apparently his way enlarging Bloomberg LP the financial information company that made him rich\nBut voters well voters are funny animals Bloomberg while short on charm at a certain appeal smart self made fiercely pragmatic and he spoke his mind often to the detriment of the people he was speaking about\nThen the twin towers were obliterated in the September eleventh terrorist attack less than two months later Mike Bloomberg was elected New York's one hundred and ... mayor\nNow Bloomberg a political neophyte facing a recovery of unknown dimensions invited some other news sites to help\nAnd when he unexpectedly one right after nine eleven or he asked me to join him in city hall and so I became deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding\nDamn doctor off did that job for six years\nHe then asked me to go run his company which I did for seven years Bloomberg LP\nAnd Bloomberg was finally done being mayor in two thousand Thirteen after squeezing out a third term spite preexisting two term limit he considered running for president you considered some other things too but then to the surprise of many he went back to Bloomberg LP\nAnd when he decided he wanted to come back to the company I laughed and do all of a tremendous relationship with him but decided I just didn't wanna go back to being his deputy mayor anymore and formed a company with Google or called sidewalk labs\nAnd that's where a doctor off can be found today a CEO of sidewalk labs whose mission is\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century and we want to do it by literally building or a city or a district of a city and we have chosen Toronto to do that\nOkay let's back up to before the un doctor off was a new one [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursue do you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed and then um ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level\nKind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York perhaps benefited more from the bid for the Olympics and all the infrastructure and related benefits that have produced then that would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they use the deadlines of the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it you know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for ...\nYou are leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite a science of what kind of region will benefit from it all\nDepends on the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle\nHaving that kind of catalyst could be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive reads zoning done in time et cetera et cetera\nNow the second question you asked was or we better off having now one and there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff done for\n... subway today if we continent\nWell right now I think that might have had a real impact right we could have argued look all these people are coming I think it could have been the deadline to getting for example congestion pricing done but at the end of the day you know much of what we wanted to do as part of the Olympic plan and that was ... developing the waterfront\nYou know in Brooklyn or queens or the whole west side of Manhattan or the high line or regeneration in Coney Island in Harlem and flushing\nAreas that have been largely ignored for a long period of time got a big boost from the fact that we bid for the Olympics\nI Love you to give me Dan in just a minute or two what you would consider the best accomplishments of the Bloomberg administration\nWell in my area I think we fundamentally redefined the economy and land use of New York\nOur stories are not the end of the conversation\nTo public radio we are of a public radio\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDamn doctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York\nThen joined the Bloomberg administration helped New York recover from the nine eleven attack\nWho then paired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today one of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off is chairman of president\nShed I'm just curious about the the why ... why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts fiend at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back\nTo when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea and the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to uh build what's called Hudson Yards which is this area on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution\nWe set to standards for one it should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard because there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York and\nSecondly that it should play a role in keeping New York on the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing and reshaping the cultural ecosystem that led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible both pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer or something else\nThat's exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the building literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather the shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of the big city like New York\nThat's a great way of saying you know another way of expressing as say cultural festival every day because there's multiple spaces that can be recon figured\nThat can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends begin to change I think that is a very different notion of the cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero distrust\nPeople to New York city these days outsiders visitors the high line is among the most popular it was proposed to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me that\nYou and your folks around you who were obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble as the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which should proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee I\nWill confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that what we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because\nYou know in some dimensions I'd imagine the competition is healthy right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivized firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nView was that financial incentives uh to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been to bribe companies to stay or abroad companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures in great detail\nCompanies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world you know sort of this optimistic sense that produced this incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that most places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know you know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change the city's personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\nRoom\nCities unlike people reading companies can be as we noted earlier difficult\nDirector ... not just physically all those buildings that transportation and energy infrastructure but also psychic clean culturally economically ... which is why doctors concluded would be really interesting to start city from scratch two dozen Fifteen\nHe teamed up with Google to create a company called sidewalk labs\nAnd our mission is to really help to redefine urban life or in the twenty first century combining cutting edge innovation with great urban planning\nThese companies is super large platform or not\nThey have developed the capacity to manipulate us to control us to control the information that is delivered to control the pricing which products are delivered to us to control us as producers\nThe gas companies are far bigger richer and arguably more dominant than tech companies in the past\nGoogle for instance has Ninety percent of global search engine market share Facebook has more than ... billion monthly active users Amazon has an estimated Ninety five million prime members in the U. S. that something like Seventy five percent of all American households\nIt's estimated that almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon\nThis kind of scale creates a lot of concern we've examined this concern in previous episodes like who runs the Internet and use the Internet being ruined\nWe're seeing the birth of new center of power real power we depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful and fascinating but they're making significant decisions you know laterally\nThere's also the question of whether the mission of these firms is as socially beneficial as many people believed they were in the early days the Internet there's old is really smart\nEngineers there the brightest computer scientists and all they're thinking about is how do I keep someone on Facebook for ten more minutes plus the exact combination of things that will keep them stay on the site as long as possible so that we can show them as much advertisement as\nPossible so here's a question if you are one of those huge dominant super wealthy firms what would you do to ensure that the good times steak [noise]\nProbably spend a lot of money lobbying politicians which yes they do it's been a huge ramping up lately and lobbying by ... [noise] but you might\nAlso do something a bit subtler story today begins with a journalist [noise]\nUm Franklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books or talk about that for just a minute and the family that produced all of you\nRight so I have two brothers Johnathan he's written a good number of novels including everything is limited and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a a science writer who wrote a book called moon walking\nWith Einstein and it's actually incredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because uh\nI'm sure it would in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being\nThree brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but I you know our parents didn't do anything\nThey didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day or or a sit down and study the great chess masters [laughter] we watched a lot of ... he man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up but what are the things that they ...\nThey said we weren't allowed to stand essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card that will at the book shop and so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was slate one of the very first mainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft and so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nThere was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence of the Internet this idea that we were going to tie the world together I Love search engines I Love the fact that I can access every book in human history\nAnd an ... and I love that I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things arguably make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life much better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention they ... the ... and the iPhone were incredible innovations and so I think we were right to marvel at them\nSo after rating for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic or as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nSo the New Republic with this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist Oregon and managed to persist over a hundred years we'll never really turning a profit and so as\nWe entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing\nTo continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up resigning his editor\nBut then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris used who'd been mark soccer birds roommate at Harvard and co founder of Facebook and he bought the magazine and\nTo me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media\nWho had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back and I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship and the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good\nYeah we became really good friends and it was exhilarating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and then maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris decided that\nHe'd always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it and so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand Thirteen ... way to get clicks was to post a clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and you slap the headline on it and you may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine and if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school to suddenly find yourself producing things that are extremely popular\nYou become obsessed with replicating that popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to\nThis new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job was offering other people jobs at the New Republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nYeah that's completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\n[noise] the recent history of the Internet at least over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet it shifted the same guy who used to think this\nThere was a certain amount of utopian ism associated with the emergence of the Internet and this I Love search engines and this these technologies were incredible Amazon is an incredible company has now come\nTo think this Amazon thinks of itself as the everything store\nAnd it's gotten itself in a pretty much every conceivable business it owns whole foods it powers the cloud or it has this data for the CIA and so on and so on and there's really nothing that it doesn't try to squeeze into its empire he also thinks this\nAs Facebook shapes the way that we consume news as Google shapes the way that we interact with information and\nThere's Amazon has shaped the way that we interact with books\nThe dominance that these companies exert ends up trickling through the cultural intellectual ecosystem and with Amazon my concern is that the book business has become utterly dependent on them that they hold one of the future of monopoly is in the world\n[noise] actually it's not quite true my name is not I teach at Princeton one course she teaches the economics of Internet\nThe existence of a monopoly of a single so I mean any product space unless it's a government granted monopoly is rare in the digital economy so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
