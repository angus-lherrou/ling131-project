casual fan and you follow just a couple of sports teams or maybe you pay no attention to sports and you only see it when the Olympics are on somebody else's TV whichever the case when you do see those athletes it's easy to think of them as existing solely in that context\nAs a full grown adult wearing a uniform performing under extraordinary pressure focused on highly specialized task that has zero to do with daily life or at least your daily life but is that who those people really are and how they get so good at this thing they do\nWe see them on TV all you're seeing is the outcome but what were the input we understand that elite athletes represents some magical combination of talent and determination but what about said luck and my gosh uh\nI I yes absolutely I think like a ton of luck involved\nBut Shawn Johnson in American gymnast to one unlimited gold medal and many other top honors\nAnd like this miracle math equation has said equal the perfect answer I mean you can't get hurt

people so I guess I was just the best of the very few that equation and today on\nFreakonomics radio the third installment in the series we're calling the hidden side of sports in the first episode we looked at how sports have always mirrored society from our historical penchant for war and colonizing two or more recent obsession with pushing the limits of human achievement\n\nIn episode two we looked at the economics of a single NFL franchise to San Francisco forty niners and how they have a gun to recover from a debilitating losing streak\nI Know when you lose a game a lot of noise happens when you lose to a town happens usually trees like Armageddon I'm\nTrying not in today's episode becoming an athlete time to step back and try to understand how these people rose to such heightened scientific is the process of predictable will look at a number of factors including of course raw talent my parents are both superstar athletes\nWill look at will determination I did a bunch of push ups and sit ups that night into our was I'm throwing up and the mental aspect of this most physical pursuit to\nWell I think the mind is is as big of a separate or um for professional athletes as any physical tools will hear stories of opportunities gained\nAnd lost in Nineteen eighty one it was Eighteen forty seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent and we'll hear one story it's almost too good to be true\nThey said hey you are blowing up on Twitter you're going to grab you know your everywhere and you just have no idea\n\n\nIs freakonomics radio show that explores the inside of everything here's your house even that\nFormer in any field sports or music or surgery whatever it's natural to ask yourself the question how they get so that's how much of that ability where they born how much is attributable to hard work can practice and this is a debate been going on probably forever nature versus nurture\nRaw talent versus what's it called deliberate practice\nWe've had that debate on this program most recently in episode called how to become a great and just about anything too often this debate ends up obscuring what strikes me as a pretty obvious things and become great at anything need both talent in lots of each but\nEven that fact seems pretty narrow don't you think because\nAthletic success like any success and leave money failure it's what you might call multi factorial\nA lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to athletes with identical talent levels in identical training methods you really want to make a big bet that their athletic careers also end up identical\nAs much as we might want to turn the pursuit of success in to science into a recipe real life is more nuanced and then also more interesting so I mean [noise]\nJay Z\nSold drugs grew up in a Marcy projects to a single mother\nThat's Dominique Fox worth who played six seasons in the NFL\nNow he is I\nMultiply multimillionaire married to beyond say the most amazing talent we have today so why don't we set it up so that all young men must sell drugs when barricades and um and have only their mother and grow up in\nA Marcy projects in Brooklyn New York like I I mean she had a great\nTalent and to be honest like there's probably a a great deal of law like he happened to not be there when one of his friends got arrested and his friend in snitch on them like that is like a lot of luck\nAnd that to me and I think the same thing is true for me like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen that were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be\nThere should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems crazy\nSo okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprised to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early age ... to share a for instance a three time major league baseball all star\nYes you know ... and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athletes are going to be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always ... uh and I actually enjoy playing basketball more uh I play backyard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport for my future\nAthletic talent is considered one of the more heritable traits passed from parent to child\nIn super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families\nThe Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports like from day one I think from birth and my parents are both super suddenly athletes they both come from very athletic family my parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shifting who's one two and then the gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and next surgeries and everything but she still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up and the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson he was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he a race ... 'cause I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas\nDonald or is about six to um lean a\n... guy\nThomas played basketball at a small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player in the college program was far from ... one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump\nAnd the best jumper on the track team guy named Carlos overheard him and said you know you're talking all that trash um you wouldn't even clear bar a six foot six and real competition and and Donald says yes yes I Would\nSo they go out to the track and Carlos sets the high jump bar at sixty six inches Donald still wearing his basketball sneakers runs up jumps clears easily Carlos move the bar higher and higher Donald keeps clearing it\nAbout one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those top ten schools any so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it and I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think\nIs you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that you might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and and the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools\nThat have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those\nTen have a fencing the the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill there's three different blade says ... soil and there's male female fancy and given that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers so it's something like\nSix or seven percent of the kids who ever tried to be sensors ended up being college fences about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent be fine\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else cuts and something like Fifteen fold we should say here that college admissions being what they are\nFencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would still need to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener\nHow does lead but think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to an Ivy League school forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like\nThree hundred thousand kids playing high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer be your vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing\nTurns out to be about Seventy five or ... times harder so how many of your kids have you turned to defense or is it\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old\nAnd he fences that are really good club in Chicago and I don't know his grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing [noise]\nComing up on freakonomics radio the story of an athlete who did go to an Ivy League school but then when it's time to go pro that apparently counted against him if he had played at Kentucky or\nDo you view would have been a time to come and drive\nThe problem was he played at Harvard we'll be right

afternoon at Ford right after the splendid\nTable on Rhode Island public radio [laughter]\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ... ...\nSays we've been hearing there are a lot of input to go into the production of an elite athlete Palin's drive the right kind of practice may be a parent or to to get you to the rings the gym or the track five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence my coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese\nAnd when he was three years old he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he'll kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson that started her training at the different to them and I loved it it was awesome but\nChild my coach that took me to ... opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was really really blessed to fall under his his guidance and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have\nVery loving very very protective people around me and he I mean given today's society I can thankfully and\nSay that he he kept me safe and I am forever grateful for that\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities\nWhich she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether if you're bad luck bore through something much more concrete like lack of money over the past decade youth sports economy has doubled more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involves some sort\nIs something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about ...\nTrue true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this weekend the next week and you go to Nevada and after that it's Texas and I don't understand how to work from parents could ever afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics the last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near that all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play um\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to pay for itself out as some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one or the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nSo I look at these factors the industrialization\nMass incarceration as suburbanization so at the industrialization lack of tax base we know there's no funds to what construct and maintain balls feels\nSo you see the rapid decline of the physical space in the Bronx in Chicago in these other uh urban areas which leads to a lack of participation\nThat again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm though that that core slows going to make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and\nBlah blah blah blah so I was like no not going to do that so instead\nYou did was it American studies yeah and that American studies were in journalism ... which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football [laughter]\nNo I um I enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready for football and I\nSay all that to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you give it up through the course of your life [noise]\n\nYou shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or he played long enough to enter free agency his final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now out of football for a few years he's still feeling the after effects\nOf his single minded and\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid at a very clear goal and I work towards that goal and I made lots of decisions that would give me closer to that goal but give me further away from other important and interesting things including friends including family and\nAnd then I was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting\nI think it's a feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like alone obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been\nAlmost ... focused on a goal which being focused on that goal I gave me purpose and I'm sure I'm going to butcher the nature the quote but it's something to the effect of\nA when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow and like\nI was I didn't I don't drink now I never drank in my life I never smoke we like I\nWas single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I ... the people I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends friends that she's been close with since they were in the second grade and like and I'm like\nI don't really have that and like I was making these choices\nAh which I thought were choices to get me what you wanted right and I didn't realize at the time that I was for going like lasting long lasting relationship\nComing up after the break what does it set you back if you pursue the athletic dream and don't make it the person who\nPlays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game

sacrifices all the opportunities for gun translate into a successful athletic career as it did for Dominique Fox worth and mark to share a and Lauren Murphy but what about the athletes\nWho make the sacrifices but don't make the big time\nJust looking at numbers they're only about Seventeen hundred players in the NFL major league baseball you're fewer than nine hundred the NBA just about five hundred in baseball roughly Ninety percent of the players drafted by major league clubs don't ever make it to the majors\nOne of those Ninety percent was just in Humphries\nYou get a phone calls those how's it feel to be the next member of the Houston Astros and you just get you get it it's a dream come true so I ended up signing\nHe started playing minor league baseball at Eighteen which meant skipping college although he did start taking some courses later on\nIn two thousand nine he retired at age twenty seven without ever making the majors he enrolled at Columbia University and took a sociology class with a professor named Sudhir Venkatesh\nSo I was sitting there in his classroom I started thinking about all the issues are that I've seen an independent baseball and affiliated baseball guys living check to check struggling with Louis go back to school family life issues at home\nAnd I thought if I could use some of the things that we were learning in class talked to some of these guys and find out whether the stories and and things that I was seeing and hearing was reflected in the numbers\nWe followed a sample of the draft class of two thousand and one and so that's a but you know it's ten years and that is Sudhir Venkatesh and so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks I think one of the the the most curious things that we've\nTwo people who grow up in the same circumstances let's say one played baseball in one didn't the person who plays baseball is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they enter the game then the person who decides not to play baseball and it was just one of the regular career\nAll right so what kind of background is typical for these players you're tracking the average player\nProbably looks like an upper middle class kids who comes out of college or comes out of high school\nUm and when you follow in upper middle class kid for about seven to ten years they're probably gonna make higher than the median average income they're probably going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe they are going to have a career now when you take the counterpart among the pool that was drafted that median kid\nThat kid looks like he's making about twenty to twenty four thousand dollars a year\nWhich is not a lot of money um he's working probably five to seven months playing baseball and then struggling to find part time work in the off season might be coaching might be doing some training might be working on a construction site might be working in fast food\nWell when you're twenty five playing an independent ball making less than two thousand dollars a month\nLiving off your parents because you can't financially sustain yourself like that\nAt some point you have to say look I got with no degree I had a lesson associates degree at that point so at some point you tell yourself I Can't do this to myself I Can't do this to my parents and I can't continue when I Know there's ... untapped potential to do other things [laughter]\nKnowing when to quit anything is hard especially if it means abandoning a lifelong dream\nQuitting an athletic dream is especially hard because big into the ethos that sport is the idea that you should never quit never give up never backed down\nI think about it if you had been playing in the minor leagues or some equivalent for a decade\nWhen you really think your moment was ever going to come you really think there was any chance at all before you answer I'd like to introduce you to someone named Andre Ingram\nHey how you doing man sorry I'm late [laughter]\nNo no no no worries let's talk a little bit about your background or I Believe he grew up in Richmond, Virginia where are you still live is that right that's correct I'm curious as your family the same income family of the gospel group the anger\nMet her best very good yeah that's exactly correct um that's where my father's side\nAnd then tell me about you do are you a musical or you talented\nNow my so my brother and uh the athletes and ah it's funny because everyone else in our family as musically gifted in some way my brother and I we got none of that so yeah we just we got the athletics [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Freakonomics Radio", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
