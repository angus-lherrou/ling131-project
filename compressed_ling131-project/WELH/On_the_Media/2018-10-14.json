of a sudden we have this kind of new thing people a lot of people living in a place altogether\nNeeding some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of

medium of extreme\nOnly problem is says now we're no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence of simple barter anywhere\nIn history yeah so\nThe ... story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story\nFor money and kind of set it forth into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the Danny people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing as part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over death over the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case\nIsn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this context some\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pick that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that's value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how did this barter mythology or become so nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today\nAnd that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's\nSo it's great to justify current conditions but when you start kind of\nCracking it open and starts at appealing back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting and a lot more complicated and involved things like recordkeeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well then you're in a whole other realm\nThe real story is told in Mesopotamia tablets and other artifacts record keeping dating from the rise of agriculture and settled communities in the ancient Near East phenomena that demanded the invention of\nBook keeping we're dealing now with people who aren't just hunting and gathering but are growing grain\nAnd are taking care of animals like sheep and goats these commodities have seasonal cycles I plant the grain and it takes a while to turn into stuff that I can read and turned into you know do and bread and sheep and goats only Cav during certain parts of the year\nYou know if I'm planting grain and I'm going to give some to you after a period of time and you're raising goats and you're going to give some to me after a period of time we both have the built in season ...\nAnd what we start to see in those situations is the emergence of central authorities\nCentral clearing houses which had some properties of temples absorb spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other that say things like okay look you're giving me this go today thank you after a certain period of time after six months I Will\nRepay that debt that I now [noise] with certain number of bushels of [noise] okay that is from the fertile crescent three millennia ago it's from a different temp to Chicago Board\nOf trade soybean trading floor from two thousand and six [noise] but you get the idea and in both cases every promise was recorded\nWe have scribes in these temples keep track of these contracts and that's where we start to see something like money\nThat kind of a time deferred contract for the

tablets\nAnd others slightly less portable media\nTravel as the New York times retro reported to the tiny my finish in Ireland yeah loads of money the science of semi truck we'll made of stone [noise]\nAre thousands of these towns all\nThey're actually an ancient form of currency who's value resides partly in scarcity stones had to be imported in canoes from neighboring islands partly in

movies rice towns around her exchange them by students can get to be pretty massive the largest is about four times and twelve feet across\nYou can't feed the meter with them or melt them down or wire

shorthand of coin and currency and further to banking transactions and credit instruments and so on to the ... as we shall soon discuss of digital currency\nDusted money emerge not from the barter
