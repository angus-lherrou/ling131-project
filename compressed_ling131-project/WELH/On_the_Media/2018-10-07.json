fallacies she's seen lately like the anti bandwagon fallacy\nTo anti bandwagon fallacy it's something that kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news items treated content

so the question is if there was something ... going on was or hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that to be a bandwagon that invalidated the

offender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to carrying every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate

dance was a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nWas

what most Americans know about the mosque car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen language has never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization if the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee Dudley dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did and he was a low point we had withstood costs assaults and our sovereignty or cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realize and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist well then you have to write it and that's exactly what I tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians in to the national spotlight the declared at Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with a Caucasian and having this this land nearby all for the following three to real purchased said delta ... for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar island about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doom from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nJust as we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and and they and they searched me\nDon't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but are continuing\nAttention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kinds of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present to the government\nThey wanted the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timber and mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't cops to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys back man even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat's right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time the currents that we have to live virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed the\nKinds of violence or you might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge\nAnd in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\n[noise] hot\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it I\nAm activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German of Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military build up everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom were not native hostage\nAnd then later the hostage just had we refer you to go to any time we just didn't want\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better\nSo [noise] in my mind it's a story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show David Dreier isn't a chip away from the leech lake reservation in

colonial disregard\nThe question of who should claims solidarity with this minority seems straightforward enough but perhaps not because of Germany's racist far right party alternative for Germany claims kinship with the plight of Native Americans\nGerman historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across Indian imagery and an alternative for Germany NewME biking to pass and fortunately I found it\nHilarious at first it was in a tweet by one of the local branches of a sudden ... the alternative for Germany\nThe tweet showed the photograph of sitting bull it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation and election campaigns of many European right wing party Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you'll find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon\nIndian food the ...\nAnd you say that India and the thing is the ads and and German nationalism actually shares similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's work deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either\nMilitary occupation or had been forced to become allies off Napoleon so nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation myth\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources describe these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as they could have done and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones or who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament what's akin to that of the noble Savage\nCentered around notions off resist\nTune to nature the forest was sacred homeland which throughout the nineteenth century became a root off of blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nThat's right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and his Apache friend written into the farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter]\nWay after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shot her hand on himself so named because he could not his fall is out with one explosive punch exactly Apache Chief and then to see to me the really popular actor among the German public right\nYes he is in an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter] she's always out there by himself looking for white people he can help\nAnd Carl my made him exotic enough to fit into the frame of the adventure\nBut as some scholars described it to you also seems to be a very good German [laughter] because he has his character trait that their German bourgeoisie or supposed to strive towards like on the\nBravery industry is nests\nThese novels had a very long life was Hitler\nYes it is that that ... late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand vena two novels to the troops\nBecause he said reading about being a too will help German officers you with your ... warfare on the Eastern Front that venue to what the ideal company commander but he wasn't why\n[laughter] there were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and heroes\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also fragments just said it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German India enthusiasm why not harness it and profit from it\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym fits ... said presenting Indian novels to German children teaches them about leadership
