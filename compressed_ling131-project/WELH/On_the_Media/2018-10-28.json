speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nGigantic population of truckers which so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with a guy named Bartolone Fuentes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell see I think at that time I started in the second stage that\nAccording to have our fellow and I'm not going to but it's getting from that there were other people with much smaller care that he saw information about it are safe and if I can get in touch with those organizers\nHe has a life experience and facilitate it all in a show and so\nHe got in touch with them verified it and then he said the post on faith up according to tell us what happened was there isn't any change it they ... people and then there is news report on hunter isn't this watch cable news network called ...\nComing up though I was going to see when I got to be identified the leader that my box on a Wednesday and then when I look\nIn and they are clearly said that he would be paying for food and other costs are people\nThat are ... you know they might not want to know how you are\nAnd he said yeah he got tons and tons and tons of cause\nBut you know I don't think that's sort of the explanation I think it helped start things and get them going but then all of the other factor why people like ... has about in the way that it had and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people\nBut he definitely credits that positive news or part with the initial explosion\nOn a report from HGH here is what ... told you and I'm I'm reading from your story in Honduras the government wants to minimize why people are leaving they know they're going to leave\n... and the opposition not the conditions that they are just the government created this is in line with with the United states is saying that there are false promises being made and this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people are really just need to get out\nThere is this right wing media me\nIt's actually video of service members\nBeing paid cash money\nHas the story is told that it's you know George Soros money or Democratic Party money bribing people had northward to invade a\nCaravan they liked the garbage a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan but that has been debunked touch wood not\nYeah absolutely there's been multiple fact checks on it for say on a busy owned by the New York times like there's absolutely nothing to back up that

immediately tweeted it out and there are ... called fire so this is not only mid term politics playing out\nIts Honduran domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plant that false explanation\nThat explanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period by the state affairs the closest thing to the investor to the United states has around Hungarian is is that it's funded by the opposition of hunger and that is sort of a political game that people within\nThe country are playing that sort of more than wine that I've been seeing

three right after snap judgment on the public radio eighty nine point three of them\nThis is on the media I'm Bob Garfield an election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three a yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals' against discrimination in public spaces a no\nSixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWhen does not\nAnd woman can enter a woman can block\nStanding down time when the man\n[noise] it's almost comical a anti trans video but in a remarkable exercise in political hold me up at the the activists on the other side of the question many themselves trends went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trans related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nWere able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's the effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients to a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys\nThree days three weeks six weeks and three months later\nIs that when we compare the group that we had a conversation with at the door versus the group we could have that did not that treatment group is significantly more accepting of transgender people across a variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is that if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing\nOne thing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those a trance phobic advertisements to say well if we showed them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive more over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... now does your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy of the matter of\nIt's really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine move from putting leeches on people and tell me anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the the last word on the matter it's much more like one of the first words on the matter this particular kind of intervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to a number of volunteers who have to fan out in the community\nWhich is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies\nHold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns the Bernie Sanders' campaign in twenty sixteen the ... campaign right now in Texas and many others\nWho have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really\nThink about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy that normative leap might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or to do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team but you need is a candidate or a cause\nThat many kinds of engaged individuals want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election results that's kind of the traps that that research on campaigns and elections and campaign consultant has been for a hundred years we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nYesterday had done something else which of course we can't do because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYeah but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries that as new ideas and innovations come out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think that campaigns will or even necessarily should\nBe taking this one study we have and you know reorientate all their activities around it within the next year I Hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that\nIs very persuasive and rigorous and the prejudice reduction advocates will be interested in applying in their work\nThere but thank you so much ... thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist at the
