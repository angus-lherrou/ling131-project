consequences for hurting women that to me too movement strides to apply\nFor last November she explained several of the logical fallacies used by the culture to excuse or ignore bad behavior we called on her again to identify the new fallacies she's seen lately like the anti bandwagon fallacy\n[laughter] the anti bandwagon fallacy it's something that kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a news items trees content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerged we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were memory faces and my wife especially against one\nSo the question is if there was something ... going on was or hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah when more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that to be a bandwagon that invalidated the initial accusation something else that I heard recently is that ... effect or technique which is a way that a lot of people who are accused respond\n... stands for deny attack and reverse victim an offender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to train every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him we certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we\nFind male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation and loading powerfully that tends to us just scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of emotion we saw his Rogers and been married for your show by his tears and if you're not a doctor for rubber on this on for confirmation process which frankly is ...\nAnd I thought in the aftermath of the hearing a surprising number of pundits describing both his testimony in her as as equally credible which I found astonishing but once again we tend to find anger especially when it comes from a man to be somehow corroborating it's one of the things that we are\nIf we do all these things but then we will be reunited with our loved ones that our ancestors in the after world give us almost Protestant and it's\nAnd it's insistence on a kind of work ethic as it spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought if they did the dancers in the right way and for the right shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe meaning all the white\nPeople meaning the white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folks at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted Alex Band sue as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men women and children\n[noise] the descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a semblance of an Indian\nAnd then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pie in the air he said having wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization follow\nIt up with one more wrong and white please I'm paying ... and I'm came up all creatures from the face of the earth\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us and indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything that had come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the mosque car they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic vary by hard one to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen language has never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars and the end of the massacre wounded knee where the culture and civilization if the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty in the hopelessness and the squalor I Hope I\nYou sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee doubly dismaying you put it is because your reservation the leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that deep around despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we're we're not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live\nFully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms Toni Morrison once said that if this is a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared at Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be ... and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this was land nearby off of the following three real purchase ... for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of doom from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nThis is we got down there the whole the whole courtyard was covered with a FBI agents right they all had rifles and shotguns and they and they searched me\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nThe curve and was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWas it really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present to the government they wanted to be urban inner fares to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternal ...\nBillions of dollars of native money that he was holding and trust that were the result of grazing in timber and mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't talked to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank ...\nOne of Nixon's guys back man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to join the caravan\nAnd then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice\nThat is right in Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time this current that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] times come violence who might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile\nMurders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded me was under siege\n[noise]\nHot\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it\nI did aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people that travel government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German of Pine Ridge was interested mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military buildup everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of them were not native hostage\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really speaking out to be on the show David Dreier is a chip away from the leech lake reservation in Minnesota he's a professor of literature at the University

this minorities seems straightforward enough but perhaps not because of Germany's racists far right party alternative for Germany claims kinship with the plight of Native Americans\nGerman historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across Indian imagery and an alternative for Germany moon biking to pass and fortunately\nI found it hilarious at first\nIt was in a tweet by one of the local branches of ... the alternative for Germany their tweet showed the photograph of sitting bull it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party mhm Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon Indian food the ...\nAnd you say that India and the things he adds them and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nThey go hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German meaning states were either under military occupation or had been forced to become allies of Napoleon\nSo nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation myth\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that ... one of the very few sources describe these tribes as honest loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as they could and I'm over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen some early Nineteen century French philosophers Jones who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament was akin to that of the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off resistance freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the late Nineteen century there was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond\nEverything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters the German immigrant and adventure old had her hand and

to fit into the frame of the adventure\nBut as some scholars described it to you also seems to be a very good German [laughter] because he has his character trait that their German border was the
