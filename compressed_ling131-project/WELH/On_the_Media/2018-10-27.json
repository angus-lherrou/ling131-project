immediately retreated to blaming the biggest culprits\nWhat is the first statement the president makes about this today is to attack the media he says a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purpose next fall and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that Africa was fake news\nHas gotten so bad and hateful that beyond description mainstream media must clean

Donald Trump but the desperate reaction to ongoing crisis in Honduras Sarah welcome to in the media\nThank you for having not until the last couple of days we're speaking on Thursday Afternoon it was kind of mysterious how this\nDrug in the population of truckers which so quickly coalesce but we now know more and it begins I guess with a guy named Bartolone Fuentes a leftist former politician in Honduras what was his role in all of this\nWell did he I think it started in the second stage that\nAccording to have our tell though and I have not been able to confirm that there were other people with much smaller care that he saw intonation about it are the stuff and if I can get in touch with those organizers\nHe has a life experience and facilitate all in a ... um and so\nHe got in touch with them verified it and then he said the post on the stuff according to tell us what happened was there isn't any change it they ... people and then there is news report on hunters watch cable news network called ... which\nIs coming up though I was going to see when I got rid of identified\nHim as a reader them up on a Wednesday and then when I look in and they are clearly said that he would be paying for food and other costs are people\nThat are not going to me that you know there might be and I found in Iraq\nAnd he said he got tons and tons and tons of cause\nBut you know I don't think that's sort of the explanation I think it helped start things and get them ... but then all of the other factor why people like ... has about in the way that it has and that doesn't take away from the fact that this is an extraordinary amount of people\nBut he definitely credits that positive news or part with the initial explosion\nOn the report from HGH here is what ... told you and I'm I'm reading from your story in Honduras the government wants to minimize what people are leaving they know\nThey're going to leave and they want to say that they're doing so because of lives and the opposition not the conditions that day that is the government created\nThis is in line with what the United States is saying\nThat there are false promises being made and this pro government news program played into that messaging trying to say that there is financing when people really just need to get out\nThere is this right wing media me it's actually\nVideo of German members\nBeing paid cash money\nHas the story is told that it's you know George Soros money or Democratic Party money bribing people had northward to invade our borders\nOn caravans they liked the caravan it's a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan but that has been debunked tested not\n... than multiple fact checked on it or stay on the on by the New York times they had there's absolutely nothing to back up that George tourists as pets\nThat it was local businessmen and it was a very very small amount of money that was passed out to that and that's really not unusual considering the local support that we're seeing for migrants here in Mexico both in the town once people get there\nAnd then along the way they're single pass out water than at a close ally not one for me though yesterday and if I were the migrant settled people came out and we're giving us toys underwear and all these sorts of different necessities they're really saying a groundswell of local support for this care to\nKnow what's interesting about that Trump is that its origins seemed to be the hunter and the bus or to the United states\nWho sent the video footage to a Republican congressman who immediately tweeted it out and they're a punk caught fire so this is not only mid term politics playing out\nIts Honduran domestic politics why would it be in the Honduran government's interest to a plant that false explanation\nThat explanation I've seen mostly going around hunters and something that I've seen period by the state affairs\nThe closest thing to the ambassador to the United states has around hunter is is that it is funded by the opposition of hunter and that is sort of a political game that people within the country are playing\nThat sort of more the wine that I've been seeing raised in ... which makes it a country of extremely polarized and then they just had a political crisis last year\nThere was a razor thin election and the machines counting the votes shut down and when they came back on\nThe leader of the opponents slowly starting to slip away and the current President Juan Orlando Hernandez who had been the income that\nOne power and so critics allege that he stole the election and it said it through the country and try and rats thirty people died in that shuffle mostly killed by security forces to the country is kind of grown in polarization sense so you know this sort of seems that narrative a with a\nPresident that frankly facing acquitted legitimacy crisis\nNo no you have to go let me ask you one last question is there one story that you've encountered the kind of crystal ours is the situation the personal drama or the politics and the fear\nI mean ... you turn around and every person us has another story that really it just makes their claims credible I met somebody the other day who said that his son was killed by then the sun was fourteen he made a clean\nThe police and now he's playing for his life he's afraid to come for and you know with his

the media I'm Bob Garfield on election day Massachusetts citizens will weigh in on a referendum known as question three a yes vote preserves existing protections for trans individuals'\nAgainst discrimination in public spaces a no vote returns the state to it's pre twenty sixteen status quo in which transgender was not illegal a protected class\nThe messaging on the no side of question three has featured the sort of scare tactics you might expect in such a key battle within the American culture wars including this attack ad produced by the no on three campaign\nWith his message into classrooms dreaming here\nAs he is a woman can enter a woman's locker room\nDown on privacy and\nYou can find [noise] it's almost comical a anti trends video but in a remarkable exercise in political homey op uh see the activists on the other side it's a question many themselves trends went door to door to share that ad with potential voters\nIt was not a random tactic it emerged based on the work of Stanford professor David Brockman who a few years ago in Florida on another trans related ballot question began applying his research findings to super charge the age old political process of door to door canvassing\nBut just plain talking to the person who answers the door\nAnd a lot of people have skepticism about this kind of approach because they say well there's no way that you could knock on a stranger a store and get them to talk to you much less tell these kinds of stories but well we actually found in the research is that canvassers who had just gone through a simple morning training\nWere able to have conversations where the vast majority of voters who were home open the door how the conversation and told a story from their life so\nI think our fellow Americans are actually remarkably open to reflecting and thinking about their political views about these kinds of topics if they're approached in such a way from a friendly person who is open and wants to have that kind of conversation with them\nSo once you initiated the perspective having what's\nThe effect that person becomes suddenly more open to other ... groups like trends citizens\nJust like clinical trials for medicine where you'd randomly assign patients do a blood pressure pill or a sugar pill we did the same thing in this study where we randomly assigned voters to either get the kind of perspective taking intervention that I mentioned or a control group that got a door knocked about recycling what we find when we do a series of follow up surveys\nThree days three weeks six weeks and three months later is that when we compare the group that we had that conversation with at the door versus the group we could have but did not\nThat treatment group is significantly\nMore accepting of transgender people across the variety of items the average effect is on the order of\nAbout Fifteen percentage points if you had to put it in those terms another way to think about it is that if you look at the change on items that measure attitudes towards gay men and lesbians and the average attitudes in Nineteen Ninety eight and twenty twelve\nWe see a similar effect from these ten twenty minute conversations as we see in the public in general from Nineteen Ninety eight to twenty twelve so that's a really really big effect\nDoes this and knock you lay them against political advertising that engages in hateful hot button pressing one\nThing we actually did and one of the follow up surveys is actually show the voters in both the treatment and control groups one of those trends phobic advertisements to say well if we showed them these ads is the effect of the canvas going to say go away as everyone retreats into a transfer the corner\nAlthough we do find the ad has some immediate effects we still find a treatment group we campus is much more supportive\nMore over several weeks later it seems as though the effect of the ad has completely ... what we find time again is that the effects of those kinds of mass media advertisements are very ephemeral\n... know doesn't your research fly in the face of academic orthodoxy of the matter of campaigns very\nActually entering the really interesting period which is sort of like when medicine moved from putting leeches on people and telling anecdotes like well I put a leash on Mary and Mary's got better so\nYou should put a leash on yourself to where we are kind of still I Would say in the early days of using these rigorous real world randomized trials that revolutionized medicine so there's different versions of orthodoxy depending on who you subscribe to but my personal view is that we actually just know remarkably little about the real world impacts of this kind of campaign activity\nI don't think our study is going to be the last word on them\nIntervention but we're doing lots of follow of work on other issues like immigration abortion to kind of flesh out or understanding of this\nTV campaigns reach a lot a lot a lot of people and a door to door canvassing is limited to the number of volunteers who have to fan out in a community which is why the campaign industrial complex is built around\nTelevision advertising so let's just say the effects that you found in your studies\nHold true through subsequent studies and become the received wisdom of political campaigning there's still the problem of of seeing enough individual voters at their door steps to really have any effect\nThere actually are plenty of political campaigns that Bernie Sanders' campaign in twenty sixteen the beta or ... campaign right now in Texas and many others who have succeeded in recruiting just a huge number of volunteers to go talk to their neighbors and knock on doors so\nFrom my perspective if campaigns don't try and really think about the art and science of recruiting volunteers and building a team to talk to their neighbors then it's no surprise that if they don't make a good try at it they're not going to have much success\nAnd in terms of the dollars and cents of it I think it's also a vision of American democracy the normative leap might like a little better too you don't need a big campaign budget or do lots of fundraisers with rich donors to be able to bankroll a serious field team but you need is a candidate or a cause\nThat many kinds of engaged individuals' want to go volunteer their time to spread the word about\nIn two weeks' time will know how Massachusetts voted on question three will that tell us anything the definitive about inoculation\nIs there some way that we could find ourselves on sound or statistical flooding on the subject of inoculation or are we going to have to wait for still more peer reviewed social science to materialize\nI wouldn't really resist the temptation to generalize too much from any particular election result that's kind of the trap that the research on campaigns and elections and campaigns and something's been for a hundred years but we really would like to know is what would have happened in the campaign\nIf they had done something else which of course we can't know because the campaign only happened a particular way so that's why we need these kinds of rigorous clinical trials to randomly assigned voters or districts or whatever else to say we can actually see what happens when we do this and when we don't\nYet but just between you and me should I be like investing heavily in clipboard futures [laughter]\nWell I think what we tend to see in other industries is that as new ideas and innovations\nCome out of academia they diffused over time and relatively slowly into the real world so I don't know that I think the campaigns will or even necessarily should be taking this one study we have and never reorientate all their activities around it within the next year I Hope on the scale of ten or Twenty years we'll have built up the kind of evidence based that\nIs very persuasive and rigorous and prejudice reduction advocates will be interested in applying in their work\nThere but thank you so much ... thank you David Brock man it's a political scientist at the graduate business
