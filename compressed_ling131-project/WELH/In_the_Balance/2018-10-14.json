I came in thinking you know I'm a rational amount of science ... times degree I Know that there are these ... is is a real bearing on the real physical will but actually I ... in cuts have been with us do that either\nI learned you know what else to to send me some faces yesterday he did yeah so I think I mean I see princes a couple of them out of\nYour mom and your brother is a\nYeah I think\nAbout\n... ... yeah I just wonder if you know just to see\nHow comfortable which is like a lot on on us to come to which I think is similar to wishing able to somebody you know even if you're not going to be able to actually change their lives uh bring them something about just by thinking about it but would you want to it's so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to\nJust not do that you don't have to know what I keep thinking\nAbout ... it's very common ritual magic and this is a real emotional thing to do\nI'm your like allergic to changing something in your house to the ocean and during that\nThanks to Sophie page ... thanks to my easily inclined to produce the most for that to mean trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either\nBut it was a bit surprised by how strong my version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture so what's going on ... how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave\nAnd to Jane rises and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo whether these superstitious or true to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process sees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen\nWe are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not so even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being ... related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is\nThe way that he respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so it's a a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program on on those a bit of amusing about voodoo and um but producing a very cruel he brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was off default words like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with a bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of the lake now if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how uh\nModel can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates very quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition and the slower process\nCan then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintain that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two mental systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of ... on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep your ... or you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what do you go full\nYou should go for the two [laughter] no question you're rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't trade their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel oh\nWow that's a really high number and so what you're saying there is the kind of choice the between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and sometimes the rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that intuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not the rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it\nSo another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the ... so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition she this is going to be really positive I ... through a picture of a loved one\nThat's a big cost so I'd rather avoid does not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying at\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it as a possibility Jane rise in the\nAre listening to crowd sons on the b._b._c.
