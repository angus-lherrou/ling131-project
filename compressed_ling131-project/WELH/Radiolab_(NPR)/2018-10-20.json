I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship in the book the pressures that lead you to say no no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that didn't exist throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we might as well we've ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make you wanna yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young to middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook and [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is on a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there are you the organizer\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering I'm Stephanie newer\nAnd what what are you calling in the United states doesn't er\nIn as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nPhotos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n\nNow\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook and\nOne of the opening shots Facebook triggered hordes asking what would become a loud but do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs buck today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\nViolence against single muscle what we can say in what we can't say\nThat again but I'm just like ... what we can see and what we can see let me learn right kids are frustrated me on\nOn the Internet [noise]\n\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr sacrifice I got to give you some jak get laid prioritize or sensors beach\nRe congresswoman we don't even think about what we're doing a censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into the rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early to\nSeismic changes this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path and ice space dot com it's now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the navy\nMy space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with the big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things would come up onto their ... to Facebook and\nI'm like meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly\nLike a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate clinic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise]\nThat content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd every time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take a doubt and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard or what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all of this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have the breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it out until\n[laughter] rise up fight for the lights that rather than\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on social\nNetworking website is under fire for it and tell them the motives of women right leading their children down in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring and have the best thing is not I didn't\nHundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine New York times Washington\nPost so Internet users interesting Dr phil it was a media storm\nAnd eventually perhaps as a result of our group and our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the side but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define nudity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female gymnasts\nI thought I'm going\nYou questions that we\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nSo there's a lot of renting leave me happening\nA lot about the good work advice [laughter] Oregon so now I I started working\nI mean like you just came out of there [noise]\nI Know you're lying in fact\nMost people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] uh [noise] willing to do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather that that's the only find you know I just go straight I don't want to add up\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct are headed for about ... watch\nWind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want yeah\nI I signed up to monitor graphic images just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know the impact that that's going to have I I\nTell you got your so this guy I talked to she he got his first time\nAbout a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones [laughter]\nIgnored ...\nJust like just like just like a forty five ... says every day it was just ... and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nAll of this is like that where they um it's two ... two X. rated or\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things federal\nHas exploded into you know get squashed by attack to you know people ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl uh having sex with an eight year old boy and just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were there were specific like it is but I couldn't watch it was ... ... ... S C I was like okay I had to wear exploding like nope nope I have to walk away\nAnd I just have to I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's classic adjusted\nThe different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of this stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a door or terrorist propaganda\nOr they're getting better automate that they had the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nWow but a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they're having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter oh really there will be comedians there will be a joke to me is hey All right okay so we take a break and then come back and I think we should\n[noise] Hi this is Jenny calling from Lima radio lab to supported by transfer wise and online service that let people send and receive money internationally and their border Leslie countless customers hold and convert currencies anytime more transfer wise dot com and the\nShame African Dina Reagan lot interpreted by targeting preventing future at heart pod casting change makers project third time getting in communities nationwide future at high\nLevel on Apple's ... and found\n[noise]\nServing Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts this is the public's radio eighty nine point three than our funding comes from listeners like Deborah from Newport\nProviding patient care medical education in advance is research to promote better health for the people in Rhode Island and the surrounding communities brown physicians dot org\nAlso funded by the American mathematical society including Providence\nAnd online at A.

that you're you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing and it gives you the kids in the room might want to sit it out you know get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nAnd Carlin Rhonda Merrill aside but sorry washed up my aunt had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carla\nMonday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bomb [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston there [noise]\nYou have sort of dust begins to settle\nPeople are springing into action\nOr just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured fix them up rose him in a wheelchair\nAnd as they are pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud a there's a photographer there any snaps this [noise]\nAnd the photo shows the runner and the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who are his face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ...\nMeanwhile CBS feeding your studio on the other side of the country is fine for me I remember snippets of the day [noise] Facebook employees\nWere clustering around several desks staring at the computer screens watching the news right now\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of watching some of the coverage chili new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published on line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly when voters going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to do with it this image is reading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rule they'd written by its in this totally new context so they got their team together and sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ...\nShould they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however half the rooms says no the other people are saying this is newsworthy book\nEssentially this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which the media the receive\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that\nThis is important and yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how\nDo you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they\nCan pull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so I mean yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah ...\nAnd this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or\nYeah it is it now and news organizations strength parents\nThere let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs and this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when Dr bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products basically\nSucker burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this\nIs is here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible and can be executed as consistently as possible but if\nA subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy he'll give it'll give you know give you a great example of this or that having just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico\nAnd it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices\nHer head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years now and there'll be\nIs covering the drug war in doing so years back she noticed this strange phenomenon\nIt first caught my attention
