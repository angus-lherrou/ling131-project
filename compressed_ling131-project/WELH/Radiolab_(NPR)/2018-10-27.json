I'm rubber crow which uses radio lab and today\nWe have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin or he also seems to have gotten yeah\nIt it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSurgeon Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist from the newspaper guy for the post darn glimpse falls he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing like set up two times and went to ...\nThey you know woke up and about nine AM get campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent who\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some ropes basically he had he had to each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after you had the four people tied he went back\nTo the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue skiing\nBecause the other three kids are spread out to the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with boys get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing ... with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times and the cats\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBy the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and of a sudden they spotted than a killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and Cooley walked into the forest and nuts began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nThere was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods they eventually\nFind the man's car and they're able to run the license plate when it comes back with an ID A thirty seven year old Robert\nDarrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape here seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and\nStory was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked when you're all well one of the doors are short of our people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says a man has done what happened was Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about ...\nLead that he had stolen a car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August nine Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Hillary block spotted Darrow\nThese a freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and Guerra started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time I saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but but you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk and it's at this point\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this is a law professor Lisa ... is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm many Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert\nGirl um where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a\nBit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go for it like standing up for the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defended you're fighting the state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah bless your strong to taste your mo you need a forty five and a or to head the fear in the sky is dangers a love of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things one one\nA schoolteacher shelters his child he was sued the school and I talk to her mother but none of them will be ... and that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then ... for [noise]\nUm let's see some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped this court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ...\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise] took of\nDriving that lady friends car to try to lose and you too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here\nWhich may be as far as we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and the town supervisor of Mariah Tom ... father says it's a ... a road that goes to the minded or what is clear to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road to visit\nA trail of her own or you're just\nA very icy that day this year this used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in here so\nRight up there so here we are in our son do shoots rhythms trudging choose for is looking for [noise]\n\nYes but we're looking [noise]\nNone fools [noise]\nWell you see the air ... fair they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the shoe some blue\nSneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this sum bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your money back up very\n\nEventually algae found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued was a very\nLong struggle where the lawyers\nTried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just care we took her to know to keep your confidences over wire under the current rules\nWhich have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client is under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial\nBodily harm that will be the yet that can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if\nPeople are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of him or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of ... just tell\nOf course a smart I knew Mr hawk from going to lose his to the other daughter\nKnew him from church June\nOne seems to be and then I'm On a few big ... the parents of the family when you do you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now does she [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise] we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\n\nIt's worthy from Arlington, Texas radio a lot to support it in part by the Alfred P fun foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology and\nThe modern Ron more information about flying WWW dot ... dot O. R. G. [noise]\nThis is not to have been the amount of from the radio lab is supported by target preventing future they're part a buck got some change makers and the project their championing incoming to make some future at heart available on apple pie costs and whatever puff costs are found [noise]\nThird one and this is Albert in state College Pennsylvania radiolab is supported by progressive insurance providing tools designed health customers consider options for multiple insurers comparisons available at progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive that's progressive\nI'm\n\nServing Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts this is the public's radio eighty nine point ...\nComing up it's more of radiolab\nFollowed by freakonomics radio at two o'clock then it's the splendid table at three\n[noise]\nThis is the public radio\n[noise] I'm Stephen ... hosts of freakonomics radio every week freakonomics radio explores the hidden side of [noise] well [noise]\nEverything from the economics of sleep [noise] to when is the best time to Rob a bank to tune in next time on freakonomics radio [noise]\nThis afternoon that too right after radio lab on the public's radio\nEighty nine points three FM\nOkay hey I'm ... I'm I'm Rhonda I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it they were where they were stuck right they'd have to they knew this thing they knew the client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move\nWild so they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nThey take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get ... into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they're going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give it a little room and you're going to take a little well that's kind of gross oh\nHe's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client\nSo report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detective McCabe and the district attorney Armand\nWell gee search the briefcase because of the da and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nThe whole they're talking about Susan and only show like these are the two girls that we're most concerned about we think they're alive\nAnd they told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven as for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that I don't go was here or there was a lawyer to do this job a ... I was a good lawyer and\nA so art everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a dead bodies case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what a people\nTo a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely because professors can point to what they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can see in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n... or\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of\nPhone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay you're okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so it's sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nAre 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um that that that you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and dog\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and\nThat's that's all we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse\nAnd then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or ...\nSo when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact\nEven went so far is to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as just sitting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli a lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and that is why did they taught law schools\n[noise] so anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot\nOf sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later and skills I I get it and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't know I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of I'm sad sense I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\nWell [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree pass too much sleep ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had their jets that summer and he had a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just the year before and so to live\nAnd I'm sure the other two children had great future ahead of them too and\nIt's just a horrible tragedy\n\n\nSnow it's horrible to be in the position\n[noise] let me relieve whose daughter were one of the ... for protecting the person the cue justification you couldn't just to my mind\nExpects them but that's where we lose\n[noise]\n\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay [noise]\n\n\nOkay can you hear the\nEchoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up the [noise] the hill kind of bounce around um water I think it's for deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where it's dripping everything up here it's frozen solid so sure what that is [noise]\nUm but I think I'm going to turn background\nWhich had parts of flowers or something [noise]", "show_name":
