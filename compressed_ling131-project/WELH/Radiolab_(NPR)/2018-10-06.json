{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "Sunday afternoon at two in Rhode Island public radio\nBefore we start today's episode we wanted to know this broadcast contains tape that describe violent events some there's some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be forewarned way you're\n\nListening to radio lab [noise] radio Romney there'll be you and why [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] we're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay I think is good right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start getting what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nKilled when that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again in the press how many people do see killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire as a mere right Haitian Harris than double John Ritter and will become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply yeah the problem is we don't know\nThey have no idea because nobody's track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police department itself in the police department it does\nIn any accurate way up by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching their word Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that's right so Ben and his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBurned so birth study had Florida\nIt's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records last and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... and then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\n... three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of taper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for\nThis involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive saying that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing been put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show back\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on the stuff\nProbably five thousand pages so I have a stack of papers that's I'm about as tall as me six feet tall and broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county\nBoca Raton Boynton Beach uh all the way through the\nAlphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk but\nIt's a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida in the in in six years time two thousand nine to us from fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was there a chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons and some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there last link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us well\nThe biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the number of states that he but a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nSeems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what\nOur that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas that whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think his weapon\nSo it's ... I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting ... this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite\nWell you know the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to Ben central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida demographics\nAnd your what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white southern cells much right now but the breakdown between the ...\nFor the same demographics and this was that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very far ... percent six kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's gets me is like the I don't know\nIt's back to where we were in why we want to start this nasty nasty stuff still just moved by the single case is the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know [noise] I mean they're all written in this ah\nDeployment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call on this is the Cato sterile police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife and apartment to fight it how every one of these every report is at least one human life\nSomeone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nSo we have on this table that the investigation of the deaths\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople to [noise]\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nGuilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you\nFamily more than just\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this after every every event or a no no just wanted to know was there and has been telling everyone involved in\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this as big as this must be part of the different types of learning center part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is a critical gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the large staged a certain point because it was talking to two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house of like a like some big [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really I go through my house she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House just [noise]\n\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen\nKnow\nThey come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nTo the summer's wildfire [noise]\n\nAnd [noise] now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is talk of Clinton we start to stay over it and that's how we see each other head on the couch you know A M mattresses\nIt becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the policy for up talking you know getting to know each other more some advice oldest children so it's like therapy for\nFifties let me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe we're at ... to\n... when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people him in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy bragging\nBut we usually the videos that just came down Sesame Street mosque\nSmall house probably over like right now and then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we called extradition and the vegetables are 'cause the guardian was here and vegetables before\nAnd all that well I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here is all you can smell was on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat mhm at times and it brings you right back here mhm\nYep\nIn the toy was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\nChristmas I started ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\n\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my ... a lot of what a bad economy\nA couple of women Henry their phone number is on the Web\nYeah\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face alright three two one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just wanted to thank you for just sharing with us because I Know [noise]\nI mean we we haven't been I have\nIt was also the great science we saw that last week\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's wave it's about Fifteen minutes talk\nAbout this at home I have to go there all the time of course yeah now Flora is how could you not\nIt ain't no way you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit fair yeah and it's crazy because like if a listen if a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm and it's crazy you know that as like a certain time every\nDay and it's the little white man we share\nEverything like I said I like he literally I think he does he liked to have lunch with every day\nMy dad would be I don't know if you if it's the way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that's always sit down and\nHe took his chair I Can't hold\nKnow what I'm [noise]\nSo that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise]\nOr you can either repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter\nWas lower than to the\nEnd of their understand that a few of these women started call themselves the mothers [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in D. C.\n[noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife and a look at the razor thin life or death moment\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about Sloan W.

[noise]\n\nThis is Rhode Island public radio [noise] coming up at two o'clock\nFreakonomics radio [noise]\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me\nYou're lucky you didn't just shot warning sign your best shot actually if you want to die if you want a guy you can die\nHe tells the officer was Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nTheir fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick him up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys were you use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and the guy leans in the current judge that when I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on\nA trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nGuys partner was holding a gun have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they want officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek\nIsn't just a black man shirtless with a knife and at the end when there's no connection there is a lot easier to see somebody whose name was at a face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of or a poor that made the officer think of how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finished watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight get through the neighborhood I mentioned on the front step waves of hatred what are you doing man that dared does stupid sort of a bitch you and how close came to be in that wouldn't be backwards medication wasn't doing drugs and he was as ... as normal as me and you are right now\nNow again are almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last primary election among the winners tournaments just please she has now militia valuable Sarah my shit would was elected the sheriff of\nLinn county [noise] I Am\nReally which is the county that the tone of each belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which decrease executive research\nForum it's a big coalition of police cheese and a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity of human life [noise]\nNow just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have a have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing way policing is done in America or at least maybe slowly but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and that sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had read realized\nHow far [noise]\nHope has to go [noise]\n\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay tuned [noise]\nThis is Ryan ... calling from stover Mont

Tosh Clemens touch her husband's mother Rodney Mitchell okay\nSo it's actually the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center of ... other mothers who've lost their children and that's actually when I first met her bed and had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because Ben what's going to hand a ton of documents over ten Pasha on her son Romney's case 'cause she didn't have any\nAnd I was there because we set up a short interview and in touch but when we got your doors [noise]\n\nShe just started Saudi [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nAnd\nThen I just had no idea of what\n\nBut then she had just turned the tape recorder off\nOh what was what was happening in that moment well okay it's a backup so meeting somebody like a chip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I Believe but\nThe thing about a chip would I'm a share of the police chief is that\nThe only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that it goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong they'd acted in accordance with the law and it just so happened that forty five minutes before\nJust got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that she'd filed against that decision I had just been rejected and so we sat there in ... department for a while we actually even left for like an hour eventually came back [noise] kinda just hit reset on the whole thing [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ... long dreads it's got a big smile they smile right white smiling\nAnd then we sat down in her kitchen table um okay so uh if you can walk me back to the night that kind of everything everything happened\nIt's June eleven two thousand twelve Natasha was at home nine thirty at night Rodney who is twenty three years old was a back from college you know driving a car and that's when all the phone call started happening people calling saying\nSomething going on with your car I knew something was wrong so I immediately started screaming outside to see if I could get somebody to respond to help me so I can get a ride nobody came came out I started running down the interstate barefoot which just laugh I don't even recall walk in the door or anything like that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
