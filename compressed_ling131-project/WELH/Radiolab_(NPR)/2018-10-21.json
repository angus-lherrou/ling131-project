I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't see that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must but we ... it is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to mention went on it yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after so let's start can we start in two thousand eight Georgia how about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\n\nSo uh December twenty seventh a sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there I didn't work either this\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie newer\nAnd what what are you calling I'm a\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period\n\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shots Facebook triggered hordes asking what would become a loud but do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs buck today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them [noise] free speech [noise]\nViolence against roe kingdom muscle what we can say in what we can't say that again by this iconic photograph what we\nCan see and what we can see it led Mueller right judge frustrates me on\nOn the Internet [noise]\n\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr\nSack of arc I got to give you some jak get laid prioritize or censor ...\nCongresswoman we don't even think about what we're doing a censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and diet\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the glow which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees [noise]\nAll right ready so at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in the early\nTo thousands seismic change in this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path my space dot com is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood\nOf ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them\nIn front of their own computer and things that come up onto their screen flag to to Facebook and\nI'm like meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nIs Kate clinic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of times\nIn the early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then that content\nAlong with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen most of what you were saying was either\nNaked people blown off heads or\nThings that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying\nAnd every time something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take a doubt and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your party leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that day at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nFriday's fight for the lights that rather than the\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but\nAccording to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on\nSocial networking website is under fire for it and tell them the unfolding of women brand new meeting their child right down in twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring and they have the best thing is I didn't\nHundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington\nPost so the Internet is an interesting Dr phil it was a media storm\nAnd eventually perhaps as a result of our group and our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules\nSo for example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nPrecisely all of these people at Facebook were in charge of trying to define nudity\nSo I mean yeah the first cut out it was visible male and female genitalia and then visible female brass and then the question is well okay how much of a breast needs to be showing before it's Newt and the thing that we landed on was if you could see essentially the nipple and Ariel lower than that's nudity\nQuestions that we\nFound out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting femi happening\nA lot about the good work [laughter] so now I Am I searched by these you know sorry she worked in\nI Know your life in fact most\nPeople wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's the is there something wrong about being in like an NBA that\nThey find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk do you want to be named her you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather lie that's totally fine you know I was ... a year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to ah admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct are headed for about ... watch\nBlind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor graphic images\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you already know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to she he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nI ignored ... sorry\nCan I just I just I I I Will test every day it was just elected official alleged which\nFight five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day\n[noise] well if if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nAll of this is like that where they um it's two at ... ... a\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things federal\nHas

if you don't want to hear this kind of thing and it gives you the kids in the room might want to sit it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April Fifteen to twenty Thirteen strike\nAin't gonna let Rhonda Merrill aside but sorry my my aunt had to make it up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carla\nMonday the fifteenth twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure

photos show is that the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who are his face is Ashton from all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's ... ...\nMeanwhile CBS Feehery a studio on the other side of the country is fine I remember snippets of the day [noise] Facebook employees\nAre clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news right now\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo\nPublished online and it wasn't long after without\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but\n[noise] pretty quickly voters going viral [noise]\nWe realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is reading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy essentially this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which the media the received push back well I was saying that\nCause and there are exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here let's be humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff that other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can\nPull the lever word starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\nReally\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\n\nYes so um yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organization strengths parents\nDo let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and that's an idea responsible for your conscience which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that's incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically sucker burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where are they can't be held liable for much of anything\nThey're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this\nIs it's here you have a company that really uh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of\nThis or that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera and then a man\nPulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in
