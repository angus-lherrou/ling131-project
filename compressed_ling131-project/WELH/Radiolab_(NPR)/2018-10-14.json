[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIt's time now to practice some very useful phrase is I'll say the first year repeat I remembered and together that's but yeah\nThis is radio lab today translation\nIt's time to begin\nWe'll have five experiments in translation trench creation\nLesson number one the best hope was by my mother got cut off the people they might not know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty startling levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little about the kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage vertical or you know three\nSyllables per line to super skinny and twenty eight lines long and long and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize that are still not\nBy heart diplomas basically a get well card it's written by this guy ... who was a poet in the early Eighteen hundreds at the court of queen\nAnd then he wrote a pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she had gotten sick the flu or something in this problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in ... let's just here at first\nOkay it's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos hell so to speak ... of the young lady\n... who doesn't look boom through new ... piece of getting you know who they ... to ... ...\n... see onto the taboo ... coffee to ... to ... to ... ... ...\n\nOh my God it must have gotten so many checks and you know it was really [laughter] exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise] [noise]\nOkay so he reads a poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decided to have it translates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set ... here's the thing he says he got this problem mommy none of them doesn't loom\nFrom and if you just focus on the words of basically it's just this guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president ... I ... to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam few too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped ... or ... you know it's sort of like get better here's to your good health\n... to ... I mean young but\nJust saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted mass\nEnd and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form\nIt's wonderfully catchy\nLittle sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA B. B. C. C. D. D. and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean you know just sort of has the feel of the Palin drove it has the poets name in the middle of the poems in ... oh and I forgot that I say three syllables per allow you didn't ya yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this problem you know along the way even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example\nVast the onto the boost used to\nLike this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead\nOf hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their can instead of squirming in your own bed of slurping sloppy and instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in bed\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my proves translations lead my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick band you're a for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health being near my sweet dear\nSo claim laws now Douglas yeah Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the ones on jammed the Cambridge though the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly\nThey are words but the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on ... like just stick their fingers and jelly no bread neat\nHe hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent the palm to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health dress and fleet off with me Clement who calls from very different in tone and really quite marvelous\nYou got the pale face in there you go to Jan Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but ... says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number for this just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole road at three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue it was the form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel like nails the foreign he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet treat one regard Otis hard your colleagues friends chicken D. I. decree a fine day\nEven got his wife to do one daughter away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee the group that was all burnt themed hope you will to ham apple jam and

withdrawing eight or ... support and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about this\nWe have previously calls for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy\nThank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response do you think he was aware\nOf the misunderstanding who carry or this or the sun oh yeah no I followed\nHim out afterwards [noise] um [noise] can you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is on any of ... he's a young guy in his twenties he's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you listen\nWhat happened there and I felt like some kind of cultural a guide me\nIs that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space is serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could and not just speak are you\nGoing to do yeah ... exactly my point are you going to take sanctions maybe quietly the obvious ones yeah do you feel that that question for you at risk maybe who knows is that is a job description doing good journalism in Egypt to\n[noise] make so much thinking they give you could make my numbers on there\nSo that conversation was about five months ago did you know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether did he suffered for this question in any way now but I have his phone number so I can give them a call in and find out\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] and I and I mean it's it's Gregory Gregory\nAnd I reached him by Skype he told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nWell I got to lighten up we are going on together with them and their addiction and that\nThey said you shouldn't line up with the government's priority yeah\nThese messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism task force will wage social media tax by getting people to send messages on his behalf you\n... out of the ones that are saying these kinds of things\nAnd where they threatening yeah\nSome of them where you know you can get in there that the French Quarter being the one good thing comes and it might come ...\nNewspaper he founded get shut

Krulwich and our producer so and we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin and why is George Carlin mention\nOh because Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedians are\nMeeting yeah [noise] and it's like I say is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling or some I really like this one too is about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like words that hide the truth I don't like words that conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality and Carlin\nWas wonderful about things like that was about both\nAs she called and we have no more people in this country no more old people we shift them all away and we brought in these senior citizen [noise]\nPaintings on civil rights\nThe reason we use the if it's just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs so that hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but Karlan is real point was that it it like Dole's our\nReactions to it that actually have like I have a negative fat and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming pie TST no he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked\nSimple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battle for the battle for the for some of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much\nAnd then after became battle fatigue then it became operational exhaustion [noise]\nHey we're up to eight syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we added a hyphen and then it became peachy as post traumatic\nStress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon this was the\nOr will notion that you could erase sensitivities if you've bland it out the words so if you stop saying no yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some for some interrogation\nOr enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a Carlin saying it's just like now that his PATS Steve we are not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nShell shocked I'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at that time [noise]\nEspecially uptown where the streets are a lot lighter\nShe says people see her and her white cane and

D. C. A. A. C. A. G.\nOther words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triples not pairs because if you have a sense of three or rather than to the game I figured well that'll give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins\nThe double helix duo Watson and Crick\nAnd a group of other scientists worked it all out they they figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into proteins\nHere's how it works and sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting\nThere all coiled up a set of molecules come along and ... and a copy of it\nThis copies now made of ... which is like DNA very similar still in the basic sort", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "14"}
