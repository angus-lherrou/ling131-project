Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine but we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty startling levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking French literature class one day I came across this poem a tiny little about\nThe kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage vertical a free syllables per line so it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorize that are still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card written by this guy ... who was opposed nearly Fifteen hundred at\nThe court of queen\nThen he wrote a pound for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she had gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and I thought it was very sweet\nOkay it's called a ... done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak it can wait they affect young lady\nMommy none of us who doesn't look ... to ... ... ... ... ...\n... the onto the top ... to ... to ... about it ... for ... to ... I mean young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many chicks and you're right it was really exactly\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads a poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular in the publisher decides to have it\nTranslates into a number of languages including French in that process which took years it put me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is it what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set we here's the thing he says he got this power\nMoney and young has done little going from\nAnd if you just focus on the words is basically just this guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president who says you see a piece of I cling on to ... to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam goofy too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your lumps shaped ... or ... like get better here's to your good health ... to ... I mean young but\nJust saying those words in English misses the whole\nSpirit of the ... the tone the light hearted mass end and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know\nA BBC CD and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean you just sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems they've known to Vermont oh and I forgot I did I say three syllables per allow you didn't ... yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became\nEmbroiled in the question of like how do you translate this come along the way he began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example vast sea onto the tub boost used to like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed I had a lot\nOf possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their can instead of squirming in your own vendetta slurping sloppy and in the dead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue in bed\nOn and on and I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I sent cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't ale very long just gets strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you are a for my sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not go away\nMy sweet dear\nSo claim all his now Douglas yeah claimed all became Douglas and I I like the other ones are jammed but can even bread though the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly\nThey are words but the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on oh her just\nSome people would just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ... to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nOddly enough Bob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFairest friend let me send my embrace quit this place it's dark halls and bank whoa\nIn soft still regain health dress and fleet off with ... Clement who calls from very different in tone and really quite marvelous you\nGot the pale face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient Rome but ... says no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he was a sacrosanct number so that's just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue it was a form that's what made the thing funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nails before he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I treat one regard Otis hard ... colleagues friends\nChicken D. I. decree a fine day even got his wife to do one daughter away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee\nThe group that was all bird themed hope you scoop into ham apple jam and French ... running around from town to town saying hey I got a ... a buddy one lady and I am a person of binges this began a been she myself\nIn that they ended up becoming a seven hundred page book filled with translations of this pump\nGo ahead and read about her best one now this is that right right no that's not the best one it is that one at ... ... ... extra K okay\nThis is also one of his but like the twenties when he did\n... golf so swarmed hug from up some dumb bug drag you down that friends feel the urge bugs for\nFrom the Sergio emerging attract sound advice from Doug slash clown so smashed ... come you come you who lived to sheets s\nSweet let's choose ... heart make your heart competing claims mandate sure hope God cures your body had defeat ...\n[laughter]\nI was at its humor yeah although not the best he says I I Do want to get to my mother's translate ads here where's my mother's\nWas somehow I'm going to have to look it up here where we're from the district has long confiscated and [noise] be for\nThis one from his mommy says came along years after he started here it is and he thinks it might be the winner high towards get well hospital\nMay be threatening you will be a who is a withdrawing eight or with strong support and Kerry says I Am very seriously talking about\nWe have previously called for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too furious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry a this uh this film and oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards\n[noise] um [noise] can you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy and twenty she's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um I was like you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and I felt like some kind of cultural a guide\nMe is that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space in serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could and not just speak are you\nTo do yeah this is as us exactly my point out is going to take sanctions maybe going the obvious ones yeah do you feel that that question put you at risk\nAnd doing good journalism you need to get\n[noise] make so much thinking you didn't just give you any from my numbers on that in\nThat conversation was about five months ago did you do know what his faith that at all I mean we found out whether did he suffered for this question in any way nobody had his phone number so I can give them a call in and sign up\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] and I and many of its Gregory Gregory Warner oh legal the audience I enjoyed I and I\nReached him by Skype you told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he better rethink what he said\nYeah I started lighting up with a gun on together with them and the Arctic shipping and that uh\nThey said you shouldn't line up with the government's priority\nYeah these messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this if you will be an anti terrorism taskforce will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf you\nBelieve in John ... he's in trouble for out of the ones that are saying these kind of makes it\nAnd were they threatening yeah\nSome of them where you know we've been in there that I Will be bunch duck or being the one good thing comes and it might come ...\nNewspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nSay my safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states you\nKnow my mother and my older brother good are they being your your it's Washington\nOkay Washington\nLike a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in the in the states\nDid they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah I've heard that the what is your mom say she said\nPlease don't do that they will go it might be you know how to get can you things like that you know ... like that there\nYet not like that yeah\n\n... ...\n... ...\nOf all you have a\nBoon knees and\nBeing a ...\nB minus on\nRadiolab will continue minimum and they have\nOne daughter crawling hey this is Gregory Warner and spoke to read trucks radiolab supported in part by the

in ... journalism alliance\nDamn ... this is radio lab today [noise] five experiments in translation let some number three ... ... ... ... ... now you're try\nThis one a Robert Krulwich and our producers Owen we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin and why is George Carlin mentioned\nOh because Carl and it's a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language you're talking about the comedian\nComedian yes [noise] and then next thing is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he got from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling her and I really like just went to his about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like words that hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality as Carlin was wonderful\nAbout things like that was about both as she\nCalls and we have no more people in this country no longer all people we shift them all away\nAnd we brought in these\nSenior citizen\nAnd he was on so that that's the\nReason we use ... I just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he dies and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise book Carlin's real point was that it it like does\nOur reactions to it that actually have like I have a negative effect and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shock becoming PATS too you know he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battles the battle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhausted [noise]\nHey we're up to eight syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as post traumatic stress disorder\nUnder jargon this was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you're blended out the words so if you stop saying no yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some for some interrogation or enhanced interrogation\nThat makes a big difference in part of a curling saying it's like now that his pie TST we are not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nShell shocked I'll bet ya if we'd have still been calling a shell shocked some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at that time\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI hardly ever notice other people walking around me I feel like\nI can always hear the topic and it sounds ...\nBut she says when she put the device on and put those sensor undertone [noise] the sidewalk one\nCame alive or not it was amazing like I didn't know that this many people are on the street at the same time as they can now they're um [noise] they're all there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting\nLike really soft watches it anything that sounds nice soft wrong she says\nThat can move [noise] they\nIn that game [noise] but I couldn't see them clear you know like I can see the change or\nWhether they're wearing a shirt or a short haired Jack [noise] has aids just they see their shadow\nAnd every now and I see the light constant on then really yeah [noise]\nI imagine some alec underwater creatures uh-huh squishy jellyfish like yeah\nYeah ... yeah [noise]\n\nYeah like [noise]\n\nIn that friendly is what it's like to translate the city with your tongue [noise] New York city becomes is a cheesy sea of walking fish that make their way alone in the sunshine [noise]\n\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a video of Emily painting using the brain port and you can check that out by going to radiolab dot org\nI'm I'm a I'm\n\n\nA ...\n\nThis is Frank

this is the public's radio [noise] coming up it's more radiolab and freakonomics radio at two o'clock [noise] followed\nBy the splendid table at three and then on the media [noise]\n\nThis is the public's radio\nI'm Steven down there on the next economics radio one of the men who helped rebuild New York city after nine eleven now helping build the city of tomorrow\nOur mission is really to use

number five how does it make providers all without a ride wisdom to meet the right to the corner they should give their ... their ... ... you know you try\nTo you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes\nWe're going on an army fishing expedition sure sure as the ah here's here's the here's our quandary girl okay what's your situation we're doing Sean ... okay so recently we sat down with a reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about\nOur name ... we were talking about something else in our name came up at the end 'cause heres why ever since we started doing this show Robert got his [laughter]\nGot his I got a little in systems as little as I just in a 'cause you're like our innate we gotta do are now yes I said that are and I was like what do you want to do and you're like I Want to do or nay and I was like but is there a story and you're like\nNo no I didn't say that I just said that that that that if you understood what our innate does you'd realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence such like that yeah well as often happens you or me down\nBack as like All right fine let's just try it and they'll say you know\nSo when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up and unfortunately I think this is a day when you were out of town I think your your son's getting married yes he was and ah her I was doing like tech team work for me [laughter]\nOkay All right so the definition of translation and biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins mhm [noise] right and the discovery\nOf this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double helix structure really yeah\nIt was bigger than Watson and Crick yeah well at least equivalent wow so here's a quick story so what happened was\nOkay I suggest to set the table here we all know the DNA is a thing in that when you're born you get half your DNA from your mom and a half your DNA from your dad Francis Crick and and er James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically\nThe rest of the of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string a T C and gee that's it but he is the problem see like we humans were more than DNA we are these flashy keen piles of muscle and bone and all of that\nStuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from proceeding yeah\nWe have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body different kinds of pertains\nTo the question was like how how does all that get generated like how did this for simple base has become the methods to become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us\nHow do you make the transition ... people were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved\nAnd the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist as cosmologist named George gamma huh and gamma just said wait a minute this isn't that complicated this is just gripped hunger iffy\n[noise] this is a code problem ... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein so I just need to think\nOf a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Gigi ... and then out comes the protein the what what simple code could I Do to do that\nThinking this guy came out to side\nI think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\n[noise] like instead of a T. C. G. A. C. cannot thought maybe it's a TA seizing J. D. C. A. A. C. A. G. ...\nIn other words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triples not hair because if you have sense of three or rather than to game I figured well that give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins\nNow this is just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick\nAnd a group of other scientists worked at all out they they figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into proteins\nYou're so works sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting\nThere all boiled I'm a set of molecules come along attached to it and zip it and make a copy of\nThis copies now made an RN ... which is like DNA very similar instill in the basic sort of four letter format but it's now on the move 'cause it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
