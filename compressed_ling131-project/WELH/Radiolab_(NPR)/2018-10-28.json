N. Y. [noise]\nThree two one hey I'm ... I'm rubber cruel which uses radio lab and today we have a legal case\nWell it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal\nCase this case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away they it's gets under your skin this is Lisa ... I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us the story and under whose skin or he also seems to have gotten\nYeah it it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ... he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping out around ducks pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM to campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck nice binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other two campers you got all four of them rounded up\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods took him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them\nAre the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he type\nSo after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy\nEighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids were spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing ... stuck and I\nUsed to have been five times and the cats\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to\nBreak loose and start running Nick Fury salary into his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted then the killer and Freeman laying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun these going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and thus began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nThere was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID\nPay thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape ... seven years now armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so\nBy Tuesday night when the people got panicked and you're all well one of the\nDoors are locked people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says a man has done what happened was Gail was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive\nDay after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on it\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted gal\nSaid freeze or got big on something of that fact and scare started running\nLow blocked by your four times got 'em in the back the arm in the foot Guerra went down once got\nYou know found a blood trail and just in a very short time I saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but but you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nThe so they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and\nFor a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk it's at this point that the story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor release alarm and again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording so the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nBreakage army\nAnd Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is er money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York is our money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway and it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights like standing up for the gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defended you're fighting this state and tyranny\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong back to ... you need a forty five and a or just had the feeling that this guy is dangers in love with things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers you represented him at first on two pretty\nSmall things one on a school teacher Heather shelves due to this trial the blooms sued the school\nAnd I talked to monitor but none head on all of them were actually represented\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\n... ... for [noise]\nUm well let's see some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped this court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from girls wife\nAnd then we went up the back door [noise] took of\nDriving that lady friends car to drive the news and the two homes\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this may be as far as\nWe can walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren chemistry and the town supervisor of Mariah Tom's 'cause if Ava system a road that goes to the mine is or what is fair to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is this a\nTrail of her own or you're just\nA very icy that day this here is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly teeth are no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could've came around here\nSo that so here we are and for Sunday's shoots and regroup trudging to force looking for\n[noise]\nYou spent another horse [noise]\nAnd then food [noise]\nFrom this was her friend well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lower\nThe or sneak shoe simply sneaker\n[noise]\nAnd and a leg and I said to myself this some of which does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your money back up very\n\nEventually algae found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options sure so option what we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids\nWere the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can you just can't we took her to know to keep the confidence is over ... under the current\nRules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if if if people are already dead than you do the lawyers shoe\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if\nMaybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for their clients\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and family seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nOf course yes and I knew Mr hawk from going to lose his du da da da da da da da da da da and I knew him from church and\nOne if you have to be a man on the ... the parents of the family when you do you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now what is [noise]\nEven harder [noise] we'll be right back [noise] [noise]\n\nThis is worthy from Arlington, Texas reading aloud to

I'm I'm Roger I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer bena feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing they knew their client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what what's their next move\nWell so they decided to put the burden plea bargain\nThat take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give up and move on and you're going to take it a little well that's kinda gross oh\nYeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank's perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Henry McCabe investigator from the state police detective located in the district attorney armies office and when they met Armenian bell gee search the briefcase was up to be a and the investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Belgian present the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nHold there you're talking about Susan ... like these are the two girls that we're most concerned\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven it was for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nI don't go was here are just was a lawyer to\nDo this job [noise] uh ... I was a good lawyer ... through\nArt everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and build you did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what if people think what if what if what if\nYou will face so I went to a couple of classes\nI went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the\nFamilies involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing their mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught us the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal shot in their mind is not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and up\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we will with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was or some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my\nMy father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli the lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying\nOf horror and [laughter] and that is why did they taught law schools\n\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone or law professors law students there um when they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um like you have a chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate in words I made forty years later and skills\nI I guess it's a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I Am so\nI don't know I guess\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\nWell what can I say she was she did receive her degree past few months later I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and um\nAnd Danny what's your boyfriend had just that summer and he had a full scholarship to harbor any uh graduated just the year before and so to live\nAnd I'm sure the other two children had great future had a true\nAnd it's just a horrible tragedy\n\nSo it's horrible to be in the position\n[noise] I mean how do you really lose you use the order of ... what are the ... for protecting the person the killer no justification you couldn't just apply in my mind\nExpects them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\n\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay\n\n\nEchoes of dogs don't amount and things tend to travel up the up the hill kind of bounce around um water I think it's\nSome deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where it's dripping everything up here is frozen solid so sure what that is [noise] um but I think I'm going to turn background\nI Wish I'd put some flowers or something\n[noise]", "year": "2018",
