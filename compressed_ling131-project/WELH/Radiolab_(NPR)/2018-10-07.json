{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "Before we start today's episode we wanted to know this broadcast contains tape that describe violent events some there's some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be forewarned way you're\n\nListening to radio lab [noise] radio around I mean there'll be you and why [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to\n[noise] we're\nGoing to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before and say something high [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good very where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it\nWhat are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown's shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed\nWhen that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about just by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire me right hasten Harris than about John become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing now like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nAnd I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit some public conscious\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented Brazil burst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\n... three hundred and eighty eight emails\nAsking for five years worth of paper any\nPaper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now this involves a year of work how many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing they're both probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing\nThen put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of the show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many accidents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages I have a stack of papers that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got um broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county\nBook or a Tom boy and beach uh\nAll the way through the alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers and spread across the entire desk is\nA combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise] didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase all\nThe demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people are hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile\nThe data and build a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions from lessens some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at last link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest and sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the number of states that he about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and a ...\nMakes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like in the most basic level\nA are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds at the time of the shooting and in that category\nBeen says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch\nAnd toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a\nWeapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting or is that is right this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to Ben central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tells much right now but the breakdown between fatalities\nFor the same demographics and as we sat there going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very far ... percent six kind of ... he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this nasty nasty things I'd still just moved by the single cases individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know I mean they're all written in this ah\nSupplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call ... Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife a department to fight for every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either\nYou know more often than not gravely injured or killed\nSunni have on this table that the investigation of the deaths\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople to [noise]\n\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMac guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories\nAnd if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org and you can hear part two of the series where we follow a totally different story than the one we're going to tell you about today but I'm\nFamily more than just\nSo after the event ended up community center crystal took\nA bunch of the mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or a no no just wanted to know was there and has been telling everyone involved in\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nBut no we didn't know anything about this thing and this must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping dream right right we all just simply trying to find our way is a critical gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the largest age as there and going because it was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like some [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew when I go through my house she says his age comes down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\n[noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\n[noise]\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nIn the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nOf summers when fire [noise]\n\nAnd now we're redoing instead of getting motel room\nFor much of the house with me in each other bad on the couch you know a air mattress it's it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some sort of vice over his shoulder thoughts like therapy for\nVicki is let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me I Believe or add um sex Marlon promise to\nAnd it was when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that just came down with a video\nThat sets the free time off\nMy house probably over like right now and then the police caught attain behind him was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nAnd then when\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call execution a vegetable garden 'cause the guardian was here in\nAnd all that that I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back here it's all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat mhm and your concert brings you right back here mhm\nYup\nIn the toilet was just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n'cause those are some ... some of the other one that started crying [noise]\n\n\nAnd then you don't want me to a Texan yeah my find to be a lot of what about falling to me\nA couple of women enemy their phones focusing on what life is going to run\n[noise] yeah\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back up to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing with us because I Know [noise]\nWe we haven't been I had\nIt was up to the very fine we saw that last week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nAnd my son's friends about Fifteen minutes from my visit home I\nHave to go there all the time of horror yeah that would force how could you not\nThen I Know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh sit there yeah and it's crazy because like it's a ...\nAnd it's crazy

I Hope\nKnow but I'm [noise]\nPleasure trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise]\nTo me to reveal who was some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael parents mother Eric Garner's mother\nWatched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ground\nAnd it was around this time that a few of these women started called themselves the mothers [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in D. C.\n[laughter]\n\nIt was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nKind of felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and put it down a cop with a gun a man with a knife and a look at the razor thin life or death moment\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about slow not W.
