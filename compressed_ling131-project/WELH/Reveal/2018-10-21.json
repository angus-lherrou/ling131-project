friends are waiting for her in the car but she pauses for a second\nIf a person thinks that my vote not long camp a no vote is just like a yes vote\nYou that that's telling them that you don't care one way or the other but as a responsible citizen and a person in the state of Georgia you need to vote\nYou really do you need to teach your children the importance of voting you go out and you beat the bushes and you complain which you don't vote\nMore than one hundred million Americans of voting age didn't go to the polls in twenty sixty so Democrats and Republicans are trying to get the numbers to work for their side the Democrats are hopeful here in Georgia a Democrat has won the governor's mansion since Nineteen Ninety eight\nOn a story about people who send removed from the voter

of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues

looks at the governor's race like this it's all about who shows up at the polls camp wins if the racial breakdown of voters stays about where it's been in recent elections Abrams wins by getting more people of color to the polls\nBoth probably need to win over some voters who haven't made up their minds but finding those types of voters could be really tough\nYou have to polarized angry tribes

your name is among the list\nBut even if you get into the booth your vote might not be properly counted [noise] Georgia is one of five states that rely solely\nOn touch screen voting machines with no paper audit trail cyber experts have warned about these machines for years and recently so as President Trump\nAnd one of the things we're learning is it's always good it's old fashioned but it's always good to have a paper backup system of voting it's called paper not highly complex computers paper\nReal cause for concern special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted twelve Russian agents for

so here's where the memory cards [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta\nHis specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines he has is the kind of Georgia uses edits polling places the machine is bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between the Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots it up so it was actually touch the litter\nAnd then it's the can pressing the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning and use that as my ring time\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail for Logan and other cybersecurity tight that's a major red flag\nIn fact dear he's had been criticized by technologists basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the continued use of paper less voting machines in this country\nThreatens our national security and the department is now prepared to recommend paper ballots\nAnd so yes sorry if there is no way to audit the election that is absolutely a national security concern why didn't look satisfied and you now told us that the status quo is a national security threat\nHe studies the arteries and their vulnerability\nThat says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you inject information or inject basically now we're a virus into any part of the tree the way it is set up is that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the ...\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nThey asked Georgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterm [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable one of them even hacked voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side where ... people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after the hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adopting paper ballots over electronic one for the midterm elections\nJudge ... filed an order in favor of Frank ... she wrote that switching to paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the order\nQuote the court is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system\nBy the way throughout the hearing camps team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none fat hacking she wrote is here to stay in quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national\nCyber security engineers an expert\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems the machines that very few people trust\nKennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does to people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference\nThey say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight teams and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first email that we know our elections are vulnerable but we can't fix\nThem because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question let me ask you this how sure\nAre you that somebody didn't beat you to this uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean it's still to this day I'm very concerned [noise]\n\nReveals by those who

World Service at nine o'clock\nAnd uh [noise]\nThis is the public's radio [noise] pleasant Sunday evening\n[noise]\n\nFrom the center for investigative reporting NPR ... this is reveal I'm allergic to date we've been talking about voter suppression in fear of voter fraud\nPeople are worried about it in part because of what President Trump has been saying\nThat many places like California the same person votes many times you've probably heard about that they always like to say oh that's a conspiracy theory not a conspiracy theory Fox millions and millions of people those claims\nHave been totally ... but one of the people who got those theories going was a Kansas lawyer who's waged a long running campaign against what he calls voter fraud his name is Kris Kobach he's the Kansas secretary of state\nAnd while that's typically a pretty sleepy office he's a household name in his home state even used to have a weekly radio show\nThe ACLU worst nightmare 'cause he knows the constitution advice or keep them from making trouble for any of it is Kris\nKobach spin a loyal Trump supporter from the beginning Trump appointed him to run his so called election integrity commission it was disbanded less than a year after it was started without accomplishing anything Peggy Lowe of Casey you are in Kansas City has been covering Kobach for years\nThey pay hey ask so Kobach is from a small state population wise but he has his big national profiles conservative circles how did that happen\nSo called about is a longtime anti immigration crusader he drafted in Arizona law that basically gave law enforcement a lot more authority to stop people and question them about their immigration status it was called the papers please law that's dating back to about twenty ten\nAnd since then he's been aligned with white nationalist groups who backed that effort and that's when he got on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center who now calls Kobach the lawyer for America's native his movement\nSince then his anti immigration crusade has morphed into this campaign against what he calls massive voter fraud caught claims that illegal aliens that's attorney loves to use our voting in great numbers and this frog could be swinging election\nBut the way we know that that is not true that's right\nRosen percentages at you here but according to the Brennan Center for justice it would be harder for an American to be struck by lightning than to impersonate and how their voter but that doesn't stop Kobach he's a leader in the fight against this well it's a major problem\n[noise]\nYou interviewed ... book lists them or what was the looking person well you\nKnow come up makes a really good politician he's good looking he's charming he's really articulate but as a reporter he is also just maddening he will tell you that even your question is inaccurate he will fight chew on every term fatty afraid it would be\nA a you're used to the ... line as an actor and it's not off line\nThen you will thrill all these studies and statistics that you which many of these studies have been debunked by academics but he's still uses them it's like talking to Kris Kobach is arguing with your high school debate coach\nYou know you're talking to a guy who really wants you to lose the argument and I think he's really respected in some circles because he has a very impressive resume he has degrees from Harvard Yale University of Oxford\nAnd then he also has this other big help it's a tool called the interstate cross check system it's a massive voter tracking program under Kobach agreed to include more than half of the total voter registrations\nIn the U.S okay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicate voter registrations\nAnd most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California\nDid you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not\nThat's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election in two different states\nSo Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud\nThis is where Kobach signed in using cross check Kobus persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done and all these other states\nOkay so all of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power over prosecutor what's he doing with it well\nSo far he's turned up nine cases of this alleged voter fraud he's prosecuted them as felonies and they mostly played it down to misdemeanors", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Reveal", "city": "Providence", "day": "21"}
