and his family are torn apart not just because princes in jail but because he's in jail for so long\nWill what did he do to get locked away for a long period of time\nNot so much what he did out the

is\nChief prosecutor Leon can is arrow uses the law to hammer them\nThat they Bernard noble has served four years of his more than Thirteen year sentence for carrying less than three grams of

phone is in this one huge noisy room where he also sleeps and beef and spends his days along with over a hundred other men we've been talking for months one day prince caught me when I was really stressed out\n[laughter]\n... my hair down did you say [laughter]\n\n\nYou said he looked up because of the ... explain that well\nPrince was arrested a few times for drug charges which means he's known as a multiple offender or habitual offender and this law can now be applied to him here's how it works the more times you commit a felony the harsher and harsher punishment gets\nThe first person used to work for Ken is arrow as an assistant prosecutor Gregory Thompson so how long were you a da and\nRegular years a seven years but in ... and feels like an attorney\nThompson worked for Ken is arrow right after he was first elected I asked him how often the da's office use the habitual offender statute back then\nWhen I was going on and on point of the time I mean it was just it was a standard but it was\nEven lower offers relied or a better way of describing it it was just the way it was\nSo basically anytime that you could use that that too often or statute it was the policy of the da's office in Orleans Parish to use it\nCertainly I Can't think of an instance where we didn't do that\nOne way to think about the habitual offender statue is as a tool like a ranch or a hammer something prosecutors can pull out of their toy box when they need it but it's like do you can as arrow never puts this tool away it's always in his hand for every possible case\nThere's as mines that are the more before we lock up in the more time that we give people the more we're going to solve the crime problem on his father's one was from the ... you know harsh sentences or the turns\nNew Orleans public defender Danny ... says can is there a office still uses the habitual offender statue all the time and that makes guilt or innocence almost irrelevant instead it's all about a defendant's past their record\nIt's the first thing you're looking at is the start of every analysis of case every way you talk to your ... started every way you talk to the prosecutor and to the judge it's even a consideration for the prosecutors making bail arguments or even from the moments of your arrested part of the core of the case\nI also spoke to senior judge or leans parish criminal court Arthur hunter it was the middle of summer when it was over a hundred degrees outside he wasn't wearing a judge's robe instead black polo shirt black pants given the heat I had to tease him about it was this little light\nOr right this is a life like there's a lot of heavy but\nHe said over his blaring air conditioner the judge's job is kind of like our rafts between the defense and the prosecution asked judge hunter what he thinks of this law\nTakes away poses a problem with the functions of a judge\nWhich is to fashion as soon as that support is just simply for that particular person\nBecause when district attorney's use the vigil offender statute judges no longer decide how long the person will sit behind bars or under what conditions instead mandatory sentences kicking the judge has no choice\nIf I have someone with mental health issues or drug abuse issues I wanted that treatment asked to compose it'd be part of the sentence with the digital ... as soon as the twenty twenty five years that will be there no taxes just say twenty twenty five thousand a year for someone just to go away in ... [noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da Da Nang minutes away just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics around half white half black\nTheir da ... is really comparable to\nFor starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon can is arrow I Lived in Chicago how sure are you going to talk so I'll be going on ... street Hillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is air it was private Catholic high school but they are white men\nOthers will soon as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything is public safety can you surf I'm certainly with no charm a Jew or goes public sector really demand ...\nIn the ten years he's been da ... office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times\n[noise] [noise] I shared this number what the da and his spokesman denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I have\nI never heard back and an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\n[noise] the reason these two da's ... so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if prints have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana and he'd likely be home already ...\n\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean do you do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken as always\nEmphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nI'd be remiss if I had what I consider to be a prosecutor case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call desperate you guys do you make the decision whether or not that should be the law or not\nThat it's it's it is the law I think I have a responsibility to prosecutors if the facts are facts support that\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing in New Orleans [noise]\n\n[noise]\n... I'm just doing my job was he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very\nSqueaky chair can explain why my name is Jennifer Jones Austin a ... a\nCoal criminal law specialists\nAnd I heard that really you go by ...\nMay be a ... big you would do\nA ... a ... you know this is ... ... [laughter]\nIt's next to his kitchen and full of paper stuck by computer taped to the walls this is where biggie works he's been studying the law for decades and back in the seventies he saw this law which had been around for a really long time basically come back from the dead\nBecause the law the multiple bell which is one of its many names\nNobody would knowing if but when Harry can it can do is\nWe'll ... we'll wait wait wait wait wait a minute here did did you just say Harry comic the jazz singer no\nHarry ... senior\nWhen Harry counting came into office he use multiple below two shows up on this issue of society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of the day that was\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney Eric comic but just to use the powers of hers offer to help her image or your system but time and time again returns or ritual offenders to continue their own inhibited crimes against decent citizen\n[noise] this was the Nineteen seventies and crime was surging all over the country people were scared\nSo it was like ... ... so he bought this law back from when ... when do start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any person shot a third time being convicted of any crime VCR be considered as I'm it's just a ... a labor for life [noise]\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that a vigil center last really came in their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to imagining that the conflict as scary African American that\nThe kind of man who can never be rehabilitated an a penitentiary\nAnd for people who couldn't be transformed it it would become a place for storage for forced labor forced labor wow\nYeah and this leads us right back to a biggie before he became an expert on the law he fought in the Vietnam War where he also picked up a drug habit and when he returned home to Louisiana biggie killed a man and a botched robbery something he attributes to his addiction and untreated post traumatic stress\nAnd remember in these cases the da and ever officially charges the habitual offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nRight we know Ken is there a used a lot in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [noise]\n\nOf course Ken is there refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official\nBut he did offer a statement about princes case here a few parts that stood out to me Mr Albert voluntarily entered into a plea\nAgreement and received a legal sense under Louisiana law if he believes himself not guilty you could've exercised his constitutional right to stand trial then Kennedy era said my hope is that Mr Albert will apply himself toward programs by which to better himself\nAnd eradicate his substance abuse issues while in prison [noise]\n\nAfter I requested to interview ... he was moved from one jail to another to begin a drug program I asked him if this was the first time in his seven years locked up that he'd been in a program to treat addiction our connection was in great\nWhen did you do the first one\nTo limit so that was like six years and years\n[laughter]\nPrint said it took awhile for him to enter a program because they didn't really have programs [noise]\n[noise]\nJust wasting time sitting in one dormitory with a hundred and twenty people doing nothing\nSince seven years you've got three to go has anything changed
