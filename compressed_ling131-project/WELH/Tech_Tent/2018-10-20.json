gave me and we meet the man with a low tech approach to helping African farmers share ideas and move our phones\nJoining me this week is BBC technology reporter does that mean climbing ... kind of really good to have you to guide us through the stories and my special guest Mona El Salvador from the opposite Internet Institute's welcome mono and they have good to have you here for the first time here's a taste of what's coming out\nIn fact he he\nKept on the in the region of of fifty chickens and as and this was his entire livelihoods pay for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table or on a diseases ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days [noise]\nOlder that in a moment but first on Wednesday Twitter released of false data dump ten million tweets a total of three hundred and sixty gigabytes of material relating to Russian and Iranian so cool to troll ...\nThese are attempts to use Twitter to sway public opinion around the world\nMost of the tweets came from Russia's Internet research agency which has been accused of trying to sow discord in the United states and intervene in the twenty sixteen election on the house as Donald Trump\nNow which released this treasure trove of data as a tool for research is and journalists it gave it delves access to the think tank the Atlantic council whose digital forensic research that took a closer look the techniques employed by the trouble farms\nBeen Nemo who led to that effort at the last ... told me what they found\nThe assumption that being that the ... the Russian from operation peak in twenty sixty even during the election and then in the tiny Seventeen but actually the highest moment was late twenty four twenty Fifteen and that's because the majority of the posts are actually in Russian and they were targeting the Russian opposition on late twenty fourteen was when that was really happening\nBut you then sore eye I presume the\nTactics developed that's right you you could really see them learning how to use social media at the stump that content was really quite boring it was a lot of sheds from websites and it was a lot of fatty stilted comment\nAnd then you can see the individual accounts started getting more aggressive and more edgy I'm trying to be more funny\nAnd the more they did that the more they were getting audience response and they were also watching the real world I I get the feeling that they were obsessively watching the news channels\nAnd so when you called big events like um the the shooting in some other you know in California and December twenty Fifteen you could see the Russian trolls jumping in I'm most of them will be pushing the message that this is why Americans the guns and then some of them were pushing the message you this is why Americans need gun control\nSo they were watching for breaking news and then working at how they could turn up the heat on the debate\nDid you get the idea that there was sort of controlling mastermind behind it or whether they will\nHeading off in different different directions that was definitely some sort of editorial control going on um it didn't seem to be very fast moving and particularly in the days you would see a time that that something would happen in the U.S let's say on ... on Monday\nOn Tuesday individual Russian trolls and start re tweeting content at it and then I wouldn't say they will come out with the same halftime can they do these massive bursts of activity around ... hundreds of times in the day and you could you could imagine the editorial meeting which went on Tuesday evening saying right lots of tomorrow this is your ... this is what you'll be posting\nYoung women because we have a huge deficit and skills in our country huge deficit and people are studying computer science asked them are all kinds of areas are she crucial to the few ... of the rubble\nUn asking that river any different questions un interrupting it came up with a witness you wouldn't doing follow ups you are protecting the right but with a lot smarter than it was\nWell of course it broke both been programmed in and phone so he knew the path but I knew the questions but\nIt it wasn't meant to be a kind of special most it was trying to do was one demonstrate hit but as the program of young students Middlesex University a really great university or the ... that they had done that take an enormous amount of time but also showcase some of the work of ripple sticks ...\nTalks about the ... ah ah it it did and um it's companion sold in terms of a health care which is going to be a hugely important um with the arrival of focus revolution\nOn you're giving a false idea of what a ... a professor at Oxford University who leads the AI or if it's said a on sweats I was a a a gimmick and gave me the the wrong impression of I\nWell I saw that tweets might have to say\nIt was incredibly Snootzie we were trying to bring the community to millions of people thought that you were talking about it being on the BBC our television um it's being across the media because the public and also with\nAll the fourth industrial revolution in the same way that necessarily a policy makers might be and it's getting to have a huge impacts\nI'm showing potentially will be down a little type stuff for what could happen in the future but also stressing that we need to meet all skills deficit because of all the way our society is going to fundamentally change over the next ten Twenty years\n... house on and pay a Mona El ... how are you are listening to that um I don't know if you saw the robot in in the house of commons it was quite amusing\nDid you think it was a useful exercise\nI think it's the second time we had like major appearance or for opposites taking over and that if you're if you remember last year Saudi Arabia gave a rabbinical ... citizenship and yeah eight appearances it's I think\nThat was on the Arctic too isn't it like if I still\nThink the word we have this technology and I think it's it's good to to do this too racy but we're ... we're going to another Arab but I don't know how useful politically and how he feels that testimony was\nIs that a crime in you and I both met pepper icing on the air is oh well they know that small that you'd go completely false impression of our clever those rebels would\nYeah I think I think you and I are around ... we'd probably see see through at that well there's a big marketing campaign behind ... and and my general expenses that said no I ... think that you know easily just going to have a chat like we are and it's like I said yeah you\nDon't get a good conversation with a rape or not you know\nLet's move on the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one business he's trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones\n... is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which the farmers used to see can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and I'm often what kind of people used it\nI guess their primary level we're targeting people here don't have those other ways of communicating with each other so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information the knowledge and how to improve their farmer or a bottle of disease now so we farm we enable those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture and just about any local language for free or ... or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that your technology is very simple technology is SMS does does that ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a message obviously a hundred and sixty car church it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get content people in such a simple format\nAs someone a former U.S as a question for example on on that some us we don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is their intent of the question where are they order the farming\nAnd essentially use that analysis to match them to you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question again not this will come back to the original farmer\nNow you'd you'd go to a million members I think he just signed up a million the million member walk what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people [noise]\nSo it past the million which is as I was a great milestone for us having one point to a million I'm I mean I think the first thing that gets a indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it and even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched\nUm so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month or which you know any context as is probably nearer seven or eight percent on Twitter um you know we know procession within the ...\nWhich gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fund system to use its not a social system its value for their businesses and people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicator would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally out information it's helping save their their livelihoods and farms through before\nIt was an example of how it's been used a ... I mean the example I\nI Would give is that there's a a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called called castle\nHe kept something in the region of of fifty chickens hum as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids to go to school up at dinner and he finally table or on a diseases ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this on we farming or get information back\nAh which vaccines to you is how do I just thought the disease spreading and he managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of light so you know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers that that we found is able to to to provide\nA Kenny you in from we from a Mona El sol are from ... in a special gifts to\nA that was one of those red now public or the positive stories about social media or five years is a guy everyone's social media was going to say the world at once as a positive uses we're all that changed totally\nYes to ... the year we celebrate and social media we thought it's getting to the world ... ... people and a three time regimes to move to towards democracy to mobilize mass as\nIt was the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regimes weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activists real people are very very few\nPeople doing practical things like you have then\nYeah ... exactly will use social campaigns to reasonable over and it's about stuff but\nLater on we started moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefit\nSo it's now a battle between two items the that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to manipulate them so this is why we now we're talking about the negative effects however we cannot forget that social media still can connect people together so have many many many positive effects but of course the perfect and that gets to highlight all that time\nA commercially still very important um I ... it is connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we're getting more good than bad from it\n[noise] uh we're still getting good but we're getting back now and lost seven maybe seven years ago I Would have to do that we're getting all the good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe ... takes over if we couldn't control it ... and make sure it's it's under control maybe we don't know\nOne very brief would use every climbing are you still positive about social media\n[laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think that's a note of goods that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's all we've got five or anything on a positive note thanks to my special guest Mona Eltahawy about from the also the intimate Institute facts does every crime and read the stories in mind that BBC ... flush technology\nAnd they get to join his again in the tech tent at the same time next week [noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
