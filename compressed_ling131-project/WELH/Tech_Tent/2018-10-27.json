if they got to see ads to get it then they want those ads to be rather than he said\nOh this is made the point that Apple's business like many of his rivals doesn't depend on gathering vast amounts of uses data to target them with advertising so you could say it's pretty easy for Mr cook to take a hard line on privacy\nAlex them also use just stepped down is Facebook's chief technology officer was quick to point out the apple doesn't get much privacy to Chinese iPhone users\nWho have bought from instituting a virtual private network to get round censorship\nHe said on Twitter that the media had given Tim Cook an easy ride\nWhich I Want the media to create an incentive structure that AIG news treating Chinese citizens as less deserving of privacy protections\nBecause the c._e._o. is willing

God what are we going to get help ... from his neck Petra sanctions well clearly\nThey will pay it but it's just like chicken and egg ... we need to have lots of electric cars to people who invest in putting in these charges in building the past and then to build the dating not until ... says he's going to sort of cracks us I think\nAnd they need to become affordable which are for ... the the new affordable testimonial phrase about thirty forty thousand dollars which is still pretty chunky still uh it's it's moving in the right direction [noise]\nThis Sunday Brazil goes to the polls to decide between far right candidate ... scenario and the left wing workers' party candidate Fernando had died in the second round of the presidential election it's been a temp pasture his campaign and the key weapon has been the messaging service ... fat\nA BBC investigation uncovered how political campaign has have you software that scrapes Facebook for citizens phone numbers and then ultimately sends them ... ... messages and asked them to ... groups\nJunior underground Yani from BBC News Brazil told me about this investigation and explained to just how important what type has become in Brazil\nLots of is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use watts up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million [noise]\nIt has become and Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them\nOne hypothesis is that this happens because of how ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting the Internet\nData so it's it's a cheap and readily available to and how easy being abused during the present interactions\nSo we found out that there are ... that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then use these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can to send the message is individually about a candidate\nOr when they put people in lots of groups one markets here who I spoke to was told me he would put a a person and a group and the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate and then people would start talking but\nThere were would be to ah people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to leave these people on and make them support the candidate and this is just a little fringe activity or is that an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd lots of has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part uh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use lots up in Brazil and uh the far right candidate presidential candidates said before NATO\nOr who's come pain is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook's rooms in any way well it is against Facebook's rules Facebook said\nThe claims a it is also against a lots of rules and lots of has been a trying to shut down spam accounts for they say they said that they have closed thousands of spine of accounts in Brazil\nAnd the justice system in Brazil or doesn't let a clear if it's a against the law or not\nIt hasn't a written laws thinking about watts up this year until specialist in the electoral justice in Brazil\nOr disagree between what is it legal and what is not we can only say that illegal databases being used to get people's phone numbers that is legal\nThat's Judy on our ground you're only from BBC News Brazil or to ... a special guest um it's it's two years ago that we began not supposed to worry about the impact of social media on of actions with the U.S presidential elections\nUm and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course it works I just keep on ... ringing the alarm bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about it\nWell it sounds to be learning about this coming from old and she is actually but it got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I I think you need to do the same problem which is\nHow our politicians today going to get their messages across to people on campaign the way the wheels socially interact now he's completely tied up with social media ... the politicians are going to do that and then you get these questions of well why did they get the data how were they targeting people the messages\nAre I think things have wants out these wires but he's having conversations if you were a political candidate he would also trying to do that now in this particular case face but it does seem to be the ... Leakey with people's time numbers\nHot but it kindly so they these are all the the question if I was suddenly being added to groups gang well who is this and what not being added to this I think I'd be annoyed\nBut I think there's always a danger of confusing the specifics of highland messed isn't paying but across with what the message is all me if you if you think that the way that campaign to being conducted intended content is a problem I think that's why you need to focus on we've\nSeen more ovens this week that face was not cutting well for instance in sight news the news is sort of a political weapon in the United states more examples of during this ah whole soccer about the caravan of migrants\nBut it's kind of impossible find any for social media because that whole\nModel A's everybody shares and everybody else we don't control the content and so if that sets up whose job is it going to be to say\nWell this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem is an easy answer that you can say that should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to police it well then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we count rate so it is a problem I didn't want answers [noise]\nWell we're going to leave you without announcing that it's a story we've covered the many times on checked and then when we come back to thanks to my social guests to measure how this affects my baby she technology colleague very crime and you can read all of our stories or BBC adult comb fresh technology lots of videos lots of stories\nPlenty plenty of information that I've forgotten during his again in the tech tent\n[noise]\n... river BBC World service from the U.S is made possible by the American public media with support from babble or European made language learning program battled futures practical conversation and Spanish French German and other languages\nA B B.
