I Am I'm willing to talk about anything he wants to look good good here's a flavor of what's coming up about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still aren't registered as being bullied by that fits the stay\nJust about a billion people out there who don't exist basically\nOur research found that video is used to provide a just background noise and and as it turns out a broadcast radio is an excellent way to provide that sort of the same sorts of ambience and does not require at that extra energy that that streaming video does [noise]\nOr to that in a minute now over the past few years we've reported on the huge investments in virtual reality from the likes of Sony Facebook's Oculus division at HCC with its much praise divine system\nBut despite the billions of dollars spent on an overload of marketing sounds of the our headsets approved well pretty disappointing it sees people may be wowed by the experience at first but the Simon seem wears off\nBut then you start up company from Finland aims to change perceptions with a high end headset promising human eye resolution and aimed at business uses\nThe company is ... and the team behind it had worked together the knock your mobile phone business I go to Dan from one of the founders or who come to me\nSo what I'm seeing is an off his studio or it's incredibly realistic it is an eighties as if I'm there which is quite different from a lot of the reality scenarios lots of little models on the on the table and a mess of pain I can see through the ah the windows outside so how did he do this\nWe went to the studio and two two thousand shots of the place in just two hours then a little bit of number crunching on this three D. model came out of it automatically and we made this that you can you can crouch around you can see all sorts of things underneath the table it's like everything's fully three they modeled in here\nOh that's right I'm just moving down now I can see down to the possibility strongly that right in front of me and this this is the paint spices on the bottom of a a little louder\nSo of course the hope here is that it's going to be incredibly easy to do any real world training scenarios I'm now in the\nCockpit of a jets again it's really realistic I can say well the control was in front of me at all to see this as ... applications for training is that right\nYeah what this means in practice and stuff you can skip a lot of the physical full carpet simulators and start doing the training inside a VR now the thing about the areas but you can absolutely see each display each a tax walk in the display seats labels which every element on the plane is conveyed here accurately\nOr have just taken off the headset to to to to ... or ... ... incredibly realistic the virtual reality world assembled a bit lately do you think that realism is going to make a difference\nOh yes for sure my means that reality is that we are off today has been really meant for gaming use cases taking you two different worlds not for actor actual practical purposes of the industry's many companies\nAnd what are some of the suggestions of how we could provide these ditched license teeth\nSo a couple of countries have been quiet quiet von ... is always being held up as being a a shining lights in the the e government will say for many years now in stone yeah\nCitizens have been able to interact with government services electronically and so the percentage of citizens voted in the last election and starting yeah electronically and these are things that we've been thinking about the u._k. for a very very long time in India that got odd ... which is what is the foundation\nWhich they've now registered ... over a billion people a biometric Lee into a into a large government base a base\nUm but on the lower level there's all sorts of solutions coming out which naval bus registrations in registrations that lower level as a company called element that has a phone based registration to where they take\nBabies fingerprints and footprints in order to give them an initial biometric identity and there's a company called sim prince based in Cambridge\nWho use I bought a metric fingers Ghana which they take ... to various places and again use that to to register best now we've heard stories of doctors giving patients to injections for something he should have one because they had no way of knowing that being in the week before but without having ... having any way of identifying them\nThose very very kind of basic problems an average creep in and they can be life threatening\nHe can still identity an ID causing general often feel people with worry about privacy concerns um how can you count today's consent\nWell there are a number of different solutions and and uh I did kind of vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently at a well bank event that I attended looking at digital identities there are people looking at ...\nI'm centralized solutions what well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid ... identities and so on but at the same time that our favorite political for hackers an odd how recently got ... uh again reactor number of times recently got hacked\nAnd that's the system in India was over a billion people people register so absolutely there's concerns they're all\nUm you know some ideas about using cell phones for an identity is way you have you watched entity on your mobile phone\nOnly you hold it and then you can choose who you present that to when you're interacting with the service and that's the way we look at the icy we actually have it on your smartphone so it's actually held by you rather than being held in the central place that can be hacked\nBut at the moment there's a number of different solutions to the vying for a time um but the centralized ones which is the most common at the moment all the most vulnerable\nThat's Ken Banks now what have you done to minimize your carbon footprint and use less energy costs out ed travel perhaps so make your home more energy efficient but maybe you should also consider giving up Netflix Amazon Prime video another on demand video services\n... video streaming now accounts for the majority of global Internet traffic which in turn is consuming ever more electricity and finding out more\nAlexa turn the heat down to sixteen
