making this program is tied to people from some of the world's most respected NGOs to criticize the ban in private\nBut nothing public [noise] so this week we're waiting until the ... debate asking is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise]\nHot one lifting that by then\n[laughter]\nI had the chance to do some traveling in college and I think was exposed to children shining shoes selling newspapers in the streets and it wasn't until I continued my studies that it really dawned on me that what I was witnessing was child labor\n[noise]\nThat's Benjamin Smith senior office if a child labor at the eye and the international Labour organization that part at the un it's the driving force behind the international ban on child labor which it defines as\nWork that jeopardizes children's development and future\nAnd there are two parts to this one which found what's known as the west forms of child labor\nSlavery use of children in prostitution pornography these have children in illicit activities like drug trafficking and then hazardous work that jeopardizes the health and safety or morals of children\nThat's the uncontroversial parts of the ban in almost two hundred countries have signed up to it wants to base it is the age of which children should be allowed to do what it isn't considered hazardous most government typically to set the minimum age at Fifteen or fourteen for some developing countries\nWhen the family needed more money she take more time of school so she could and mow and when they finally moved to follow the crops she'd move with them [noise]\nOne you should change school full time and she did bugging her exams but through it till she thought this was normal it wasn't until the filmmaking made a documentary about her she realized she was different from other kids\nAnd to see a room filled with about Fifteen hundred people and they're all looking at your story is mind bottling it was crazy that I was bringing awareness to something that I didn't even know was a problem and that and that's when I realized\nThat it was a problem in that way I was living was not the way everyone loved\nThat was the first time she has the tongue child labor and she realized it describes a that was seven years ago now she has made it to university which she's an activist on child labor campaigning and supported the ban\nI definitely feel like children shouldn't be able to work until the ages at least the sixteen I think this is dangerous for the safety of these children in their education and I know there's a lot of people like me out there\nAre some people say well surely it's who writes if you'll if someone goes to school and just started a couple of hours in the evenings or perhaps a couple of hours that we can to help get them income would not be All right [noise] uh [noise] it's\nDifferent every debatable I Know these families want their children and worked to bring some income in but they're just hindering their education and I think that these families also need to find a different way to get around their situation\nDo you think you would have been able to go to school if you and your siblings hadn't worked\nOh absolutely my two younger sisters still live at home\nThey've never felt like they've had to go out in the field to wear enough because you know my family moved on to a different type of job that provided more for us\nSo it sounds like you're saying it's almost as though you need to protect these children from bad choices they might make for the best reasons right\nI feel like these children shouldn't feel obligated does that make sense [noise]\nIt does make sense [noise]\nWhen the lender was little she felt she had to what she felt responsible even at the age of seven\nAnd so she says most should be done to lift that responsibility of the shoulders of children like come\nOn to the parents to find another way to ban helps do that that ...\nThat the some of the poorest families in the world that is no other way [noise]\n\nHot for book we can and cannot do\n\n\nWe have been able to have to be created religious which have been trying to leave a free by addressing all of the issues in the video conferencing men are just possible to create communities really spoke to do me a bit of two didn't seem\nShould be working on child labor issues in India for the past ... years and she's now director of advocacy and fundraising it's concerned for wasn't children as a charity the bucks in Bangalore charging that says the ban on child labor isn't working\nThere is a lot of pressure in countries like mine to insist that is No Child labor anymore in most sectors certainly an export sector is the idea is to say that these products are clean they're not touched the hands of child labor\nBecause if that scene that's connected with child labor they weren't guess any money for them they won't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't even acknowledge their presence\nSo when the authorities come across child labor as she says that instead of helping them they want them to dissipate in\nAnd your children the phones looking the state's response is come in white ... put them in and take them over ... ... homes where they looked up that you know the way from their families and the state cause the family and there isn't the charge would never ever be seen like this again\nAnd when they're released most of the children go back to work because the problems that drove them to work in the first place I haven't been solved and this is what could be threatened his organization comes and they meet child labor is an advantages and often than not that parents why they want\nSome talks about the whole meal they get to the factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school others said they have to look up the younger siblings so fetch water all of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey are not willing to transfer the burden on to the family for instance if they ever fishing water they will not okay with seeing that your mother fish water and you'd be in school because they were seeing my mother has a lot to do already\nThey have to find solutions that wouldn't put more pressure on their parents and so it could be threatened us charity tend to what's known as the punt chance India's local councils\nAnd a lot of the work of my organization has been to walk with these local governments with children sitting with them and the solutions in one case can be a scholarship for the child who has no money\nIt could be more funding for childcare so children don't have to come to the younger siblings\nIn other cases of each year for another child in other kids it can be getting electricity for ... which don't have it and that is how\nWe were able to create tried labels free communities that a country like India\nAnd by labor free and she doesn't mean these are communities when no children what she means is that what they're doing now along the interface school like\nType ... and she says somewhat can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks for school uniform so what about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with that we talked to children and actually come up with a document\nCalled work we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids said if you're milking walked accord jealousy coast which are believed to implement and which are very happy kicking they said nobody should be doing it because it's harmful look it's dangerous\nOf lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments they find out what the children want some like being exhausted by hours of household chose to spend to al it's working for a local shop others might choose factory work as a milking a temperamental Jersey cow\nIt's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to meet the right decision for themselves I'm yet to find\nSo I did that a child to perhaps continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that finally\nWe have to give that child that choice in fact this kind of work actually increases are responsibilities India working with children die that Lee you don't let them take that one decision and then forget them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life [noise]\nThen I was watching the children's council throughout banged a little time consuming and expensive\nBut it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise] the I Know the organization behind the global ban says no children enjoy such an age should never what\nWe heard about the unintended consequences children pushed into more dangerous why call looked down by the authorities debate that will continue but when you take a step back it's clear that the argument isn't just about policy\n[noise] it's about something more fundamental some\nKicks in West child under assassinate you what is by definition being exploited others say a child should have the right to walk\nAnd that's what makes it so hard to know what's right\n[noise]\nDancer doesn't lying on definition of child labor it's about ...\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\nThis inquiry was presented by me having to marry ... and ... my best to take a sentence and if you want to listen to more episodes
