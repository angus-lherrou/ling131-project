World Service with me had an American each week one question for expert witnesses\nAnd denounce [noise]\nIt's a sunny morning in Texas ... Wang is working to what she's going to find [noise]\nShe opens the door to her not inside tens of thousands of one's regarding around in different books [noise]\nShe kids into one another and slugging it dawned on him [noise] what she's seen could help children must have been a taking condition known to us aging [noise]\nDiseases related to aging ... hundred thousand people every day\nBut a growing number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way\nOr the past few years research to carry that remarkable experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how life than\nThe ... of dollars are being spent all over the wealth in essence to extend on line\nAnd this week we bring you some of the world's leading was sent it to tell me what they found [noise]\nYou'll find out what ... Wang discovered with her once in a one scientist was dusty aging process in our cells\nAs we answer a question that own if you had probably ... [noise]\nHow long can we live [noise]\nHeart one\nIt's all in this case\n[noise] we're having\nExpectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to we were born right on the spot in history [noise]\nHow fast thanks that witness cool Christians [noise] what does it don't sense and then ... then one day decided he had enough in treating ... he now runs the Danish aging was set sentence while he's trying to tell people getting in the last place we [noise]\nWe all know what age ... from the outside [noise] what is actually due to a ...\nWell it's accumulation of damage from the molecular level that didn't spread to the\nCells and tissues and organs and to the whole organism and it's kind of all the hits that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging\nStocks and when does it all began when do we stop to decline that is in the mid thirties they start to ask so I'm thirty seven seven is ... yeah now deposits thought Oh thanks for the good news [laughter] sorry\nAnd there's more bad news once we start to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice as dangerous being forced you to compare to thirty five then again it's twice its dangers being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year and then their mortality\nRisk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying is about fifty sixty percent\nSo if you really optimistic type and you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\nAnd when you're thinking about these islands that's a lot stacked against him when you age as your molecules tissues and organs get tired and damaged susceptible to a whole range of diseases\nCardiovascular disease cancer ... Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease or lung disease all the major ones as well as the more kind of non specific you know people get more frail less resilient\nAnd sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play that important to keep U.S House the\nMain one wanted to know whether a micro biome has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three weeks so that makes them want it for a modest puff subject yeah [noise]\n\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the worms micro biome would it live longer [noise]\n\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside a ... gun tweaked its genes to make different varieties and then sent them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the worms expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find in feel cases anymore not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he just totally unexpected and how long\nDid some of the ... about fifty percent longer fifty percent yet that's extraordinary so you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that lives fool four and a half\nFour and high school yes I'm was that much more than you would have expected yes I think scientists sometimes\nWe do research it's kind of like gambling [laughter] so we have some crazy idea than you know wait wait this ... way to test them but you never know why they are idea is ride around\nAnd those moments where you find that rates out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different micro biome give worms will Tony a longer life with a better quality of life in their final days\nSo they're way with the right way can look at how well they if they have when they're older because worm when they're getting older their physical activity has declined so they move slower and also become a little bit of a card in it [noise]\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ones [noise] and she's right you can tell their own wild younger ones regal energetically around and the older ones move slowly in the skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they showed rank house but it can tell that body structure is not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new microbiomes most any wrinkles around will quickly and their old age\nBut they were less susceptible to disease to [noise] main one is now carrying out tests on mice to see where the changing them like ... extends then life and so there's a chance that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same\nFor us some of my colleagues say okay you know I think people can live to ... say ...\nWhy aren't jak for me is already the ... [noise] so how long can we live full [noise]\nWe had about ... to get us to a hundred and says he finds [noise]\nAnd how it different micro biome ... give us fifty percent more time on us\nBases inventions or a bounce addressing the symptoms of aging ... to ... [noise] well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nHeart for\nFighting you're so by ...\nOh\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that loan Harry's professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientists to walk on aging is because a lot of people excited\nBefore now it's a little bit of ... and I failed now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them that I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nHow ... begins with the building blocks of all these cells\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues are made of different types of cells now cells get told that some cells and say you live or your kidneys or whatever will be dividing to replace some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would ... and\n... comes from the ... which means to grow old and that's exactly what's happening to these cells they've grown old income to the end of that life cycle but instead of dying they hung around acting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence file will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells ran them so it's almost like a self saying I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... does well\nWow so it's almost sort of contaminating them with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around as ...\nAs we grow older more and more of a cells becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\n\nWill send you do they make the cells around them HPV Austin these innocent sounds stop functioning as they should which is still to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension ... type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Henry's wants to know whether she could get these sounds just don't behaving like a little cells behave more like young one\nHappened that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was still finding a seats and we have some old south and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to see\nThat they would still like also said they look kind of lacy under a microscope and we have a particular die that we can put on I fell coaches the tens blue if that's in essence so when I was expecting to see is that the south would be so blue and still looking old and she will they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south\nTo professor Harry said oh no you've got the wrong side of these young sales go through it again and\nThat and she did and she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it said that that it's probably ...\nHow many rogue city services are probably about nine she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're on to somebody\nPossible she'd effectively rejuvenated old thousand ten men too young so\nAnd they just want to loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the well is the first experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nSo when it comes to a lifespan think loan Harry's would be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nOf human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up paying\nYou the new generation of empty degenerative drugs with sort of way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping is that this would allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once say that people he would have died at age will then go on to live than not loaded lifestyle\nSo how long can we name [noise] well we know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song\nAnd from what we've cut that steak is lucky to ride with the discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace a damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro buying it still sounds aging how many years ...
