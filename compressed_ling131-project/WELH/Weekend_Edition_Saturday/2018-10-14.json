weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke Garcia Navarro good morning everyone and massive relief effort is under way in the Florida Panhandle to help communities that were hit hard by hurricane Michael pucker elementary school just outside Panama City National Guard troops handed out water and ready to eat meals to vaccines\nWe cannot because we've heard out they were passing out food like all the help we can get I'm Alive\nBy ... by bite at a time it's the most devastated I've ever been the most blessed I've ever felt all my children survived all my grandchildren survive will say well where he felt will be good\nRob an ad hoc of Springfield and Sally half Callaway, Florida to communities that were particularly hard hit when the eye of hurricane Michael pass through joining with the latest on the relief effort is NPR's Joel Rose and Miramar Beach Florida good morning highly live\nYou've been in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're seeing\nGetting underway now at least in and around Panama City it took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground but I really saw difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard of the top\nBut that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast started it a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland and there are very long lines for supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nYeah and the pictures of devastation or are incredible how much does it still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nYeah there are still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week\nBut that estimate does not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months just driving around in Panama City I mean it's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there's no water nominee gas stations are open the ones that do have gas have really long lines so I think things are going to be pretty rough year for the foreseeable future\nSays Joel what are people telling you they're going to do with it and stick it out are they going to leave\nI think a lot of people may not have any choice I mean both in an around Panama City and out in the countryside it's one of the poorest regions of Florida are places where people a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck\nAnd so you know right now a lot of the people I've talked to her are focused on just getting through today and tomorrow you know tried to get water and ice trying to get a a tarp to cover up the hole in the roof maybe before it rains um although luckily there's no rain in the immediate forecasts but you know that's where people's minds are\nYeah we've heard there were really big problems also with communications is that getting any better\nOr not that I've seen most cell carriers are still down around Panama City I mean many even emergency officials don't have phones that work [noise] um so you know it's a big problem people can call their relatives to say they're okay I'm at and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down the rescue and relief effort\n\nSupport for

Navarro\nThe terms of less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the G O P is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so Ken Democrats cut into the geo piece edge among governors\nHaven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American mayor of from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they're sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's we're always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding and you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican\nKris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and terrorists is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans and how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland is Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip the seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you\nSo much thank you abolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists had won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants in their jails for the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\nThat cats from member station WNYC reports\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned it into a political firestorm\nTo the issue was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement\nThe agency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nBecause you'd night you can you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get this\nThing down here and I think ... we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five tense hours Hudson County voted to end the eyes contract but not until twenty twenty that way the county would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nYou all democratic board of ... as the county legislators in New Jersey are known assured residents that action would be taken here's Anthony Romano\nIs a strong possibility we will be phased out of this\nSo it's not just rhetoric\nAcross the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice in Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants\nAnd then it led to the mayor issued an executive order to stop accepting ice detainees but all of this is not happening without push back\nYour job then they tax day in a town\nYou've on balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences Ryan ... represents immigrants at the jail pro bono\nFamilies and lawyers and their community are here and the separation from those resources is critical to an enabling detainees

is a common sense\n[noise] people who are lucky to have them or using gas powered generator utility crews to solve a downfall and wires and restore their electricity they county emergency services chief Mark Bowden says that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground that across the\n... says Scott errands and at the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to be do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten said they'd accept a twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but\nThere are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult Julie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and your dad can actually be much more cost me take my masters and ... ... and an overhead wire\nMcNamara says in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more of is independent micro grids with solar power and batteries at places like water treatment plants hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to meet their standards giant chain of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population it keep the light ... even if the broader\nMcNamara was lead author of twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change that's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries\nJeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's election closed in Florida we know Florida has a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season market pseudo covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nDriving me so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or might just over a year ago he's seen a lot of storms comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now if there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs\nAnd then all of the associated\nDestructive ... that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of many signs of human habitation construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson and a charismatic mayor of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat and ...\nCongressman um who also has a lot of support and pockets of a Florida you know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likeliest scenario is that this has probably been to a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over all both physically in these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a ... leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott as governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he was an executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee the mayor\nBut it was hit pretty hard it was hit yeah a ... Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the uh the the county of Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent run the Centers for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seen a visibly\nIn in one case actually chainsaw in trees away [laughter] and\nI'm moving debris really so he's changed trees he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who's just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone thought to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen or what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they are going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle it'd be almost impossible pull right now 'cause you can't get a hold of a half you know eating in a sense of the people\nThat's political as my computer joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after a big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be at the height of their political power but will that change after November tuned in to MORNING EDITION to hear what's at stake for the GOP and their majorities in Congress you can ask\n'em you can listen by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your member station ...\nHere's the chain of department stores has been a part of American culture for a hundred and twenty five years the commercials from my childhood set it off\nThe yarn [laughter]\n\nI won't be able to get that out of my head now but the auto center hardware appliance and clothing store is approaching\nThe end of its long slow decline Sears Holdings the company that owns the years and I should say Kmart needs to pay back a hundred and thirty four million dollars of debt by tomorrow or face bankruptcy Jay Hancock is a senior Stan and historian and he joins us now\nHow are you feeling about this notion that as I said Sears has been struggling for a while the smartest deadline looks the icing apartheid that it's big lenders are pushing for liquidation yeah\nIt's um it's sort of sad really uh it's Sears is an American institution you know I was listening to the commercial you were just playing and it brought back memories for me as well I mean I think that's really a big part of the the staying power is it it's sort of nostalgic for older generations\nI mean I grew up in the seventies and Sears was still you know a gargantuan at that point a lot of people would say that that was sort of their pinnacle or the sixties and seventies the post World War two era\nOn trial Snyder with these headlines\nSaudi Arabia is threatening to retaliate after President Trump warned of a severe punishment of Saudi Arabia is found to have been involved in the disappearance of journalist ... the government issued a statement today after the Saudis stock market plunged drop warned of consequences suited interview with CBS is sixty minutes\nMany among the crowd packed into St Peter's Square today we're from El Salvador they traveled around watched Pope Francis canonize obscene archbishop Oscar Romero\nRomero was proclaimed to St alongside pope pope is six and several others and Somalia is marking the first anniversary of the deadliest terrorist attack in the country's history of bombing in the center of Mogadishu that killed nearly six hundred people a year ago\nOn trial Snyder NPR News from Culver City\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and do your screener questions to build their short list of preferred candidates learn more it indeed dot com slash higher\nFrom American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build them or just an equitable world learn more at AJ W.

heard out they were passing out food and they all the help we can get\nI'm Alive and kicking families where I was seven at times I came in and out of a wide at a time it's the most devastated I've ever been the most blessed I've ever felt all my children survived all my grandchildren survive will say well rebuilt will be good\nRobin and ... of Springfield and Sally half Callaway, Florida to communities that were particularly hard hit when the eye of hurricane Michael pass through starting with the latest on the relief effort is NPR's Joel Rose in Myanmar Beach Florida the morning Hi Lulu\nI he's been in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're seeing\nWell ... it feels like the relief effort really is getting underway now at least in and around Panama City it took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground\nBut I really saw difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard at the top\nBut that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast is drawn to that a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland and there are very long lines for supplies all over the region lots of people\nRon credible and much of this is still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nYeah they're still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week\nBut that estimate does not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months just driving around in Panama City I mean it's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there's no water nominee gas stations are open the ones that do have gas have really long lines so I think things are gonna be pretty rough year for the foreseeable future\nSays Joel what are people telling you they're going to deal with it and stick it out or are they going to leave\nI think a lot of people may not have any choice I mean both in and around Panama City and out in the countryside is one of the poorest regions of Florida are places where people a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck\nAnd just you know right now a lot of the people I've talked to her are focused on just getting through today and tomorrow you know trying to get water an ice trying to get a tarp to cover up the hole in the roof maybe before it rains um although luckily there is no rain in the immediate forecasts but you know that's where people's minds are\nYeah we've heard there were really big problems also with communications is that getting any better\nOr not that I've seen I most cell carriers are still down around Panama City I mean many even emergency officials don't have phones that work um so it you know it's a big problem people can call their relatives to say they're okay I'm at and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down the rescue and relief effort\nLater today this afternoon at one on the public radio eighty nine point three FM\nSupport for NPR

Navarro\nThe midterms are less than a month's away voters will decide on the makeup of the Senate the house and many will also choose governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the geo Pete is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors\nHave a really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be a sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they\nControlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to drop congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple estates\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think are really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's the state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by Pfizer for education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican polarizing nominees France is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary\nHealth care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont spills\nCould flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you [noise]\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the call gain traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants in their jails to the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency that cats in the position WNYC reports\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned it into a political firestorm\nTo the issue was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement\nThe agency pays the county to house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees activists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nBecomes a huge night you can you do have power and it may not be a lot and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get it sitting\nDown here and I think Audi we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five tense hours Hudson County voted to end the ice contract but not until twenty twenty that way the county would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice\nYou all democratic board a free holders as the county legislators in New Jersey are known assured residents that action would be taken here's Anthony Romano\nIs a strong possibility we will be phased out of this\nSo it's not just rhetoric\nAcross the country local officials are responding to anti ISIS activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of Santa Ana I pulled out of their contracts with ice in Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants\nAnd then it led to the mayor issued an executive order stop accepting ice detainees\nBut all of this is not happening without push back\nYour job then it down to what\nYou've on balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences Ryan ... represents immigrants at the jail pro bono\nFamilies and lawyers and their community are here and the separation from those resources is critical to enabling detainees actually win their cases they remain permanently in the United states or have released on bond\nVersus the detainees should be allowed to stay in New Jersey near their families and lawyers unlike in other parts of the country immigrants jailed in Hudson County or eligible for free legal representation\nThe free holders did agree to try to improve conditions for immigrants before the end of the contract the gel has been plagued by problems suicides poor medical care bad food several former detainees testified at the hearing last week\nThough with the law is ...\nBy other detainees Joel director who was also at the meeting said he would investigate ... that's not enough you're the legislators to end the ice contract no for NPR News I'm not touch\nBoth\n[noise]\nTwenty one year
