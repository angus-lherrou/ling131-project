altered cash and broke out according to the official count\nEighteen people have been arrested in the case then crown prince Mohammed bin saw him on purged two of his advisors or which had to be linked to the operation\nPresident Trump called the Saudis statement credible a good first step but key members of Congress from both sides of the aisle questioned the Saudi account which is at odds with a Turkish explanation that says\nThere was a Saturday hit team with a bone saw and a plan to kill ... with us this morning as NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia for years ... thanks so much for being with us the money you have seen this outage statement what does it tell you about how the kingdom mishandling crush\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that\nPlaces blame on senior advisors none of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership fail to confirm has that earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is how one Saudi defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of his whereas Mr ...\nIndeed so the Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local Turk for disposal\nTurkish authorities I have been just continuing this investigation and now it's in a forest near the you know the consulate so the official account doesn't explain why uh

has been documented by the New York times and the Washington Post\nAnd the Turks leak those names\nIn the run up to the official account which was made public on Saudi TV early this morning there's been this online army of Saudi social media box\nA it's a smear campaign against a show gee I'm there's another hash tag that says we all trust Mohammed bin sell them on that began trending on Twitter Twitter is hugely popular in the kingdom and you have to read it to see what's going on internally\nAccording to the question has to be rich how could an operation on the scale take place without explicit knowledge from the top including the crown prince themselves or and or can you see any signs ever will be consequences for the crown prince\nAt the moment no what's happened is the king has

Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience just as Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh for trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in ... in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen\nWhich by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there was a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries on to a point of a value on that is not the most effective lights\nMoral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey that Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn around elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests are and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo I'd thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage there practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find\nWays to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we named top two weeks\nIs unacceptable even ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nThat American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joins us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation in such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counter terrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented\nYeah you're right in the article that the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks\nThose have been replaced by just the targets are people\nAnd we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is mhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries I see no there's not many other names for them the N. word definitely works in this case\nThey were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed a by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty fifty\nThese special forces or an unsealed veterans maybe feel veterans'\nDeployed on a mission to kill the leader of the aid and branch of al Islam\nAnd all those lives I write is very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this\n... are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you suggest in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was so you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\nAnd I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can and listened foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French uh I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on a lot of lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War II sure right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um is this an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it I'm either at our American\nShows and the ones in rather American people believe you've uncovered yet right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it and\nI've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working a secret service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons one is a there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he is doing U.S policy of the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we saw them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir arguments they're doing what the you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they've they suggest you which patriotism yes is Aaron ... investigative reporter for buzzfeed thanks so much for being with us thank you so much\nWho are [noise]\nA joyous Snyder with these

just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week\nIt included a photo of a smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for Matty but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and ... the high school party\nA drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and Lynch in near died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato needles wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Burlington thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nA ... real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really loved the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrug ... more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and such and not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted now um we carried out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think are what are your hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one phase of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack\nMatty didn't resemble that photo\nAnd so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for Maddie on Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course they'll be performances and we actually have\nA video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen table will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat Bonnie

in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of the story the Saudis have now banned\nIt's intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual and that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while\nHe was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what his focus\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out his agenda like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about Kavanaugh
