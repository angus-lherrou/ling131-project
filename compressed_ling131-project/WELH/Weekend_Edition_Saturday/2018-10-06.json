we're waiting for the Senate to vote for Brett Kavanaugh looks to be headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected to submit to conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning but now we can both name conservative justices Souter Stevens Blackmon Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations couldn't\nYes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to name to Bush you know to by Donald Trump will be around for some time and this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who has been which has been a growing force in the courts\nIt's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\n... what do we need to know about the federalist society especially as they're going to be um more prominent than ever and us life\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Google's legal scholars\nAre people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy above few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscored there's nothing remotely secret about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get up to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut Mitt terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms\nI'm now it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in in the surveys you mentioned unemployment is at a three point seven percent are historically low about a forty year low\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from universal pictures presenting the new film first men from Damien ... director of la la land and whiplash and starring Ryan Gosling

Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian bus before now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh wars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also you need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised\nInformation about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contact with the committee for her you know and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she's energy from Christian bus you forward a sincere\nUh but that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support rent a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nAnd you know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time and there's an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you'd end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have necessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my cupboards the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this ... neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy and being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise]\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it's it's way worse than what ... making the cardinals thanks so much thank you [noise]\nTo\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations just jumble Bryan who's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course he's your jacket bitter Bloomberg opinion Tim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily the head or of this one I don't think that's a news though\nI think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth for about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump passed on several hundred million dollars to his children he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance and gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid or\nBillion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald ... over the years I've dealt with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing for low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of\nNew numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is the president is set on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognizing that maybe people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when Fred Trump and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that\nThe Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pockets of differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and he he earned his living on his own\nRather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nTim

Cheney intends to vote for judge capital\nIt's devastating but it's honestly not safer surprising\nWell yeah it's been indicated also I mean Donald Trump got sixty eight point five percent of the presidential vote in West Virginia in twenty sixteen can the argument being made that senator Manchin is just reflect in the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nPeople mostly most people supported cabinet here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he is under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base yeah\nWell but when you choose a politician to being a politician is though that's not much of a surprise visit there I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did do that to him yesterday on Thursday\nWe'll tell her tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office on Monday and they were actually arrested a\nHit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday that didn't really go well\nSo on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had probably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of sexual assault and ask\nThem how they plan to vote and he their way he he was very engaging the conversation he had to step out of the room but did it I got back from like ... you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely engaged she asked a lot of question um I Do believe that Joe mansion cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes your continue if the judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers are doing\nOur does continue to sell uh as far as the Senate go eat it he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had it because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis\nAnd so he kinda jury doesn't believe in opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and he's just a bad guy and I think he knows\nThat I ... can't though this is your opinion with me underscore that\nDo of course this is my opinion yes of course um\nSo yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue yeah so we're
