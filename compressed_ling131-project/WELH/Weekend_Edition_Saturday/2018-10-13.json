yesterday to member station W. K. juicy\nWe're working on getting water here we are working on getting food here they need to let these people are working very hard to determine where the leaks are to repair them so we can have water again sit at our toilets slash working on getting port a potties out we understand the basic needs\nHundreds of thousands are without power from the Florida Panhandle into Virginia the storm is no blamed for at least fourteen debts NPR's Joel Rose is in Miramar Beach Florida Joel thanks for being with us as to what is the situation seem like today\nAs you mentioned there are lots of folks without power and the situation seems particularly dire in Panama City and some of the smaller towns in Bay county along the Gulf of Mexico there in Panama City there's no water no power no gas\nAnd as you head out of town to find the stations that do have gas there very long lines many folks have evacuated from this region but for those who stayed behind it's getting increasingly difficult just to find the basics like to find food and and to find water\nAnd you were in Panama City yesterday I gather which which is like there\nIt's a small city about thirty seven thousand residence 'em before the storm on it's on the bay it's not directly on the Gulf of Mexico it's not all the jury's town I mean the houses are set pretty close together\nAnd right now it's like every block is is that almost like a scene from a disaster movie like their trees down there are wires in the street seems like every building sustained some kind of damage\nOr either to the roof or to the walls I mean I saw it as a church that was missing two of its walls and and you could just see from the pews right out into the the blue sky outside um churches schools public buildings hospitals all of this as a stand a lot of damage\nA and I think it's starting to really dawned on folks to this is going to be a very long recovery\nRight now fourteen the gesture fourteen people have been reported and confirmed but I gather nobody there thinks that's that's the final word\nUnfortunately no I mean I I think people do think that the death toll is likely to rise up so far officials here have been pretty tight lipped they don't want to release numbers until they finished the search and rescue process a bay county emergency chief mark Boleyn was asked yesterday about the number of fatalities here's what he said\nWhat we have is a lot of people missing I Want to be very careful about numbers because are they missing because their loved ones can't contact them or are they missing because they were you know perished in the store\nAnd when he says loved ones are missing or can't contact them it's a it's true that cell phones are not working very well not only in Panama City but all over bay county so it remains really difficult to communicate and find relatives who may have stayed behind in the storm\nBut still you do get the feeling that the number of fatalities is going to go up and maybe way up when we start to get more information from the waterfront communities\nOr you know to the south and east of Panama City places like Springfield Parker Mexico beach in Port saint Joe that were really

first\nPennsylvania was detailed and a nine hundred page report in August that outlines sexual abuse by priests in ... is over which were presided\nHe was also accused of covering up allegations against his predecessor D.C.'s cardinal Theodore ... character who resigned from the College of cardinals earlier this year\nThese are unsettling time for many of us Catholics no ... is a young man who grow up in Pennsylvania in one of Donald worlds diocese and moved to Washington DC this summer he joins us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your faith which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and\nMost of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person and I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out this summer about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these Paris is that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my faith in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know any\nNo I Do not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with\n[noise] do you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops than people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they spent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to see the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for\nThe heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person I Am\nAnd that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever was involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area since starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I\nStill have a face and I just see much less of the connection between my personal faith and the Catholic Church\n... now of Washington DC thanks for speaking with us in such

you so much for wanting to talk to you\n[noise] when someone says do you tell me about your mother it's not a simple question is\nUh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother's a credible model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch jihadists\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but that rarely practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\n[noise] well um [noise] and we do have to get to that the only answer\nTo the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to uh with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looked at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town with her partner also started to get progressive worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the beat in June to or from your mother the beatings that she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that is as I say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just dramatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I thing led to mean eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of\nReally big women's had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAny individual you started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and is sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of run ins with police as I get kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear enough thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nMan I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleeping in a row from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino\nIt's harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about a new book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWhile I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to eat right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the white told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely like trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you hear what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be\nA writer read or a teacher and my mother and not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing to say\nAnd I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this book\nHere say lemon his book heavy than American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for having me\n\nWhen George ... is

Virginia resident and you're right there are a number of things that we could do I'll tell you what I focus on the first thing the Senate did this week the members of the Foreign Relations committee

to put sanctions on individuals if they gauge and human rights abuses when we send the letter it triggers a hundred and twenty day investigative period where the administration has to report back to

and working to potentially these arms sales to them we had a vote a few months ago were forty seven of us\nVoted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of their mishandling of the civil war in Yemen and the massive humanitarian crisis there so a second thing that you are likely to see I think Senator Paul and Murphy have talked about this\nIs additional action to block arms sales President Trump reacted very negatively that the other day you'll see that and then the final one is us support for the for the Saudis and the UAE the war in Yemen and I think there is increasingly a desire to just a cease us support\nFor the war in Yemen which is a massive humanitarian disaster so I think before we get into embassy diplomatic relations we've had a long standing relationship with Saudi

hundred miles from anything and that's why we're here we like it it's a lovely wonderful camp that people have to get here\nAfter hurricane Michael accessibility was a problem the storm surge washed out entire sections of the main coastal road highway Ninety eight it also temporarily forced the closure of a bridge that leads Appalachian coal live with its neighbor East Point now the bridges

Florida\nIn Georgia a number of civil rights groups you're showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the region or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically it works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a high Finn or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens then the application is ...\nStraight from us but I Want to make something really clear and all of this is the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people\nFrom voting yeah and of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making well the group's\nPoint out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race hasn't it\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis\nBut for both candidates motivating the base is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so that's all about who's going to actually show up\nJohnny
