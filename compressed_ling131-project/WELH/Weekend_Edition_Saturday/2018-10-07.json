Senate from judge Brett Kavanaugh\n\nThe president at a rally last night in Kansas will hear more about that elsewhere in the show but let's begin this hour with Molly ball she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent he Molly Hi ah so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrats as sort of weapon I think the me too movement for political gain\nAnd on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women an al ... a sitting Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country\nLike a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI\nAnd that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to use an analogy\nI you thought you know I think people were already angry but the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions are and how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh\nUh left that was already a quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nAnd I on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is now closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] just close to an election it's it's hard to tell what signal and what is noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national\nSentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said a those statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to regain the upper hand\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from universal pictures presenting the new film

weekend edition from NPR News I'm Garcia Navarro\nKevin ... is now an associate justice of the Supreme Court like having a confirmation fight is however but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it ... it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time as senator stood\nAt their desks and formally voted on cabin on vice president Mike Pence presided protester after protesters stood up and yelled raw visceral messages stir mansion [noise]\n\nCircles has been seen some of the cabinet confirmations a Senate taking on one of its most important in historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural reckoning with sexual assault before the vote majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer sounded like they were in agreement road\nThat led us here has been bitter angry and partisan\nA vote to confirm drug Scott ... is a vote to end this brave dark chapter in the center for\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged and agreed but for very different reasons Republicans sock character assassination old unproven allegations designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation when the grams diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations some of the\nBest I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most ethical sham since I've been in politics\nDemocrats like New York's Kirsten Gillibrand soft Ford's claim Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school at the combination of the year old me too movement a referendum on whether women are believe when they report harassment or assault\nWe allow women's experiences sexual trauma second to a man's promotion it will not only diminish this watershed moment a societal change we are as it will bring shame and it's funny\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor forwards sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as the confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing\nBecame a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that and she explained why she was the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh\nAs a legislative French we have an obligation a moral obligation to do better than it\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirm Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford and other brave women who came forward and you want to vindicate their sacrifice vote\nRepublicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post the whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh for energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle\nThere's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll\nAll suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked\nAbout the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers\nGay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin other places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new world look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen\nYears or so and that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power\nOr not NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us so very much thank you my\nName's Nicole ... who was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted\nBy a white couple when she was an infant her\nParents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it was attributed to God or to fate you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be\nBecause the story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can never know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity\nGrowing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race I think it was something that my family\nDidn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate treat you as was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that defined what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance and beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between\nMy experience as a Korean American and my parents' experience as white Americans I really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge and if I tell them they might not understand anyway\nBecause their weight [noise] so you started to think about this experience and eventually when you get older you decided to go in search of your birth family as an adult ... what what made you do that\nMix of shutting clouds today ties in the upper seventies\nUm trials Snyder with these headlines President Trump is calling Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court a tremendous

Saudi Arabian journalist at the Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia are at odds on the world stage and the accusation by Turkish investigators that Washington Post contributor ... was killed inside the Saudi conflict has ratcheted up regional tensions\nThe Saudis have strongly denied the allegation NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul now to sort through this story I'm good morning Hi Lulu\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know democracy ... walked into the Saudi conflict Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to a pending marriage to his Turkish fiance a she waited for him outside holding his phone until well after the consulate closed a says he never came out\nA Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record by an advisor to president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate are aired on says he said that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far\nAnd we haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that the show he is dead just the persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\n... what is the Saudis and saying\nWell the Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that the show you did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon or the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very keen to know what happened to him a there is no evidence on the outside whoever to show that she'll be actually did leave the consulate\nUh the consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of the show he said that constantly has multiple exits but why would they show the leave by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting up front\nSo lots of questions this advisor to president air to one says he's convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in Istanbul on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show the either inside or leaving the council\nAlright two questions in the first one is um why is this important what does this mean for Saudi relations with turkey and with other world powers\nWell it could be very important but a lot of depend on what we learn from here on about to show these disappearance what happened to him and\nIt seems likely to be further blow to Saudi turkey ties are relations were already strained Turkey's been siding with another Persian Gulf states Qatar and a bitter dispute with the Saudis\nAre some are wondering what the American response is going to be a ... an important ally to the U.S does turkey has so far officials said only they're aware and following the situation closely so if there is any pressure from the Trump Administration it it's not happening in public\nEye and why would show the last three have been on someone's list them and why is he someone that is of interest\nThat is a very good question to show his writings have sometimes been critical of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but not in any particularly radical way he prays almonds reforms like allowing women to drive and then he criticized

Kavanaugh was sworn in as the newest associate justice of the U.S Supreme Court Trump was off to pick up and the camera keys traveled with the president and joins us now good morning Tam good morning\nAt this rally was on the schedule before the final cabinet vote in fact the president watched it from air force one you were there time what was the reaction on the plane\nYeah he wanted the reporters who were on the plane to watch him watching the final tally come in and he gave a thumbs up\nAfter that he took some questions and a reporter asked him what message she had for the women out there who were devastated feeling devastated by this result and President Trump said that he didn't think there were any women like that\nI feel we're in many ways wrong\nA lot of women voters anyway\nThat's uh an echo of something that he said at a rally last week at in Mississippi a rally where he turned on Christine Blasey Ford and and really went after her and attacked her for her lapses in memory\nAnd Trump said on the plane yesterday that he believed that turn that rally really helped push Brett Kavanaugh over the finish line\nAnd that's something that's being echoed and talking points across the Republican spectrum tickets to the rally of this isn't your first Trump rally and we've heard so much about how important the Supreme Court is to rank and file Republicans was that a parent in the crowd with these values notably happier and more satisfied than Trump's crowds\nPre Kevin us well they definitely seemed to be in a good mood but here's something that I found really fascinating when President Trump talked about Kavanaugh they cheered when President Trump talked about how terrible the Democrats are\nThey went wild here is just an example of one of the many

S. where NPR's Jackie Northam reports Washington is pushing back\nThe U.S is unquestionably the leader in advanced technology think artificial intelligence robotics sophisticated weaponry\nIt's what's helped give the country and national security edge that something China has recognized and wants in on says James Lewis a specialist in China and technology at the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThe Chinese figured out the technologies akita wealth and power and the source of technology is still the west for China so how do they get their hands on the western technology\nThree years ago Beijing unveiled it's made in China twenty twenty five strategy which calls for the country to become a world leader in advanced technologies including artificial

group an economic research firm says there were more than Thirteen hundred rounds of funding for us start ups with at least one Chinese investor over the past eight years\nIs very common for Chinese firms to have some sort of ties to the government that might just be because they have to answer to the government of party leaders back at home and the first is there some level of control\nLike shingles says this has become a concern and national security circles because the nature of emerging technology is inherently you'll use in other words the AI algorithms used to help speed up your

trying to grow the defense industry base by in type thing these companies that traditionally wouldn't work with us and don't honestly need to work with us but\nThis ultimate funding is one way Washington is trying to counter Chinese investment\nThe Trump Administration has also been aggressive in blocking several large mergers and acquisitions of us tech companies by Chinese firms\nAnd Congress is beefing up laws on the books aimed at protecting us technology from foreign governments it will allow closer scrutiny of all sorts of Chinese inroads in the tech sector says Mario ... a

Supreme Court has a new justice and Donald Trump has a new and big win\nJust a few hours ago the U.S Senate from Brett Kavanaugh\n\nThat's the president at a rally last night in Kansas will hear more about that elsewhere in the show but let's begin this hour with Molly ball she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent hey Molly Hi uh so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrats as sort of weaponized the me too movement for political gain\nAnd on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters uh with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women an al ... sitting Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country like a week ago\nWhen a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is ripping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to be an analogy\nI thought you know I think people were already angry\nBut the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled a lot of these questions aren't how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh uh left that was already I quite\nAnd uh on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the\nPresident yet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\nI think I have no idea frankly [laughter] disclose to an election\nIt's it's hard to tell what signal and what is noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said at the statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are really struggling to regain the upper hand and

edition from NPR News I'm Garcia Navarro Brett\nKavanaugh is now an associate justice of the Supreme Court the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight is now over but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time as senator stood\nAt their desks and formally voted on cabin on vice president Mike Pence presided protester after protesters stood up and yelled raw and visceral messages stir mentioned [noise]\nCircles has been seen some of the cabinet confirmations a Senate taking on one of its most important in historic

like they were in agreement\nRoad that led us here has been bitter angry and partisan\nVote to confirm drugs got what ought to do is a vote to end this worry dark chapter in a sort of for\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged aggrieved but for very different reasons Republicans sock character assassination old unproven allegations designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation when the grams diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations some of the\nBest I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most ethical sham since I've been in politics\nDemocrats like New York's ... brand soft forge claim Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school at the combination of the year old me too movement a referendum on whether women or believe when they report harassment or assault\nWe allow women's experiences sexual trauma second to a man's promotion it will not only diminish this watershed moment a societal change we are as it will bring shame and this body\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor forwards sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no woman should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked off a lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bells but while they differ on the root cause of what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage\nRepublican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing Kavanaugh\nAs a legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation to moral obligation to do better than it\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford\nTo vindicate their sacrifice vote\nRepublicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post the whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh for energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle\nThere's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kevin ... and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu this\nHas been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up he'll suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're prince and on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can of ah avoid getting sucked into\nVery big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether the employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers gay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin out of places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new world look like\nI'm closely contested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power or not\nNPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thinking you know still very much\nThank you\n\nWas born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence how it was attributed to God or to state you know as if it were meant to be\nMade it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be\nBecause the story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race I think it was\nSomething that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race was a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate tree chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in transracial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied out you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me just say this is racism even um despite all the things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white Americans\nI really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge and if I tell them they might not understand anyway because they're white\n[noise] so you started to think about this experience and eventually when you get older you decided to go in search of your birth family as an adult ... what
