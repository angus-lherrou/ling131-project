variety of controversial topics including\nIssues raised in sports Andrew bitten sports reporter for the wall Street Journal is written about the impact rushing Trojan had on the controversy over players who kneel during the plane of the national anthem street and joins us from New York Thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nWhy was this Internet research agency interested in whether football players took her new you're not during the plane of the anthem well\nAt first glance it seems a little strange right we have them talking about these weighty weighty issues like\nHealth care like the second amendment issues that are directly related to politics but then when you think about it what their efforts were aimed at we're sowing discord this issue\nStarted in twenty sixteen to draw attention to social issues racial inequality\nThis issue has been pretty much as divisive as it gets but it's not just\nPeople that are weighing in on this it's a topic that reached the president of the United states last year president Donald Trump weighed in on the topic regularly whether that was in stump speeches whether that was on Twitter so it's not just a big social cultural issue this was an issue that\nReached the top of the food chain\nWhat did you find when you are dug into the Twitter accounts that are connected to the Internet Research Agency well what we found\nWas these tweets head be gone all the way dating back to twenty fourteen but when Colin Kaepernick began the movement then we saw these issues sparked life and then in September of twenty Seventeen\nPresident Trump gives a speech in Alabama that really attacks the players using crude language it became a big cultural moment and then the Twitter trolls spring to life even more and so that's one of the first things one of the second things you look at when you start to parse through the data\nIs which angle they were coming from so of the partisan tweets eighty seven percent were from what the researchers at Clemson University who helped provide us with this data eighty seven percent they identified as right wing conservative those are the people who would be\nA sailing the players for the kneeling calling them unpatriotic Thirteen percent were supporting Colin Kaepernick supporting the players so it's interesting to look at that break down wonder how that influenced the conversation ...\n... so it it it wasn't director to achieving a certain result just to to stir things up apparently\nYeah and the the word we hear over and over when it comes to politics and what they were trying to do on social media is so discord\nAnd this is in some ways just the perfect issue to do that because it is a fraught\nContentious issue and also you want people to pay attention to what you're doing you want something to go viral football is the most popular sport in America they chose some pretty red meat some pretty rabid fans to try to track of this debate [noise]\nAh I gather a lot of these accounts have been closed right\nYeah so the accounts from this study have been closed but you know what we see with the is it sometimes seems to be a game of whack a mole ones closed down new ones pop up and one of the interesting notes that the ... and professors had was that these are closed but they're monitoring new ones that they suspect to be connected to the same operations\nAnd they're continuing to weigh in\nOn controversial sporting topics such as a month ago we saw the new Nike campaign with Colin Kaepernick which again became a charge moment and then that's the type of things where they would continue to weigh in\nAndrew beaten in the wall Street Journal thanks so much for being with us thanks so much for having me on\nTwenty years is not a

have a particular role handling\nAll that stuff that's your job and we know that what our audience wants\nIs for us to make them feel a little better and if that takes a ignoring the bad stuff and focusing on the goofy them will do that if there is something goofy about the bad stuff will highlight that\nAll I can say is the worst of the news and sometimes it's been very bad the more we feel an obligation to step up to the plate and really bring the silly [noise]\nYou've had so many um famous gas including of course of a president of United States to two presidents of you'd have we have the rock Obama before he became president but I'm taking credit for it because he hasn't spoken to be sense\n[laughter] and the second president the second president was Bill Clinton who appear to host president say that's right and one of the things I have loved to be able to do obviously again to can compare and contrast your job and the rest of NPR News is to find out what these people think about serious issues of the day their positions that are inside\nMy job is if there is one to make them appear to be human beings and I take some pride in that if we can get somebody like more recently John Case it for example and we can show the audience that he's actually a very funny guy can tell a story\nThen sure people will go on and they'll think what they think about John Case it

pumpkin spice in the world series\nJoining us now to talk about some of these ads and their tone in this election cycle is professor Michael Franz who teaches political science at Bowdoin College and he's one of the directors of the Wesleyan Media project professor thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure I have to tell you I almost don't see an ad that political ed these days it's not negative it might just watching the wrong spaces\n[laughter] well it's possible uh about fifty percent of the ads that air in federal campaigns are purely negatives but a a number of them are also what we call contrast ads which pit the policy messages of either candidate against each other and if you combine those\nTogether you get a huge majority of ads which do contain an attack on the opposition yeah\nUh have you noticed that this campaign season is any worse or any better for that matter\nYou know it depends on how you want to analyze the data what we generally found is that the percentage of ads on TV\nThat are negative is roughly that's consistent with previous elections like the previous mid term in twenty fourteen\nBut one big difference we're seeing this cycle is that there are a lot more TV ads on TV and so as a result of there being more TV ads even though the percentage of negativity is the same people are in actuality seeing more negative ads than they've ever seen\nBut are fewer people watching television and more people are watching streaming services are are getting ...\nYes so fewer people are watching TV but one of the groups of people who tends to watch TV and very traditional ways are older Americans and they're the ones who are the most likely to vote in mid term campaigns for younger people who are moving away from live television and getting more content online\nThere's a lot of negativity there too so it's it's it's very hard to escape\nA negative a campaign environment when you're in the midst of a very competitive election season\nWhat are some of the as you've seen this year that stay with you or or for that matter singer to season aren't you\n[laughter] uh you know there there are there are lots of of of advertisements that have connected or or attached I should say seems to the opposition in ways that we haven't seen before and so there are a few campaigns that have tried to critique their opposition as essentially being\nConnected to terrorist organizations\nAnd that kind of explicit attack is not something that we generally seen in the past\nYeah we're speaking in a week obviously when package bombs have been set out to a number of people and and questions being raised about\nThe tone of political rhetoric and public discourse these days do you draw any link between the tone set by some of these ads and fear many Americans have that the political atmosphere in this country has just gotten a whole lot more mean\nYeah this is a tough one to um decipher because I think that uh our our tone and the vitriol between\nTypical advertising is a reflection of the polarization\nThe only thing I'll say it as a wrinkle to that is at least campaign advertisements on television has to make an appeal to an electorate where you want to win the majority of votes and so you might be trying to drum up support on your side of the aisle that you are also speaking to a middle the set of voters moderates independents are swing voters\nAnd you can't be too vitriolic and those messages more often than not and that does in a way moderate your message\nMichael Franz boat in college who is co director of the Wesleyan Media project thanks so much for being with us\nMy pleasure and Tamara weekend edition Sunday Lulu looks at our political rhetoric and language may affect us and how we speak to each other you can listen to that story tomorrow morning by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\n[noise]\nAnd it's time for sports [noise]\nThe art or fiction is dead by the time our group began to get up for work there the longest gaming World Series history we're still going on at Eighteen innings seven hours ... minutes that's longer than the playing time of the entire Nineteen thirty nine\nWorld Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers one three to walk home or by max Muncie in the bottom of the Eighteenth Tom Goldman joined us Tom are you there man are you there your way yeah now I'm here I'm here oh my word what a game unbelievable I I watched all of it well kind of all of that I watched um\n[noise] you know there were some times maybe from innings fourteen to Seventeen when I took a little does here and there but uh in general it was absolutely riveting and in stunning\nEighteen pictures used including by by the way Clayton corrosion arguably the best picture on the field although not last night as a pinch hitter he didn't even throw the ball a does is anybody left to throw the game tonight [laughter] well the Dodgers have\nNamed starting pitcher rich hill after the game Red Sox manager Alex ... still hadn't decided who he's starting later today in game for he had used up pretty much everyone is part of his when now philosophy and that includes\nNathan you've all these Scott six innings and relief he threw just shy of a hundred pitches\nHe was brilliant and of course max Muncie ruined it for him and the Dodgers Walker bealer we got a dealer builders if I did was eight brilliant this was two games you know literally was tonight any games\nAnd for the first game Walker Mueller was the star uh he threw seven innings he was given the ball and has to basically save\nThe Dodgers season because if the Dodgers had gone down three oh no teams ever come back in the world series from a three oh deficit Walker below goes at Heathrow seven innings holds the mighty Red Sox line up to two hits he was fantastic he turned the ball over after the seventh inning\nTo can lead chance and they're great reliever and had he not given up a home run to Boston it would have been just kind of a normal when with Walker bealer being the start\nOf the night does not LA now have anything left in the tank to win\n... that's a good question to ask either of these teams Scott because they both put absolutely everything and more into this game\nLA one and so they're they're feeling really good about that but you know going into games for but\nBoth teams are stocked with professional baseball players they'll figure out a way to you know to win for their teams and if we predict something now it will inevitably be wrong so the one thing we can say we've got a series now and uh it's fun Tom Goldman\nBob Cousy and bill Russell was one of the greatest they were\nThe Tracy and Hepburn the rocky and Apollo of the basketball court they
