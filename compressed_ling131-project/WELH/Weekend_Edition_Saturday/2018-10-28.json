critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice turning the presidential campaign but now here we're at that precipice\nAgain and it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack\nAfter the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue was the Affordable CARE Act so we've now seen three instance\nAre targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back\nEven to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacists in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\nThe phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize them have Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\nI ... I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum has been in the news is you know um you have actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions are in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how\nThe way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals\nView an entire group of people absolutely\nYeah so in in one recent study with Renee floors he's a\nSociologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about\nThe many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorbed this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized that we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chamber of whoever consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the types of ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative held and yet\nThis criminality stereotyped as it seems to have of overwhelmed people's kind of political divide 'em and has invaded invaded our mind\nArmy hotels dot com slash Providence\nI'm we're wrong with these headlines a forty six year old man is in custody facing twenty nine charges after a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday eleven people were killed and six others were wounded including for police officers the suspect reportedly had no criminal record but had posted anti Semitic posts on line\nPresident Trump has ordered flags that federal buildings throughout the country flown at half staff to show respect for the dead he also condemned what he called an evil anti Semitic act\nAnd in baseball the red Sox beat the Dodgers nine to sex and the fourth game of the world series last night Boston now leads the best of seven series three games to one game five is tonight in Los Angeles I'm neuron NPR News in Washington\nMay [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from battle European made language learning program Bible teaches practical conversation and Spanish French German and other languages available in the app store or online at B.

Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven\nPeople are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people are injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning ...\nAh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nWell what we know is that eleven people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that's six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue\nOr the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media and he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning and this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin on he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\nThis into context for us Sarah there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this off\nMass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on like in a loving people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades yeah\nAnd we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like every one is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue of to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner\nAnd and this is you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do it I don't know what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYeah but I didn't mention there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happen so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families a Jewish and otherwise uh throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and\nAnd several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out death sentences but unless the president is is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRight and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do and so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise]\nWell I I think it needs to chew Asians\nAnd and I I've not been on the ground here in Pittsburgh too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so um people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is there's a search for why after the the love right is shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for a crime so they can prosecute investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but uh it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nWe're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning It's MORNING\nSo set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference and now I'm we're going to go there live here we go\nFrom most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the victims of yesterday's senseless acts of hatred and violence to the families and friends to groups were Jewish community and to the larger community of preferred\nJewish community of Brits bird is one that we as priests burgers treasure it's an important part of the cultural and social identity of Pittsburgh and so this was an attack upon our neighbors and upon our friends and one that we felt very deeply\nThe fact that this attack took place during the worship service makes it even more heinous\nExtend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families I met with them last night during the process of identification and there's no words to express a\nUh the the um the sympathy that they need it yesterday evening that the uh\nI'm a synagogue we've uh uh uh the synagogue and ... all eleven victims ah before they were removed and brought from the synagogue last night to my office uh\nUh we've

saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she just say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story would turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will it seemed to be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger or in a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nThe financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that town\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWhat sites like let's say last Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you so much\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this\nBlack voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about\nEducated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about like people [noise] well I\nThink one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because by ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue\nAnd in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say white but are voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world or something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nAbsolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nThe very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we got legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago but why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as ...\nWhen it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how\nDid those two things than fit when you're trying to discuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] when I was clearly argue we're all biased\nI think the way that we covered the election showed that ... to be very glaring clear\nBecause we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying right ... voted on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt\nAnd we're like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased\nBut also when we talk about fairness is it fair\nThis morning at eleven on the public radio eighty nine point three at them\n\n\n\nFrom NPR News in Washington DC

frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock\nAre we getting it getting it as an understanding all we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to us all\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric think also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nSchachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the election\nNow we came back from that precipice during the presidential campaign\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo piece position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords it was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the
