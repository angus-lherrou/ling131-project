I was very clear about that and so it really depends on now countries with with with liquid ... [noise]\nUh and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise] uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to impose sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found the deaths were very sleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't done this has published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and if it at least they didn't know anything about whether it was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends species official Stuart eat what I have been all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all these official there shouldn't be so high is not to its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked these students and why they were attacked\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not these about why the west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I had reports all the shirt reports that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean see I was before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that two bosses where they were transferred dating insight to the CD\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City so they went to was a station\nThey do do that you both ... and ... when the students were trying to escape ... be spy bosses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staples east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm\n... ... from these two buses disappeared all the forty three students so\nThe federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult parts of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside buff is that it did was just too\nI'm not so nice to versus what exactly did two votes is that the army and they said that police start to money to operate\nScene Steve ... before I mean these two bosses would that do both is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so what I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the bus the secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students ... no vote the army and if that belief they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what this was really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to conduct with one person that works for him and the west these ah informant and inside the cartels that explain made this ...

as polarized as ever [noise] public radio has been exploring that polarization and the media's role in it to the new podcast we're calling pressed\nOur producer Mary Clinton met two neighbors and south kings county Rhode Island who hail from across the political divide\nAnd they've agreed to take part you know little experiment\nI'm horrified I'm completely horrified and I consider myself a serious member of the resistance to what's been going on I'm just appalled\nSo this is Bonnie as a serious member of the resistance to what's been going on she belongs to a local immigrant rights group and she participated in the women's march on Washington After President Trump's inauguration hash it out of the president\nPresident of my country but his and no way the president of my mind and my heart my politics not anybody I can identify with or be proud of in any way\nEven though Bonnie feels so strongly about social issues and about the president not my president she has friends from across the political spectrum\nOther friends of mine said well how can you be friends with somebody who's a big deal Trump supporter and I think well you know how can you not I mean the world is full of all different kinds of people and I don't only want to hang around with people who are just like may have boring would that be\nSo funny like having friends with different political perspective but the thing is Bonnie doesn't actually engage with those perspective we just don't talk politics and not being able to talk politics is new for Bonnie\nHave certainly known people have different social and political persuasion all my life and have been able to disagree with people and have conversations and things seem so polarized and so hateful\nNow that largely avoid talking politics with friends whose orientations I don't know or no to be quite different to mind because it seems to get so angry so quickly\nAnd I'm distressed by that I Would like to be able to understand and be able to say well where can we find some common ground\nSo something that reflects the political\nDivide in our country and maybe also exacerbates it is the news media we consume\nMany of us seek out sources and opinions that reflect what we already believe and avoid the things we disagree with\nBonnie for example sticks to centered and left leaning media while avoiding right leaning sources so if like Bonnie we want to understand where other people are coming from may be consuming media that presents a variety of viewpoints would help so that's what Bonnie is going to do for one week she'll go on a balanced news media diet\nShe'll consume equal parts left right and center sources\nAnd we'll see if this experiment gives Bonnie a better understanding of other perspectives like the perspective of her friend Dave [noise]\n... has lived across the street from each other for Eighteen years I did vote for it or or that\nHe is a very kind hearted generous man he delights in doing favors for anybody and everybody you know he comes over here and help us do stuff and my husband goes over there and help them do stuff and there's a great guy we just don't believe the same things politically this is Mary you're going to have fun\nHaving a nice time for the\nSafest one of the friends Bonnie is hoping to bridge the divide with after bunny brought me over to David and introduced us I talked with him one on one turns out he's also interested in bridging the divide with Bonnie\nWhy can't the two of us are going to talk about what's going on in the world and and not ever be a personal for because that's part of the pro communication is gone throughout the country\nSo states going to do the experiment two for one week he'll ad centered and left leaning sources to his mostly conservative media diet\nAnd at the end of the week David Bonnie are going to sit down and do what they've been avoiding talk politics because they've never really talk politics before they don't have a full sense of where the other person stands on a lot of the issues they don't know yet how strongly they might disagree once they do sit down and talk\nSo let's get a sense of how wide the divide might be before David Bonnie undertake this experiment let's hear dates takes on some of the issues we already know body feels\nStrongly about we already know how she feels about Trump\nI Do not like Mr Trump in any way at all and I'm horrified by in fact\nAnd Dave doesn't understand why someone would feel this way\nThat I guess maybe I Need to understand a little bit about why people free over where they do\nDonald Trump I don't understand why people aren't accepting the fact that things are getting better\nAnd we know that Bonnie as passionate about women's rights But Dave doesn't really see what all the fuss is about\nA see a lot of women are in top spots I look at the sports teams there's women's teams there's men's teams there's a lot of women movies I mean it seems to me that there's an effort all across to be you know equal\nAnd just to remind you Bonnie as part of a taskforce dedicated to protecting immigrant rights here Steve on immigration\nSo all this illegal aliens stuff to me is you know what's the primary word they're illegal my father came here sponsored by somebody at sixteen years old worked on a farm\nTo go to school to get the ... century so it could become an ... ... people and they run rampant do\nWhatever they want and they don't have to follow any rules and my father knew that he had to become\nAn American or else ...\nEmotions are running high right now when it comes to the social and political issues we're facing as a country\nAnd considering how strongly Dave and Bonnie feel about things I personally think it's remarkable that they want to do this experiment\nWhat are you hoping to learn from a death or get out of all of this\nI don't know that I'm going to get anything wives shattering out of it other than to see what it is that I'm missing\nAnd maybe decide whether I'm really missing anything or not because of what I watch what I listen to typically am I getting what I think there should be getting or is there something really valuable that are missing by not going somewhere else\nSo Bonnie days have decided to finally sit down and talk about politics but first with the goal of getting a better understanding of other perspectives they spent a week reading watching and listening to new media from across the political spectrum\nAnd I asked them to document their experiences by recording daily voice than us with their phones\nI just got through spending about forty five minutes watching MSNBC and Fox and MSNBC spent the entire forty five minutes talking about the comment that Rudy Giuliani may have a president could have shot call me and not been indicted\nWe did this experiment in the first week of June twenty Eighteen\nThat week President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told the Huffington Post that the president couldn't be indicted for any crimes while in office as an example of a crime that the president's supposedly couldn't be indicted for Giuliani offered the hypothetical scenario of shooting instead of nearly firing\nFormer FBI Director and head of the Russia investigation James Comey so on MSNBC\nThey went on and on about the president's not above the law you can\nDo this because in America no one is above the law that's Joe Scarborough on MORNING Joe the show Davis watching\nBut the actual statement said that he would be impeached immediately and then they could do whatever they want it to them so it's pretty clear that they have taken half of the statements\n\n\nOr an\nNPR News in Washington DC this weekend edition\n\nOf the guys had to borrow that morning

I Love dogs with that kind of dressed up in your outfits we heard it on the radio and I I'm not the dog didn't look at that happy about that lots of lots of talk I and as a real of a lot of young people on this small study they're specially people that couldn't vote in the last referendum if they were too young\nAnd they were the ones saying that's what I being they think that ... with a mask basically which is severely affecting ... so a lot of them are really pushing for these people buy on any kind of ... the government and agreed\nWell ... is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um is a vote possible\nSo legally if possible we could have\nThey stuck and by the prime minister ... and I have said\nThat's not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to find a second to get all the legislation in place and as you've got to be getting what ever sneak you to leave in March they probably if that was going to be some kind of people that I Would have to then\nThat the day and not would have to be put back so the British Government would have to agree to that and all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries\nWould have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big African this amount of time reading\nThat's the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state well\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump ... turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because we average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or us how she\nMight have so they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats of any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states that were really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan there and they are they're Rio and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nI think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states you mentioned Michigan\nFor the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just haven't spent the money to fix the roads so that's a good\nConnecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they are talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the Democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that isn't as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yeah the taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave changed a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty cents is that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the line now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre President Nixon had ended the Justice Department having let go of his attorney general deputy attorney general and the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal\nPresident Trump is vocally frustrated with Robert Mueller's investigation so could it happen again here's Ron Elving NPR senior editor and correspondent with the story of the Saturday Night massacre it's why we call him professor on\nThe Democratic National Committee was trying to solve a mystery\nMost Americans alive today hadn't even been born in Nineteen Seventy two

Julie Garcia Navarro head of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz laughter Hispanic nickname his rival ... as long used\nFor\n\nSelf hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWhat's your name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an NGO size version of it he wasn't the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nThe tried Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can overuse identity and we can bring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why do people have different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the kind of the best for you and other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role than of identity and politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co opting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should on to your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way\nAnd that leads down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know will for the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal\nDream cruise from you've ever go to the government means that every time\nSomebody or one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that intellect from re vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order for grown in the country\nHow concerned are you I mean I'm I'm hearing a a a real note of concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and in a certain way\nYou know I think I could get those were and I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things are immigration ... there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground but it's not available to us\nBecause the people who are most in ... I think that every confession is not coming together but losing losing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHere the other question is whether you could do that with our what Hugo rattling weaponize in order to\nAnd I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs a capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity is who makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lives that bind me thinking identity thank you very much for your room of\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use\nIn the complete cookbook for young shots NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef and she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nEight year old Lucy Gray is wide and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief\nOf the nation me she so good to meet you were a little excited\nLucy likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family that this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a ... and she takes a peso Lucy decides to taste it\nGoes what are the the nasal\n[laughter] at one point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nAll this is one table too that's at that says she SP which is the abbreviation for peace and this is one capital T ... and let me ask you something live at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yes you call it\n... there's so many words in these recipes that you just don't know until you hooked on it so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and shop this recipe calls for a chopped onion first and has to be peel [noise] his son\nThe coup against the size of safety in the kitchen which Birnbaum demonstrates went shopping the onion it can be hard to make\nThis first Koch so yeah you see how my fingers are like this all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally or the other night so this is the safe way to hold a knife and how to anything to\nPrep were finished it's time to cook beginning with those chopped onions\nSoon as we want to start the onions pretty frequently you don't have to do it\nAll fell things [noise]\nAfter reading garlic Lucy pours into tomatoes only ...

do the Garcia Navarro good morning\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by a policeman he detonated his explosive vests outside\nOr in the north there was shelling and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul I brought his armed men and he's a candidate and he tried to prevent other people from getting to the polling\nElections the Afghan governance announced its arrested or a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers\nAt the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nBriefly what is it signified of the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country in conflict to conflict at the United states is involved and\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether this vote should be held at all\nBut Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision\nMore than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress and the battles insurgents around the country the Taliban are resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came out to exercise their civil right\nWhen you bring a nine point three SM\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the

Washington Post columnist was killed in\nThe Saudi consulate in Istanbul ... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region and being with us\nMy pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king Solomon\nCourse uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of a lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists to sit in\n'em and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now a there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they released information really to extract as much I think leverage is possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart uh they uh looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending a you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis\nThey have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange than you'd investment that need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government\nTo ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact senator he looked like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was ... a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty fourteen students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration\nBut those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very nicely blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I hadn't done this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that and I had her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that they are to me and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything and these officials started what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official bearish on each side is not true it's a lie\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not these about why the west got any that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just these\nEven more I have reports all the shirt reports that proves that the army and police way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean so yeah it was before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that to Boston where they were transport dating insight to the CD\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the was take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to was a station\nThey do do that you both us and when the students were trying to escape on board will be ... by buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staples east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all ... of that back way to bust his\n... from these two buses disappeared all their forty three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students on this bus has disappeared why were they targeting this group students why with the federal police and the army get involved in\nThis these wise I think the most difficult part of my ...\nIf the students were traveling inside boss is that good watch just to\n[noise] I Know so these two versus what exactly did two bosses that the army and they said that belief is that to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do both is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so what I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to me as a harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students have even now it for the army and if it that I Believe they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these guys that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow do you know that heroin was hitting on that bus\nI was able to connect with one drug lord in both on drugs last I was able to conduct with one person that works for him and west these ah informant and inside the cartels that explained made this ... [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean there's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen\nAccording would my investigation that there's a responsible these crime wise that twenty seven battalion any water\nIn particular the court and then died received a phone call from the rubble are\nAll very him you have to rescue my drugs I pay you for these you have to I don't know I Know why do you have to do I want my jokes back\nHave they faced any consequences what if they said to to your findings

serious member of the resistance to what's been going on I'm just appalled\nSo this is Bonnie as a serious member of the resistance to what's been going on she belongs to a local immigrant rights group and she participated in the women's march on Washington After President Trump's inauguration how you feel that the president\nNot my president [laughter] he's the president of my country but his and now when the president of my mom to my heart my politics not anybody I can identify with our be proud of in any way\nEven though Bonnie feels so strongly about social issues and about the president not my president she has friends from across the political spectrum\nOther friends of mine said well how can you be friends with somebody who's a big deal Trump supporter and I think well you know how can you not I mean the world is full of all different kinds of people and I don't I only want to hang around with people who are just like may have boring with that\nPolitical perspective but the thing is Bonnie doesn't actually engage with those perspective we just don't talk politics and not being able to talk politics is new for Bonnie\nHave certainly known people of different social and political persuasion all my life and have been able to disagree with people and have conversations and things seem so polarized and so hateful\nNow that largely avoid talking politics with friends whose orientations I don't know or no to be quite different to mind because it seems to get so angry so quickly\nAnd I'm distressed by that I Would like to be able to understand and be able to say well where can we find some common ground\nSo something that reflects the political divide in our country and maybe also exacerbates it is the news media we consume many of us seek out sources and opinions that reflects what we already believe and avoid the things we disagree with\nBonnie for example sticks to centered in left leaning media while avoiding right leaning sources so if like Bonnie we want to understand where other people are coming from may be consuming media that presents a variety of viewpoints would help so that's what Bonnie is going to do for one week she'll go on a balanced news media diet\nShe'll consume equal parts left right and center sources\nAnd we'll see if this experiment gives Bonnie a better understanding of other perspective like the perspective of her friend Dave\nDavid Bonnie has lived across the street from each other for Eighteen years I have a quota or that\nHe is a very kind hearted generous man he delights in doing favors for anybody and everybody you know he comes over here and help us do stuff and my husband goes over there and help them do stuff and there's a great guy we just don't believe the same things politically this is Mary you're going to have fun\nI have a nice time for the state\nIs one of the friends than he is hoping to bridge the divide with after Bonnie brought me over to days and introduced us I talked with him one on one turns out he's also interested in bridging the divide with Bonnie\nWhy can't the two of us are taught to talk about what's going on in the world and a nod have would be a personal for because that's part of the pro communication is gone throughout the country\nSo they it's going to do the experiment two for one week he'll ad centered and left leaning sources to his mostly conservative media diet and at the end of the week David Bonnie are going to sit down and do what they've been avoiding talk politics\nBecause they've never really talk politics before they don't have a full sense of where the other person stands on a lot of the issues they don't know yet how strongly they might disagree once they do sit down and talk\nSo let's get a sense of how wide the divide might be before David Bonnie undertake this experiment let's hear dates takes on some of the issues we already know Bonnie feel strongly about we already know how she feels about Trump\nI Do not like Mr Trump in any way at all and I'm horrified by in fact\nAnd Dave doesn't understand why someone would feel this way\nThat are just maybe I Need to understand a little bit about what people free over where they do because the core hysteria over bottle Trump or don't understand why people are accepting the fact that things are getting better\nAnd we know that Bonnie as passionate about women's rights But Dave doesn't really see what all the fuss is about\nIs she a lot of women a top spots a look at sports teams there's women's teams are loans teams there's a lot of women movies I mean it seems to me that there's an effort all across to be you know equal\nTo remind you Bonnie as part of a taskforce\nSteve on immigration so all this illegal aliens stuff to me is you know what's the primary word they're illegal\nMy father came here sponsored by somebody at sixteen years old worked on a farm\n\nTo go to school to get citizenship soldiers to recover her well we'll just let people in Iran ramp and do\nWhatever they want and they don't have to follow any rules and my father knew that he had to become an\nAmerican ...\nEmotions are running high right now when it comes to the social and political issues we're facing as a country\nAnd considering how strongly Dave and Bonnie feel about things I personally think it's remarkable that they want to do this experiment\nWhat are you hoping to learn from all of this or get out of all of this\nI don't know that I'm going to get anything wives shattering out of it other than to see what it is that I'm missing and maybe decide whether I really missing anything or not\nBecause of what I watch what I listen to typically am I getting what I think there should be getting or is there something really valuable that are missing by not going somewhere else\nSo Donny and Dave have decided to finally sit down and talk about politics but first with the goal of getting a better understanding of other perspectives they spent a week reading watching and listening to news media from across the political spectrum\nAnd I asked them to document their experiences by recording daily voice memos with their phones\nOr just go through spending about forty five minutes watching MSNBC and Fox and MSNBC spent the entire forty five minutes talking about the comment that Rudy Giuliani may have a president could have shot combing and not been indicted\nWe did this experiment in the first week of June twenty Eighteen\nThat week President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani told the Huffington Post that the president couldn't be indicted for any crimes while in office as an example of a crime that the president supposedly couldn't be indicted for Giuliani offered the hypothetical scenario of shooting instead of nearly firing\nFormer FBI Director and head of the Russia investigation James Comey so on MSNBC\nThey went on and on about the president's not above the law you\nCan do this because in America no one is above the law that's Joe Scarborough on MORNING Joe the show Dave was watching\nBut the actual statements good as you would be impeached immediately and then they could do whatever they want it to them so it's pretty clear that they have taken half of the statements", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Providence", "day": "21"}
