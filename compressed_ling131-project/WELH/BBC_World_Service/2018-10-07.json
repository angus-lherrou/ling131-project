motivate them on the basis of satisfaction which is a strange thing for American politics where historically the sunnier happier politician tends to when\nI'm what but but what we see here is Democrats are obviously fearful of President Trump they don't like him that's the reason they they turn out they have they have made it very clear that they are concerned now about the Supreme

science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\n[noise] one of them that will that please be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\nWell\nI live\n\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we were heading for something of a comma\nLet me issue and the Copa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually warm\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but it woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale for wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most precipitation overland after impact of the storm was\nFifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested that the description is different from the kind of description outside from friday also which used as a greater likelihood of this kind of event you these very specifically give\nEvent is being changed yes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the normal asleep won't Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform over all the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modify forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as out of their temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that are associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform or changing the F F T we actually have the pattern change of the SST that comes from the fact that\nThe kind of system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in this set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation ... look on does a bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming that region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months sea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some of those and recovery\nDrew group the national snow and ice data center was recently in the opposite between Alaska in Siberia seeing snow the continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice camp and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these buoys and ice that may be a meter sick and you're hoping that it was still survive\nAnd locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through about twenty centimeters of melt since we had deployed them which gets worrying because if the ice gets too thin and booze melt out then we lose our data\nJudy in St Louis poses a research is directly related to the climate slash whether issues of this program\nThe reason why we're so interested in the Arctic is that the Arctic is sort of a refrigerator of our planet right so it helps to keep our planet cooler than it otherwise would be and it does is by the fact that it's covered mostly by snow and ice year round", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Providence", "day": "07"}
