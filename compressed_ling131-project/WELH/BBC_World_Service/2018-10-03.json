break the little uh we're talking about the emergency broadcast system every so often all American radio and TV channels sound a squawking great ching alarmed test the system which\nIn theory would be used with us everyone to a threat uh obviously we don't want to cause any alone by playing the alarm so we're just going to talk about the alum there's a new addition to it to keep up with the times a text message or let a fourteen twenty later today everyone and we mean literally everyone is going to receive\nPresidential ... it's a text from the president and it's the first test of the ... of\nThe emergency alert system you cannot opt out the move however since voted by everyone uh there's some interesting issues behind this and history as well\nWe got it from Andrew ... who is with Harvard Kennedy School bell ...\nThe alert system has been around for about fifty five years as a way for the president to quickly send a short message to the nation and the case of pretty much only southern nuclear attack where there was not a lot of time to furnish it message\nUm that message was always going to be carried on radio and television and most Americans will probably recognize the shrill attention tone that it broadcast from the regular tests that have been going on right foot tomorrow's different because tomorrow will be the first time\nA system that was built over the last few years to allow it broadcast or directly to cell phones is being used for\nIts interesting though because cell phone's been around for ... says if the government is catching up a little bit late\nRight this was actually a implemented other couple of years ago during the Obama administration as a way to say the civil defense status that is\nThe emergency alert system needs to be modernized and now that we have this new phenomenon which is to say everyone in America more or less has a cell phone on their person um wouldn't it be nice to be able to reach them immediately\nOld television and radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from wherever the prison walls or do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirement\nUm the Federal Communications commission or in the U.S that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or a private broadcaster for that matter Mm So if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region\nYou would be um made to carry a message or the ... where it would go off and they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this channel\nThey would they would do tests so Americans with ... with\nSome of the of the emergency broadcast system\nYes there was a required a monthly test and some places they really tests as well but often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when the news and on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is a truck so there'd be Americans none of the people outside of America wouldn't know that is that's a great detail I Love that [noise] so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um that wouldn't be confusing would ditch\nThe no I I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think that having that happen right the first one is that is illegal they did set this up to say there is a way\nTo you this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically\nWouldn't be illegal now a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down to legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal as the country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House and and Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least I don't think that it would be like his Twitter account were hit on constrained access to any\nTime right so it is slightly filtered by the emergency management um uh people presumably Yukon reply so this text\nRight and [laughter] I I Want to think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and send some message either in farce or in you know ... to the entire country\nIn the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through a at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble with ... ... ... of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School I just to spoil your anticipation that message are we going to get says this this is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed\nComing from the you know are we going to get all caps luck for example well this is this is the thing I'm I'm ... in fact well what a hundred other people are interested in Aden is the kind of the fact that many people who have a ... to the current occupy of the White House will just come and go I don't want to Mr the president's going to ignore it\nEven when it could be quite important and likewise if somebody else we're in the White House\nThe other half of America would possibly avoid it as well\nAs he was

nothing wrong with that of course I'm as you're about to hear\nA but it's sort of contradicts the image that he's always presented it being a self made man who only started with a million dollars was his words not mine a President Trump's lawyers as a responded to the times story saying the allegations of fraud and tax evasion one hundred percent holes\nAnd highly disarm a tree so if the president has broken with the practice of past presidents and has refused to release his tax returns there's programs because who just spoke to one of the journalists who have the story David Boston\nAs it reveals too important once one is it reveals that the central narrative\nThat Donald Trump has told throughout his life and especially in his political campaign for the presidency narrative is self made billionaire who basically started with a million dollar loan from his\nFather turned it into this incredible the global empire but that narrative that is actually completely at odds with record itself that we when the earth my record of many tens of thousands of pages of documents from inside the real estate empire drug Trump the father of the president\nAnd that record shows in fact\nThat Donald Trump throughout his life is deeply dependent upon his father's financial support starting from the age of three and that that support continued not just through adolescence and\nAdulthood that actually you know into his forties or fifties he was being paid anywhere from five six seven million dollars a year from his father's financial empire\nOne question would be what's wrong with that I did my kids money once in awhile\nYeah no there's there's absolutely nothing wrong with parents supporting their kids the part where there is something wrong or the amount of money that Donald Trump received from his father was should be increased by a series of tax is very dubious ...\nAre we talking about ...\nAbout tax evasion right tax avoidance tax evasion is illegal and what we discovered

the mayor's office gives you access to a large amount of money\nBut they've got all these savers going on and actually outright the buying as well the going rate was around a hundred hey ice or or

green image\nIn the future and for the world to leaked for instance the Paris Agreement coding must be phased out through extensive use of new renewables and natural gas\nOr you must at some point to meet its demand beach actually at the sooner the better because I left the facade of fears needs to remain in round\nBut still that will be a need for new supplies since the ... in the coming tickets when still made by the important thing for us is that the oil that will be a part of the energy mix and the future is actually the spoiled with the lowest emissions from the production\n... by this idea that noise production is is clean but is it any cleaner than the other major well put Jesus didn't say Saudi Arabia massacres similar seals\nI think you can go around the globe and look for

would be produced with practically no emissions from the production sensitive is being powered from shore\nAs a big company are you worried that institutional investors will begin to turn away from

on and that's where we are also explaining are investors that we are preparing for a future but actually we expect\nThat the missions sincere to needs to have a higher costs and when we are now planning or projects we are adding on more costs stress testing to the fields for higher costs\nSo that we can make sure that for projects that can accept the higher and see what your costs because reading is too cheap through and and ... to me because\nI Know this last investment going on in these offshore wind farms and so on is it possible to quantify how much we know is investing in New oil drilling best is the investment and renewables\nIs off today and I think that for renewable investments represent a small part of the investments in the ... we have a strong ambitions to invest more

environment minister well can seize huh [laughter]\nOh now that's the noise at pioneer when it comes to adopting green energy and yet at the same time you're a country that still making an awful lot of money exposing fulfills does not punish your environmental credentials no\nThink that we are very aware of this or is it kind of power though so we need a strategy that has two sides to it one is that we want to lead into use so\nWe had last month was four to seven percent or electric car sales\nWere doing a locked on green shipping on these things are more than six they elected Ferris coming into your use you can see that and and also in other areas and at the same time they're very aware of that for the world to reach the Paris Agreement goals not only are the two degree\nThat warming but also aiming for one put five degrees you have to stop the use of fossil fuels is false Leslie called\n... but it ain't no way you've got legally binding emissions reduction targets drenched asking twenty fifty but the most recent thing is I could find show that you see here to admissions which is of course a key greenhouse gas still giving up slightly\nOver the last couple of years to have gone down slightly last month when seven percent uh last year\nSo this is Ross is to work even harder on reducing our emissions are especially from transportation where we are doing a lot\nBut he's also takes time until it really it really gives an effect but at the same time for us it's important that we know that the oil and gas industry will become a smaller part of our economy and the future so we need also the\nBetter shape than for the movement it is that you're going to keep on drilling and people expect the total production is oil and gas to keep rising until twenty twenty three\nAnd that is also live in now have set down a climate to risk from commission also to look at what the risk for our whole economy read the expectations that we can see also on what has to be done three to reach the parent it perfectly among the they also live with their report\nThis December but also be part of the discussion of course here\nSo you got the idea that the richest countries have to lead the way it's not enough just to to reduce your reading comments that printed in the days about new ways political impact\nOh definitely but if it's the producers older users that are the most to blame I'm not sure if that is a a good discussion I mean we all have to change and we have to change much false than they've ever talked before it's to reach the Paris Agreement so we have to be into for
