G.\nWell maybe that I Am the hottest year on record is twenty sixteen an El Nino year when the conditions in the Pacific ocean put a huge amounts of extra heat into the atmosphere there was all points of remarkable weather event\nYear started I was a ... La Nina setting about imagined that twenty eight team was going to be combat every year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThat impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods\nWildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there are some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change in how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs across puffing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades\nThe first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event but which now ranks early night among annual averages ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages early parts of the climate story and not the pop the masses to us\nScientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yes we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise from melting ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines\nThat is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I voted wants to be cautious weather of some kind of rule does happen every yeah\nAll right let me think what is not necessarily a harbinger of what we can say the reason why won't do any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that is still quite rare and it's now a relatively common and that\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here words of heat heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take\nExtreme drought you combine it with extreme heat you're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is the fact that climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple attitude and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high stress ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks\nThey also put another high over Siberia with high heat that an over North America where the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia it's getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm the summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season in California Winter isn't now California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen\nThe Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California only\nThis summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is an indication of the the profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nTo us [noise] but I Know storage among the largest fire forty amounts bigger than the size of Los Angeles [noise]\n\nThese are the conditions lived experience ...

think a ratified to justify that food Dale\nUm but they wanted to see these today's ... says the three of original signatories would remain in place Robyn just become an adult somebody go say that so they seem satisfied in that regard\nAnd and what about this handover of power or both of these leaders the outgoing and the incoming one is happy about it as each other\nWell Mr Lopez Obrador himself hasn't spoken but to his negotiator has we'll see how they ask you said we celebrate the trial offer agreements on the line and the fact that his try not to he said it closes the door to trade fragmentation of the region\nNest to as he could it which I thought it was quite interesting we'll give stupidity or uncertainties and mixed has come with its North American partners and outgoing president Enrique Pena Nieto\nHas said he'd spoken by prime minister Trudeau and President Trump this morning and cools the agreement a win win win so you know at this stage both down at both sides so at least sounding pleased with the results\nThanks very much well let's turn to the Canadian side of things uh this is what President Trump had to say about American farmers\nThe deal includes a substantial increase in our farmers opportunities to explored American we poultry eggs and dairy including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nI Want to reverse 'cause\nI come from like two scoops of dairy ice cream we understand but will the Canadians like this part of the deal Jessica [noise]\nWell look if this is considered a win for you as far as it is very much less though or Canadian dairy they're definitely a couple of concessions made by the Canadian team not including increasing the slice of the dairy market available to us producers from about one percent two three point six\nPercent and the dairy farmers are not at all happy\nThat they're saying that it really this is putting their their future of the future of their families at risk taking care of that this is not the first time that Canada has increased access at ... dairy market as part of the trachea notably\nThis could spell trouble for Trudeau in uh the upcoming election which is coming up in twenty Nineteen especially in the province of Quebec where there are a lot of dairy farmers\nAll that said what to do is saying today is look at first off the U.S we're really seeking a complete dismantling of Canada supply management system around dairy\nThat was the original us demand it is very much pare down there just getting more access he's also a promising a phone conversation for dairy farmers in Canada so that should take some of the sting out of this concessions\nAnd what about the personal relationship that's being some a pretty ... times between the leaders of Canada and the United states in recent months but uh they're all sounding\nQuite warm today what what's your assessment\nTaffy I think is the word a U.S read that Donald Trump used today describing\nSome of the the the um the the relationship between him and Trudeau in recent months and I think that's fair I think it was the most heated around you and around the G ... meeting and get back\nWhere true came out saying that candidate would not be pushed around by the U.S on trade a Trump came out calling unique mild week I and and that really just showed that there was a lot of tension between the two when it came to trade\nNow at least for today it looks like it's water under the bridge this may sound like a bit of a Potter too but\nThe Canada and us relationship has weathered a lot of storms I'm between the leaders leaders have not always gotten along and I think that that type you go deeper than than sometimes politics and sometimes these disagreements that happened between between leaders\nJessica ... thanks very much a guaranteed down here in Washington just a quick thought you mentioned that this is a kind of deal that will appeal to some of those votes as in the post industrial Midwestern states which will be so important to President Trump and his presidential victory do you think this will have an impact on the midterm elections that are coming up\nI think it's possible and I think it's possible that will motivate some of the base of the voted for him to come out and say sign cute or in some in that sense all their votes has\nNever really thank you for things you've done or new for things you promising to do the farmers may may do the same but so the president has not to sacrifice something he's given up for example he's insistence on on scrap and who the shots and Nineteen policy of NAFTA which is the arbitration mechanism Canadians of\nOf their own why on that and of course the other big thing was still in place is the steel and out of medium towers twenty five and ten percent both from\nCanada and Mexico those are still in place are on the president decided not to be negotiated as part of this process\nGary thanks very much Gary are don't here in Washington and also thank you to Jessica Murphy in Toronto and two will grant in Mexico city let's think NASA Terry she and he's a Canadian position with a ruling liberal policy member of the parliamentary committee on international trade joining us from ... I'm a U.S happy as everyone else seems to be\nWell this is absolutely a fantastic it's such a positive step forward from where we were um you know with the ah the American administration is you know extremely protection um you know we have to deal\nWith the ... the framework of a deal incredible and uh you know ... to to work this deal and to make things better for for all three parties and in this particular agreements not\nEveryone is happy though one one a Canadian companies direct to the United steelworkers said there was sold out some steel and aluminum workers by not getting rid of the twenty five percent still terrorists in the ten percent a highly medium terrorists has to be some compromise that or not if not all of your voters will let type will be happy about\n[noise] well I'm not particularly\nDue to the national security measure that is a ... will separate from the then the negotiations to put\nTariffs on steel and aluminum\nAround the world including Canada and uh our government is committed to a you know supporting the industry ... billion dollars into play to support workers and the industry and strengthen the steel industry to limit the streets of long term that's one piece\nAnd put in place dollar for dollar a counter terrorists and uh\nSo with today's deal\nIt's very positive because it's moving forward a in a in a positive manner and I've spoken with prime minister and I've spoken with the ministry of\nTrade on August ... and they are committed to a you know in this positive the momentum to continue\nTo negotiating and getting rid of those tariffs because that will be a win win for both of us 'cause uh businesses are affected on ... both sides of the border\nYou started your comments by saying the U.S administration is is fundamentally protectionist that's no change that has it and and despite this deal you are still going to have a fight on your hands to keep\nThe kind of a trade that you want with it you\nGotta keep boat you know redouble our efforts and I think that's why this this is\nA deal is an extremely positive uh you know step forward or you know we gotta keep on this momentum and just keep keep working at a obviously we have the number of months or had us where we roll up our sleeves and you know we need to work\nOr to gather because we put dollar for dollar normal steel aluminum but we've also put tariffs on a number of other a skill products and um you know it will be a and everyone's best interest for us to to get rid of those tariffs that you were thirty two\nWhich which is a ... century\n[noise] it ... it is it's not good economics\nIt's it's not a good for anyone so I think that you know cutting off the ministry and putting the to search chew on autos which would have been devastating for the economy symbol side was critical in this agreement and all sorts or the steel industry because that's one of the number one and places where the steel ends I\nBriefly um and President Trump said he was in love with Kim Jong un ah yesterday do you think he's back in love with Justin Trudeau\nWhile I can tell you what the minister Justin Trudeau has been absolutely amazing uh Egypt to a a\nA line and then when he ... dispute resolution or on the table chapter and hygiene is absolutely critical it gives us a all of a way to deal with a A N e just the way forward\nTerry ... thank you very much\nDistribution of BBC News hour in the U.S has supported by Deloitte private helping privately held companies address risk and\nFind opportunity in today's complex business environment you can learn more to loitering dot com slash us slashed private\nAnd buy Rice University working to achieve transformative discoveries and to develop leaders who disrupt traditional paradigms Rice University on conventional wisdom more at rice dot edu slash future\nRhode Island public radio good chance showers low seventies more showers likely tonight mid fifties possible showers tomorrow fog and upper sixties\nSupport for Rhode Island public radio includes Rhode Island ... commerce corporation helping businesses succeed with the Rhode Island small business hotline more and four zero one five to one help or go to our eyes small biz dot com", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "01"}
