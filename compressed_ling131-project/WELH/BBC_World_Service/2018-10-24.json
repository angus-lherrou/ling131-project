that's all\nI have to admit not really because I'm ... friend that so many people so many people especially of course the Jewish people in his community I think he should feel sorry for them\nWhy have you done it well it's difficult to explain we off to him and he told us or that you wanted to be a Jew love to be a Jew and so we invented the story to make the people believe that he's a Jew\nI can imagine an awful lot of people in my community across the wide a Jewish community in Germany being pretty outraged about a story\nThat's the case and um I think many people are pretty ...\nThe only man it's like that there are many people are pretending to be Jews and they know so it's another example and I'm a big number of examples I have to say it's it's it's a problem in Germany\nIs a

you know currently incarcerated uh because of the exact system they don't match\n'em all the data information so I'm One person was ineligible ah we'll get flagged in a system and other people with

to vote\nOn paper for 'em and but and then say other than\nThat we also understand that they've been said incidents with say a busload of black scene is one table to to continue when they were about

the bus a because there were complaints\nThat I'm the boss was organized or the voting trick was organized by one of the political parties um and there's no law in Georgia that prevent seniors or people period\nFrom I'm participating and I'm a voter or a bus driver to go vote but um one person in front of took it upon themselves\nTo order the seniors off of the vote and and unfortunately I'm a

I mentioned in Georgia\nYou keep you from someone in on the BBC motives for two weeks to go into the midterms in the u._s. but next what went wrong we'd South Sudan on the new come she was born in twin to live with those votes amusement goodwill but just about\nTwo years later the country collapsing and vicious civil war broke out ... from the sky the making and on making the bulls news stage it's a book about South Sudan struggles in speaking to James ... last name woman room\nTo get stoned many people both coasts observers folks that were new to you for a kind of a moment to those sort of celebrated the world round and I think one of the problem was that people saw that as soon as one of the south Sudanese project this kind of unprecedented experiment and international state building\nAnd moved on rather than at the beginning of the project which is the international community particularly so much the south Sudanese maybe\nYou will both I think a big national uh\nBut yeah I think South Sudan had an unprecedented coalition of support both among the Africans in the region but also among the wider world not least in the west among European countries in the United states\nIn the book he made the argument that America sometimes described as the midwife assassinate as independents got too close to the south Sudanese to the people who go to ... freedom as the south Sudanese so why what was the problem\nYeah I Do think the United states in particular play to an absolutely critical role a huge role in helping deliver that independence and that is a real achievement but I think\nUltimately overtime that on critical embrace an unqualified belief in righteousness of the cause ultimately blinded some of South Sudan's and the SP alum supporters to the flaws of those chosen heroes and I think ultimately that both\nWarped the political space in South Sudan and it reinforces dynamic in which the south Sudanese elites we're increasingly answer too and we're a derive their legitimacy from abroad rather than from their own people\nThat dynamic is really different now if you look at the way American politicians leaders talk about South Sudan there's little support now has America gone too far away but come to disengaged\nYeah I think we've swung too far at this stage there isn't a lot of concern there isn't a lot of interest about this in the Trump Administration and I think we see that playing out on a day to day basis now where the United states is a two absent from the same\nYou'll say critical says the south Sudanese leadership solve the kid was the accidental presidents and you'll woods or you know very complimentary there by ... the main rebel leader they signed a peace agreement now are they going to have to work together again it's failed Seventy times in the past ten they work together now\nThe million dollar question look I have my doubts\nAnd I had you know I was part of the mediation that helped broker the first peace agreement with alternately failed to produce or the real political transition in South Sudan and I have some of the same doubts now that I did then I think this deal\nIs important if it can stop violence in the immediate term if it can allow humanitarian access if it provides an entry point for the international community the best peace deal in the world won't be implemented without the political will I think we need to think in five and ten and Fifteen year terms and for me that means partnering with youth in South Sudan means partnering with\nThe thirty some things are a lot of politics should be ... locked out around the army\nTotally locked out of politics and have been for too long waiting generational change in their own country I Do have optimism about South Sudan and it's in many ways tied to that generation and so I think the Trump Administration I think western governments I think outsiders would generally do well those to address the immediate term but to start to invest and partner with a new generation and South Sudan\nItaly you'll dealings ways that governing elites who came from a rebellion you ended up as politicians despite themselves in some cases did you get much feeding that they wanted the best country that I prepared to go beyond their own interests and I'm looking at the national interest\nI Do think many of them some of them did have the best intentions of their country at heart but they failed to seize this incredible opportunity they had both apple oil reserves oil reserves that many states would kill for and they had a remarkable reservoir of international goodwill and so they had a real opportunity and I think\nBecause of that history because of they were in many ways disconnected from their own population because institutions went there and there was opportunity for corruption sadly I think they failed in that\nIn season that opportunity I think some of them are repented and some of them have seen what's happened as a result of those failures others I think or not and\nThat in many ways is why I think generational change is the\nFundamental ingredient in a long term transition to a piece in South Sudan\nIn and I'm making of the world's newest book about stuff you don't\nHave anything she needs him with the D.C ...

safeguard and strengthen the dispute supplement system to right now it's really tedious\nLengthy and inefficient to try to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war at the moment that started this summer and it's not great because it floats the WTO rules in which case why should the other one hundred sixty two members of all of them\nAre movies people that are meeting in Canada obviously with trying to in the United states not being invited to the world's two largest economies so how's it going to work\nIt sounds like a disaster and not have them there but at the same time I might be really inefficient to have them there at this early stage so one of the things we could see as a negotiating strategy is that\nThese Thirteen stakeholders are joining Canada for this today ... have ideas come up with some solutions and then present them to the to feuding parties as look this is a nice basis for discussion what do you think what do you like and it really takes something on the disposition and personality and grits and insurance\nOf the people who are committed to multilateral trade to keep doing that I mean not this diplomacy is a state craft and this is stuff that Canada frankly is very good at\nRight in the European Union is very good at it the United states used to be very good at it under US President Donald Trump we've seen him on to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement but she has recently done and\nParis or he didn't want to sign up the United states the Paris climate accord he doesn't like international agreements and he says complaining that the United states spends too much on NATO for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states has a victim China\nSimilarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose\nAnything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate\nOne of the main functions of the WTO that have a lot of polls that they're looking at the international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments to various different tunnels\nWell this is so you've got the United states and the one hand saying that you know we're going to withdraw if the WTO doesn't shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges\nRight who who do all of the education so that sounds inconsistent they would say that this is part of the way of forcing the issue\nForcing the negotiation and we saw the former head of the world Trade Organization amending ... let me say say what you like about Donald Trump by\nHim wanting the trade war with China and threatening to withdraw the United states he has done what many people said needs to be done which is to reform the WTO\nThat was independent research stuff and he had\nQuite an undertaking there tell me thanks [noise]\n[noise]\nI think the last few days you'll be familiar with the caravan of thousands of migrants heading from Central America towards the U.S [noise] they reach Mexico now gaining numbers and attracting political controversy as they go\nThe size of the group is growing from around the thousands it's more than seven thousand according to the United nations estimates President Trump has turned the caravan into a major domestic us political issue to accusing the migrants have been criminals among other things\nFor their part the migrants said many of them are parents with young children seeking a better life away from the violence and the lack of opportunity and in their home countries one of those in the Taliban is twenty nine year old Jose gum is at one time yeah from Honduras he's been speaking to news day about why he's on the move\n\nI'm twenty nine years old on snow for me it's been three years without a job it's ... it's a sacrifice and sometimes I didn't have money to get tiny foods I'm truly scared if I'm honest I'm afraid because this journey is not easy for me this is the first time leaving ... fear\nBut we're not remember the necessity we have about just forces me to continue\nOn even if I Would like to go back I don't\nBecause the third retaliation that the Honduran government has promised us saying that's only one who returns to Honduras risks jail for it up to four years no votes isn't my fear my fear to starving to death that's my fear\nThe only thing I Hope is that Mr Donald Trump opens the doors to us about such because it's been too much sacrifice to get there an end up with nothing we're not going to steal from we're not going to do anything that would be by God's Grace but he can help us\nThat's a Jose again ms ... ah well I've been talking to Daniel ... a reporter for the political news site in the U.S and\nI asked him how he saw President Trump would react if he heard who's his story\nGuess I Would say that the president he makes the case then you can't be allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border and then you know when is it going up and so I think you know Trump was elected primarily\nA in some cases a on a anti immigrant platform in twenty six states\nPromise to stop illegal immigration is so uh he has said that we should have a heart policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of showing the need for these people who are clearly clean desperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line he's rhetoric and so on clearly plays very well to his base with these midterm elections approaching false do you think it works with the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nI think a lot of moderate voters they don't like when Trump uses false statements to back him self up when he was talking about you know unknown middle Easterners\nYou know we in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans were moderates they don't want to use this type of you know racially motivated\nFear mongering that is not even true and you know\nI think it says to his small sliver of his base which is still\nIn about thirty percent of Americans but for Democrats for independence for even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan or immigration policy in general they are do not approve of and so they don't want immigration policies pie run out of\nThe country by a Steven Miller who is very hard right anti immigrant\nA senior policy adviser to\nPresident Trump is also included said Democrats caravans tried to pin the blame as they were on the Democrats is is a topic that the Democrats than just simply trying to avoid in the run up to the midterms or conversely I wanted to kind of ... most possibly\nHelp them in the sense that it might motivate that base perhaps even encourage Hispanic votes is to come out and vote for them\nLet's say a a great point I think Democrats they don't want to be talking about this issue because no political party has a great answer to immigration policy you know we've both presidents of\nDemocrats and Republicans they have tried to tackle immigration reform and they've been stopped a in various efforts and some Democrats want to be talking about health care and the economy and Trump's character and investigating the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but\nReally this effort to split the country and I Trump in terms of this feeling that this is a democratic caravan when are these types of ... I've been happening for the last couple of decades\nHas Daniel Lipman was the Politico a news site\nIt's called little coverage in this uh on the BBC Web sites a beach needs to come including a video made by our correspondent highly ...

done with the twenty second your telling me it can get through the British Parliament but it won't have the support shortly of some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off something members at least of the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll pillow for lots of those who are making the noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the the the new deal that's on the\nTable and they will pay check as all of a so obviously I\nGuess a death is my belief and I think we should than

corporate pacts got him there and that kind of an appeal is\nVery compelling for small dollar donors to see that their donations are not just important but that that the only thing that can help them when\nDoes this reflect than a cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWhat's better O'Rourke and other candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office on small dollar donations that's changing a Bernie Sanders showed that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign powered by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only parts of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of ... boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawns fats artificial intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system he's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on there\nThe message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaign very differently than anyone else has thought possible and I think the true test of better works legacy will be how different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is the million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nWhen he was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle federal\nGlucose his car he losing according to the opinion polls by a percentage points also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment and enthusiasm do you think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in excess of all the university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out to voters that are not being picked up in the polls can you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way at the moment\nThough in terms\nOf ensuring our former president Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been best has stoked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over all may end up being fairly even so how might this translates into success at the polls\nDoes the money even matter that much Donald Trump off rule under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one much academic research have a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential on voters\nSo how should campaigns be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government illegal studies through his ways Leon Media Project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications\nTo voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy\nAdvertisements and to find all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters where would you spend your money if you are running a campaign well I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who\nTraditional live television but I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nUh what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very efficiently with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because\nThat's where the the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nDoes TV advertising still work\nIt does work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently that poll numbers move in that direction so if you could out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign\nYou know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race and all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spend so much money early and campaigns so that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money you can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign\nBut at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and they're not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage if the election is likely to be close\nIf it's a fifty fifty race and you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last you know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to regret regret it and so that's why campaigns\nDo what they do so we're all basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table\nAnd so voters in in competitive districts in states should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next in the next ten days\nProfessor government Mike friends separates to oh this off the ducks political advertising we've been discussing we'd

from not being recycled but no company wants to take the fuss neat because that would depend on how you know making the others that are competing against you know he's been out to start\nWe open and you think well that's being taken care of but no it hasn't been taken care of\nSo now with this ban which will be presumably implanted in all the European Union countries what will be alternatives be and how long do you think it'll take before the ban is enforced across the board\nWe're going to stay in the next two years by twenty Twenty one phasing out of the existing stalks I've just said that

films that you find on new vegetables that protect your tomatoes and you'll\nFruit strengthens replacement so those are not easy to find\nI think that the twenty Twenty one goal that the European Parliament has now imposed is too ambitious\nI think we need to be ambitious I Know that there'll be lots of pain in the industry but that's some plastics that are quite easy to just get out of your life\nAnd I think that we should do as citizens strive to do that what\nWould you suggest that we should eliminate immediately\nWhere you don't need a plastic ... see I mean a lot of the folks are given to you without anyone really thinking through the fact that it's not going to be recycled why doesn't everyone like I Do bring with them and stainless steel cutlery they have it in there by that is done no way\nI Am deeply ashamed I have a plastic fork in my salad currently as I speak to you\nSaid that it's all things that we can do immediately I wanted to do what you think is the real problem that needs looking at now as well which is just the levels of consumption is there a complete re education that needs to happen\nI think there is a re education about people not accepting the stuff that is completely unnecessary ... and he's just essentially consumption for science take like a classic book and life disposable cops on notice I have trouble\nBut I think actually as a systemic change that's about the whole way we run the economy that has to change and that will take longer that will happen soon but it has to happen in my view that everything we make\nWhatever it is whether the shampoo bottle or a car or a mobile phone ring\nOr they will have plastics and by the way someone needs to think about the end of life and they must always come back and specifically cyclic suction autonomy and in my view should be illegal to sell something where you don't know how to disassemble it and put it back into the system\nAnd what you're asking for is a complete overhaul and the way in which we structure our economy because that last point is pretty radical\nIt is radical but the alternative is equally radical which is a complete ruined nation of the season our environment and that is the stock truth of the way in which are linear economy and I say linear by staying next we basically take stuff on the ground we pump it out of the ground we make products which are amazing an ally especially in the west the full of wonderful materials ...\nBut then we have NO PLAN about what to do with all that stuff and of course the economy is all about state came to mind the most stuff but we haven't even watch out what to do with the stuff we don't want anymore and we will just end up with an environmental catastrophe if we do know rethink that linear economy\n[noise] serious salt fat from ... who is a material scientist at the university at University College London\n[noise]\nStart because on the west and Whitman has skewed our ideas of what they

Leah Bessie who is a biological anthropologist at the University of Rhode Hampton in London Welcome to the program I I Wonder how surprised you are by what you found\nWhen I was quite surprised by the

days of a women especially pregnant women to figure it out if there was a defense independent shape and they did find some but they were focused mostly on the European Americans and African Americans\nSo what I did was um and large the simple to undercut the global um diversity in Arabic shape\nLike I said and I said as what you found you studied three hundred and forty eight so needy three hundred and fifty got a sense from twenty four different populations what with the differences that well\nIf you look at the shape but it can be done in putting some percentage African women\nAt the canal is very different from what you find is enough for it and some Native American population for example St subset are not African women it is a more circuit sometime it's actually deeper back
