V.\nAnd that in addition to what we call multi drug resistant tuberculosis it's one of the top five countries in the world and so they had a difficult time in treating patients\nUsing the Jacqueline they were able to find that these very very difficult patients that they were able to actually have an extremely good success rate of Ninety three percent\nIs one of the two new drugs that we have for tuberculosis in the last fifty years ago um this is a ... is a big breakthrough but it points out the need for more\nKinds of drugs like this\nAnd it's important because with tuberculosis you cannot treat with just one drug you must have at least to effective drugs so just in developing one and and just giving that alone is going to cause resistance to that particular drug\n... so so that's the only way to be ... says is to have one drug and combined with the others was does that mean it was simply a case of mixing a cult fell together in the right\nWay and then eventually you know ... bingo you've done it\nRight now since we only have two new drugs that means that you do have to combine them with the drugs that we already know about ... and uh but that's not going to be good enough pretty soon we're going to need additional new medications in order to get to the to the bottom of treating tuberculosis in all its forms\nWhy is tuberculosis so from each points of view so successful tuberculosis is successful\n... it's an organism that can ... lived in your body in a dorm at fashion you can live there for years\nMaybe never even develop if your immune system is healthy you may never even actually develop the actual disease it'll just like dormant in your body and sometimes and then other times if your immune system is weak for example we had HIV when you have diabetes and other a condition that where you're\nThe kidney disease that can actually make the organism come alive again to actually develop to actually develop the D. disease of tuberculosis\nAnd tuberculosis is spreading to to rich countries is that correct\nI think that the tuberculosis is a disease of low and middle income countries in countries like the United states uh the the numbers and the rates are very low but there is something very interesting that's going on in especially in the middle income countries like South Africa China\nIndia needed a country that has some of the highest burdens of tuberculosis there now middle income countries they're rich countries are becoming richer and with that becomes better nutrition and in some cases a lot of obesity why is that important because obesity is linked to diabetes and diabetes is linked to curriculum versus\nIf you have diabetes your risk of coming down with tuberculosis is three times higher so that we can ... the thinking but it's like putting fire\nOn something where you're tuberculosis is common and now you're going to have diabetes adding fuel to that fire and I can see a a growth of the tuberculosis in somebody's especially middle income countries the quarter of the world faces and it is in India\nOkay and then if there is the obesity is going up there then you have the ... the people who have a dormant in their bodies growing in a place like the United states where the where the background a level of tuberculosis very low even when you when you have obesity\nYou're not and diabetes and term it's not you're not going to see the effects as much\nFor ... for countries like India South Africa China the priority will be to fights obesity would die a weed lifestyle and through that way you can be tuberculosis\nAnd that's one of the ways that you were able to beat tuberculosis on you know ultimately what you need for tuberculosis it to make sure that people are treated appropriately with the right combination of drugs\n[noise] took to pull the food you are there for me the rational union against tuberculosis and lung disease telling us about discovery by scientists but to Ninety percent of patients who had about ... a drug resistant tuberculosis or not to send to them recovered very significant indeed\nFour years ago a bunch of friends come up with the deal should you know future film impoverished that I have no money no ... of annoyed yeah we're food and up ...

consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam and in doing so good by polls there are defective automatic partnered\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the will to my way of moving at and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the brain received those messages in a different way yeah another\nReally good

independents not peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible outdoors\nSo it's not a perfect solution from out by the help so do we know how well the ... other people with Parkinson's\nSome study was done and it showed that the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent for those participants off medication and when they were on medication the effect was still positive it was a decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent\nHowever that was a really small sample size earning Nineteen participants in study\nThat small and I wonder how do these you know do they make it stand out as they do a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in one of the early models of this why someone in the Netherlands war on a trade ...

[noise]\nThere are a number of major sporting goods stores that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offer discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they would no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these moves\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impacted the n._r._a. finances we know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents about it's hard to know exactly what that entails\nBut I think one interesting facts of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent filings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars this year on political campaigns one tenth of its spending at the same stage of the twenty four team mid term elections\nWe did try exhaustively to speak to the n._r._a. for this decision of business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available we also failed\nTo get any formal comment from most of those companies who withdrawn from that support the n._r._a. but we did reach one kind of debates for them that was caught up in all of these protests David led the stores the chief executive of mentoring equipment co-op\nIt's a retailer base in Vancouver the price of the Parkland shooting in February was still do some products linked to a significant us weapons manufacturer vista outdoor group\nThere was a petition and trust that had some fifty thousand signatures on it\nBut what we were really watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they're missing twenty thousand conversations that were happening at the time\nAnd it was evident that there was a lot of emotion um a lot of movement on this and we believe that we have to take action based on what you're seeing and what we're finding primary and our social media channels\nSo what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and and really trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that were impacted were long tenure and vendors off hours whose ethics were posted two hours and then to that the holding company\nSo they were very round people um that was the aligned to us that would have been impacted by our decisions\nRight so I mean essentially a with the prime move you made right was to to to stop selling on your show products made by this vista outdoor ... which was you would not selling firearms or ammunition yourself this drought during does manufacture those things\nOr offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey've got it up for sale I don't think it's being sold yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves [noise] goes up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that we looked at this or the ... this was a social decision for us not a political idea ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S and his former politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moves like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the n._r._a. campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but professor Bob Spitzer doesn't think financial muscle is key to the n._r._a. influence anyway\nThe key thing to the ... political influence really hasn't been money\nSo much as it has been the zealous loyalty of its base of gun owners and gun rights advocates who will attend the meeting vote based on the gun issue will make a phone call attended demonstration\nWhen most Americans stay home in two thousand Seventeen for example the n._r._a. spent about five million dollars on political lobbying activities\nIn the context of American politics it's really not very much at all\nTo the un arrays fine and swimming alone despite its claims of ...\nWell the entering does have money problems they spent a whole lot of money in two thousand sixteen election cycle they gave thirty one million dollars to Donald Trump\nThat contributed over fifty million dollars total money they really didn't have money that could have come from Russian sources that's the dark allegation reporting on in the American media in recent months\nAnd their difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner and America is an older white male and that generation is frankly dying off\nBack in the Nineteen sixties one household and two had at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there even though fewer Americans own and have guns the average number of guns owned by gun owners has increased today the average gun owner owns more than eight\nSo let's hear from them rich and Mary Wilcox oh too long to gun owners\nThey live in a rural area and the opening in New York state where they've seen a steady rise in local government restrictions on firearms and ammunition sales they let a reporter skilled at the ... into the house to see some of the many weapons they keep\nThe first one is a three oh wait that would be for deer hunting their New York state has quite a population of bears and are actually starting to get to be a problem because there's too many of them might pistols there that's a forty caliber and this one here with my great grandfather's guns purchased in Eighteen Ninety\nIt's more of a buffalo gun for shooting buys him\nHe's so excited when he comes home and the deer and it's really neat what we can have for dinner as a result of that it's just amazing\nAnd especially like venison with here it's very very low cholesterol because they're wild animals do not like a cow that's eating grass not doing anything all day long I in my lifetime member of the honorary I've been a member of the\nA hunting accident or somebody breaks into your house and you shoot them\nYou know legal fees they just had somebody just recently just shot somebody in their home in the area of a like a burglary yeah they broke somebody broke into their house and I literally carry my postal all the time so and it's loaded for this reason for that reason security\nWhat that does is by me having the gun it gives me a choice if I Need to protect myself or my wife or my family I can do that and if you look at your biggest crime rates in cities are in cities that don't have guns like Chicago has the highest murder rate in the country they have the toughest gun laws in the country\nTighter gun control is like you guys for how'd you guys see that they are\nI think it's a waste I mean they're really chasing the wrong rabbit on this thing it's not a gun problem\nIt's a mental health problem education problem it's society's problem\nI mean when I was a kid people brought their guns to school you go to school to be guns and hanging in the back windows of the car or the trucks that had shooting classes in school\nNobody got shot like they did okay nothing it's it's more of a mental health thing it's more of a societal thing than a gun problem too if you agree or they're going to outlaw guns and the only ones are going to have guns are outlaws\nThey're making criminals out of everyday people I mean I don't have a problem with regulating guns and controlling who has them but you can't you can't just blame blatantly said no nobody can have them good because then you're gonna end up with just\nBad guys having guns rich and Mary Wilcox from a town called water for the New York state well they may be a golf as all the new anti gun measures that they're seeing but this could just be the tip of the legislative iceberg at least according to care Linda extinct progress\nThis is a critical midterm election this year and I think we have candidates running this year specifically on a platform of gun safety and we have a candidate outside of chores I named Lucy McBath\nWhose son Jordan Davis was shot and killed and Florida number of years ago\nAnd this year after Parkland she decided you know what if I Want a candidate who's going to support the type of gun reform and said I Do it should just be me and she is not the only one with the candidates like this across the country I think the environment in the United states is different this year than what we've seen in the past\nHaving voters energizing galvanize over
