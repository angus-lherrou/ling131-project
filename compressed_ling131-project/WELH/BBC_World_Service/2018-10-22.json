stay in the soil and not just the nutrients but also the microbes that the plants rely on to grow to stay on the soil and then the other thing we do is just like we have a micro biome at our guts the soil has a micro biome\nAnd that relationship between the plants and the micro biome is essential for them to grow so what we do is we inoculate the soil with that and microbiology that in a little

World Service my guests today has become one of the world's leading public intellectuals who spoke as much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others through the complex prism of race gender religion class on nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to dig deep into such questions comes from a very personal place\nThe is the child of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and will commit ... politician and pre independence gone to\nHis mother was an English woman of our is the classic stall Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy on law at New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex on multi led a sense of so can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves undefined others often tends to be focused on division we use race religion on a class to separate us from then increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict an eight\nSo is there an antidote to this preoccupation with group on tribe\nWell Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now welcome to talk to the beer you have spent a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels\nHow do you label yourself a little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain\nThat I'm half a gun at enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that are that gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of mixed nuts if your identity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals\nTo your into lucky to er about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals similar faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as I think many people assume uh they they will so I I grew up and got on my father was going to end\nBut that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am in God or it doesn't tell you how much I Know that got us since I haven't lived there for that he is and so on many people that would be more informative to know what their nationality is you know if it's at\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move beyond the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in all of your work on race religion and creed as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can\nIdentify ourselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we're role so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply it in some way or rather misleading\nI think that's right if you take any bill the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even cost you know one of those there's so much diversity within them\nSo you know men are also the men and not the same man is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain are different from running out of the people in London a different from one another in a million ways\nSo that being told that somebody's London it doesn't actually give you a huge grip on or anything are very important about them which doesn't mean that there are moments when being alone there isn't a hugely important to people\nUm there are a mayoral elections ... if you're a London that when when the mayor is being elected if that were big as they have been in the past the terrorist attack in London that would bring them together and have a sense that okay we're all facing this together\nThe current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nAnd it does so but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately are not to miss the new believe that the trajectory of the human condition is in ... in that positive sense toward a more universe list a more\nHumane understanding compassionate humanity I guess how can you square that with what you see well\nUh I I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just\nFive or ten years or penalty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect or in many ways over the last century I'll say for example\nThink about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting to ask people in many many countries over the last century and look at the massive reduction in a racial or discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of the increasing\nComing together of Europe at the same at the moment of these moments of nationalism and putting it to one side which one has to do when you're a ... is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century\nSo uh or even in the mid ... century so I think older they said if you look over long enough horizon\nYou can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nOne area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in the western world\nAh societies and cultures view a gender issues particularly the sexuality I mean your your uh uh uh no not for very long time in out gay man you took advantage of America's change of laws so that you could Mario long term partner\nHow far can we go with the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways that we never even thought of before not just in terms of\nOf sexuality but even in terms of of basic gender where now there is a a very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who find themselves as ... binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be moving\nTo to accept them in New ways where does this and\nWell I don't think he ends the ... there are two things at the airport but where it doesn't that doesn't then with the disappearance of identity we are reforming our gender system but by not getting rid of gender altogether I ... I can ... I Believe that I with along all into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nThere's the question is where the self\nIdentity and because of the interesting late I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on ... not so long ago we spoke to a woman code ritual dollars ... who is white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and on and\nLive a life as a black woman ...\nBoth realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say we want being black is and she said look I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between ... and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of your own race all on their own race is a special category you need to\nIf you if you don't like where it's but you you need to sway the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do which is they\nCreated a movement to allow them to be what they want to be in our system they've asked us to change the system I have I'm happy to respond\nAffirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity to adapt system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I basking in the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nIf racial they'll they'll have could have provided a could have made these arguments have decided to people in the the thing and if you could have done it in the way it was a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about her but\nUnfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments living it that way is if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on her and she has to do with other people just to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you've been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society it's simply to understand and explain how societies work to my fellow citizens and I I get that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nWell I think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identity is leads to to hostility and hatred and division\nThat's the thing the ones that can full so that I think some things can be said a but these are just things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people who live with people of diverse identities tend to be less than people did that so don't allow yourself\nTo be channeled off into a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among 'em straight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people live all the major kinds and do things with them that's not about\nRace or religion or or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about ... in our building something in your community together woods together with people because I think working together with people that die this identities\nMakes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly is to have false ideas about them as long as the falls are leading you to behave badly\nI'm not so worried about the people that false ideas about absolutely everything not just identity level of ideas about cooking and it and if it doesn't do much home I'm not too worried about\nFinal thought we'd have a a thinker and rice or in the United kingdom called David good hot who said that these days the most\nImportant distinction and identity that that one can use when looking at people in western society is between those goals anyways and those sequels some ways now the anyways other highly educated\nPeople who are comfortable in an open intellectual environment living pretty much anywhere in our own country or indeed in the world that would be you and then there's some way as I'm deeply rooted people who are not so low bile whose fault persist as a small localized not so open\nAnd then they according to David good hot I'm much less interested in the kind of\nIdeals that you've just been painting with me\nI Am happy to live in the world with the somewhere as I just don't want them shaping the well for the rest of us in a way that makes us it's a very difficult for us to do what we want to do so if my my favorite example of this is the American example of the Amish in Pennsylvania\nThey close themselves off they don't like talking to strangers and they don't like money they don't like because I like lots of things that I think I'll listen to them as sort of unethical Boston London will and they've made a will to themselves I think they're entitled that I Believe I Believe that that that that freedom is a simple as anybody else's freedom\nBut and they don't do any harm to the rest of them I say their garage into the well campaigning against the others they just live separately I don't mind that I think if you want to be somewhere like that that's fine\nBut if you want to be the kind of someone who wants to take over the United states or Britain and turn it into a country of some was a than I Am a on the other side from you I I I live and let live kind of person I understand the attractions of locality I remember the pleasures of\nOf my grandmother fingers really ... so it's a lovely place that I can imagine a puffer decent life\nOr living there are all the time mostly hanging out with people for them it's not the life that I've chosen and they sort of people who wants to live that life I think that's fine but I don't think they should um ... shape of world in which what I wanted to do is impossible\nAnd we have to end the ends up here it's been a pleasure having you on hold just very much doctor for a

economics think tank in Washington DC\nYou have a country in its elite which has a very large existing debt and doesn't because of structural features like an aging population et cetera have prospects for growing very fast in the future\nAnd a country like that or if you suddenly stopped running significantly larger deficits than had previously been agreed it is a warning signal\nAnd that is why the European authorities right now are taking a very close look indeed at these new Italian budget proposals because they are actually\nMaking it clear that this government wants to run a deficit that's about one and a half percentage points larger than the previous government\nSo that puts them flashed on the ... and what makes it ... the economy in particular so vulnerable to that because some saying this could be the next flash points to the next global economic crisis\nIn somebody's of the signs it's a little bit like what we saw a earlier in the euro crisis if you get to the point where investors are no longer willing to buy any Italian debt that they basically\nBelieved that the Italian government finances are unsustainable well then you have a full blown crisis in the euro area once again because at that point in time either the euro area or more likely the European Central bank\nWould have to intervene so the signals that you look for here are really the difference in

causes of this big migration pushes a basically violence and lack of economic opportunities ...\nDays support or this cooperation from the U. S. I usually go to Stuart security initiative on the other half towards various economic development and social development project so it is kind of counterintuitive to try to caught you know the funds that actually focused on what is the root causes of this\nSo you know saying that if those governments that receive age in the United states the more reason for people to prosper and their own country\nThat is actually what has been happening the cooperation from the United states to this country's have more and more fuckers precisely in this type of initiative\nLike now it's got to happen like and and some of this project's actually show advancement in this topics specifically so yes these are the things that we know that have worked and they start as I mean this is a long process but that are starting to work and caught in it or does not help but\nSaid President Trump's supporters would say that that aid has been wasted because it hasn't gotten rid of the problem corruption still rice across ... countries\nThe power of the criminal gangs is gripping city senses and towns around the whole region and this age issue as opposed to them as pets and the more you give them all the countries need where does it end\nFirst of all I think that the problem is that if you pretend to try to solve a problem\nThat is very long time and a very short time it's very complicated we're talking about countries that there years ago were at war the democracies are starting even view and I'm not saying that I agree with this but there's a lot of people that actually could responsibility of the current situation on us and us intervention or do end this war is an afterwards\nI Do believe that this project how old so this is a slow process but this is the one process that works if you say well we're going to close the border are we going to stop ate\nWhat is that going to do is that going to help you know what's going to help ... case the U.S\nHow able all the old so it's easy in these various countries to stop this kind of um of migrants posing through that countries\nThe problem is what's going to be the solution of what you can do about it if you're gonna you know accept them as refugees and try to establish camps that are going to have support in order to those is because without support it is very limited what those governments can do and\nWhat shape that takes is definitely going to be very political and that is the other thing right the rhetoric and the elections being so close\nAlso make this a little bit more complicated this is not a problem of today this carbon is not the first carbon but definitely it's put in pension and more pressure because of its disability\nWhat other options on that are available to the United states to try to stop so many illegal migrants coming through\nI think a lot has to do with the conditions in the countries and promoting migration that is documented and that is legal the other thing is that we do see lower numbers of integration in there are more\nImmigrants crossing and everything but it's in much lower numbers that it was five years ago and it specifically for Mexico you see that a lot definitely what needs to be done his support this concrete on the other thing that needs to be done is promoting migration that it's orderly\nThat document that that is that it that is checked because the other part of the migration he's the man and the real fact is that the U.S unemployment is under what it has been in decades and there is any mind for this labor\nUp ... with the into American dialogue group in Washington DC and we'll be heading lived to the U.S in a few minutes sent to our and James ...\nDistribution of the b._b._c. news over the U.S has supported by home advisor measuring homeowners were home improvement professionals river Rodney King projects from repairs to remodel ... reviews and book appointments home on home advisor dot com\nAnd progressive insurance committed to offering a streamlined shopping experience for home when Pato can be bumble together no bats progressive more and more progressive dot com for one seat on the progress\n[noise]\n... book published radio port we saw me about fifty for the afternoon and women's west fire ... miles an hour and provide some clouds Missouri's tomorrow cloudy a chance of showers drifters Wednesday partly sunny\nMaybe some showers you're damn low fifties for the heart\nOr the reason why we asked them on the wall so I was I Want him in a part of the states were dairy farmers protect appreciate or he did a good deal with Canada\nCan I ask you what one of the things that place do you think you're telling this story you'll economic stories of good news story why I think we still so close\nTo the better safe in many ways it's got a ... a ... got urban areas you got rural areas suburban areas and the other challenge we have\nHistorical or you look when ... when Bill Clinton was President George W.

policy it's a shame you know and I think people who are maybe more on the fence it doesn't rise and so a lot of Republicans feel that way\nThey're looking at the president and once he does\nAnd that will affect the voting for governor for Senate races it has a big impact\nAnd there's a lot of independent so I think and then that's going to have a big effect on the election\nAnd is your sense than
