it\nScientists use a brand new more reliable method of measuring the gases in the ad in the past they've relied on taking millions of different spot measurements in the ocean floor is blind date directed the research she's an assistant Pacific professor of geosciences at Princeton environmental Institute in the U.S\nOcean warming has been estimated for the past decade using ocean temperature like direct measurements of temperature and there were some discrepancy before two thousand seven before we had an array of flu\nThat measure temperature everywhere and so there were some discrepancy between the different estimates of ocean warming even though they use the data and so the idea what can we find another way of that meeting ocean warming and other methods any independent her temperature data and that could give us an entire nation\nAre we on the top range in the lower range and that's how we started the study\nAnd what is it Masha how a woman the oceans are\nSo many kids if we underestimate the amount of warming that goes in the ocean that means we underestimate the amount of warming on earth and that means we underestimate the sensitivity of the earth to our
