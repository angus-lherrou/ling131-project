understanding\nAbout certain\nGame development techniques or you know certain mechanics\nOr various things that you know cameras will understand intuitively most people who are not cameras will not

has enough steps that you can play it for you know the three five months of your recovery [noise] the balance chests\nAre are designed so that the physio therapists can measure specific strengths and specific improvements in your balance as your training so when you first come in they can get a baseline and they'll do you know static balance test or a dynamic sound stuff depending on what you were

R. J.\nAnother example of the problems is there's a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that\nCitizens are illegally registering and voting because again that's not jak that's a problem and is the problem that in many states you're not show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place give them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are stirring up a specter for problem where there was really a problem\nHow you respond to that while I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of law back in two thousand a what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election\n[noise] it would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and is probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\n... taking the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking about fixing to unfortunate packing the focus oppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them requiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a big patronizing I think and frankly borders on racist to believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose curious the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with old most surgical precision I oh tons if he could understand why African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who are suing said was this is going to a depressed turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready boom and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the ballot the mold and fight the voting rights in America he's not a tool convinced that any of us should be worried about voter fraud I think it's\nA very small problem and one that has been exaggerated\nI think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county here or a county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and has made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out truly need to do something about it I think it's a\nVery very very small problem and there are targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution\nA lot more people have been prevented from voting and fraudulent votes cast that there are many many more people that are being blocks from the polls\nThat have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually fraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem\nIs that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or to sway from participating\nBecause of barriers that have been erected to the ballot box what evidence do you have\nThat they actually do I think there's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduced voter turnout and at a reduced voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee\nRepublicans have claimed many different occasions that these laws have helped them whether it be that it out and Gary key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and I think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that you are people that are going to participate but\nAlso the last election in North Carolina state board of elections did a careful review and they found tons to five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have isn't that evidence of vote to rose I almost Ari\nIf you look at the case then from there weren't covered most of the time they weren't ex felons\nWho didn't realize they were in algebra I don't know there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they cast a ballot because there is a very very steep price to pay when you're talking about potentially a facing ... years in jail a steep fines\nAll for one vote and most people would not do that if they knew what the penalties for being\nMost of those ex felons didn't in the end face any further action docked in elements county twelve people were prosecuted\nAnd they soon became known as the elements twelve me can

law\nAnd we ... and saw that the climate been committed I think they're important laws that we do a enforced\nSay we didn't know that we're in breach of the little\nState board in the files you the kind of covering left to sedate acknowledged that some of the paperwork it'd be very confusing I Wonder what you might have about ... well with the criminal law it's\nAlways difficult to proven to it and these cases it's actually stripped tort liability crimes so we're not required by law to prove the intent but I Will say that in each case when we reviewed it\nActually signed a certification under penalty for being prosecuted for describe\nVicki I spoke to yesterday he was one of the twelve prosecuted she said to me that the penalty for breaking the election go by voting when she was none of us but we are so high that she'd have to be crazy to do it deliberately it's obvious that it was a mistake do you have any sympathy for ...\nYou know and we did these cases it's about accountability for actions um which is is one of the threshold for the criminal law you know and this also serves as a deterrent some people have\nSpoken out and criticize me for it but I think just

hospital\nFriday the fourteenth of September [noise]\nI'm Laura hunger investigative reporter with the Courier Journal I'm working on a story about babies who are born withdrawing from drugs\nMy name is dawn forums and I am and the innate colleges I take care of sick babies that are in the ICU um after they're born citizen you know I see you [noise]\n\nNewborn babies are not born addicted that is a common misnomer but addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies their infants that\nWere exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure for long enough lead to a dependency\nAnd because they became dependent on that stuff to what's airborne and they no longer have that substance being provided they become at risk of going through withdrawal and what sorts of um withdrawal symptoms debates so babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI systems so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms though they breathe fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kidney I which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their well being so babies are in control of oil and crying that is babies don't handle that you and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for\nHours with as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick babies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crime\nThey sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down up stay the same certainly as I say I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly increasingly we've had at seven hundred percent increase in substance affected and sent in the past decade\nIn Kentucky or national nationally and at the trends in Kentucky are probably leading that fact\nShe's one we go today [noise]\nShe had some problem she breathed in some of the flood when she was coming out and she has slid on her lungs so she had to come up here to the NICU

cold chills sometimes increase in muscle tone so she ... and her so can the rooting she um [noise]\nSucks a lot more than other children would I mean it's really hard because you think you know I I

they don't really go induction do it they just tell you the basic stuff that you need to know [noise] like yeah like common sense dislike\nLaw school I think they care more about other stuff then ah they rather stop the stupid things like you oh you got to just go you know in his wrong instead of whether you have something in your life to view of all that always\n... just don't want to go\nOutside and soldiers were there when I'm In class and all the people that are that I noticed smoke when teachers asking those the the little was questioned ah\nAh oh no [laughter]\nThose as

I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context if you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time of the birth rate in the states with about seven\nPer woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states and Europe\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skill workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new bodies if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThen the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks who come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing\nOr global economic changes re ... son um editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S.\nCurbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of the classic American narrative that's of the panelists immigrant who arrives to seek a new life on through hard work and determination\nGoes on to cross the and thrive so would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration all through the United states is often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world [noise]\nIt's a question I put to the Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of immigration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war prior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship\nAnd image grants were welcome to that is white people were welcome to there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nAnd there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants so when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and this is connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens\nAnd people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship now after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created and this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a stream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth of twenty of centuries\nHas applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen to the early twentieth century of large European immigration where there's the pose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who are coming into the country today it's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority\nOf immigrants do not fall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor low educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there's not upward mobility for them\nAs a dean theories and American immigration history when the opportunity\nA Latin American immigrant with the same as as for European\nNo there have even more recent on that doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that historically those populations have been permanently marginal\nClear that you're on a different and the political spectrum to ... the editor of the national
