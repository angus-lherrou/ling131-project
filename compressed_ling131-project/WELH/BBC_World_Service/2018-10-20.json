World Service remember if you like the program I Would like to hear some more of our recent shows that are available as podcasts wherever you get your podcasts\nWe're trying to find out the truth behind a video about men spreading that went viral in Russia videos that according to a European Union website was in fact a piece of propaganda\nOne two Oh yes a lot better I lost it either that's Josh Russell you had that testing the microphone funny thing about him\nKind of leaves a double life by day he's a systems analyst by nights he becomes a Russian troll ... to\nKnow yeah I Do it totally for fun I live in Indiana it's cold here right playing video games at night and if you don't have TV it's sort of what I usually do and uh at the current moment I'm into hunting down these Russian trolls\nAnd just to be clear he does it's totally free as far as we know he's not on the payroll full any security or intelligence agency that's Jesse ... he goes out of his way to identify social media accounts that are deliberately and openly staring arguments on line\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic work that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing a Josh has a background in programming and I see\nShe understands social media and he knows the mind of a troll because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nA room uh\nHaving followed dozens of Russian troll accounts having studied that'd be have yet Josh is in a great position to tell us wanting to mission wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of this man's spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see these\nRussian trolls or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again they're\nGoing to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their\nState funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information right\nBut I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles wanted\nThat's Dr molten Bayh he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan [noise]\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some fans to key issue with the casting choices you see never before I had to stall will still had so many women in ethnically diverse act has thing prominent roles in fifth got some fancy evening\nTime questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten got curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Bryan Johnson\nSome of them except for their behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nAt the state you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film\nSays regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before the election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kinda have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily ... level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter\nLet's stick to digest that it's not the divisions haven't always existed in society ... example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices there would always be some people who agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... All right what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating de spaces and sending up the volume as you were if those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe ... is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments to video gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's slowly bound to increase the divisions in societies that are well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points or you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that are rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only concerned is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program Ken we conclusively say that ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggesting if you're looking for a smoking gun here\nThen we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode separately fits into a broader pattern one very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's the ... campaign\nThat's it this week for BBC trending on my ... and I'm Marco silver the program was mixed by James Beard production helped\nHim from a nice ... and from BBC Monitoring Olga Robinson\nAs usual do get in touch we love to hear what you think we're on Facebook and we're on Twitter just like us up BBC trending\nWe'll be back same time next week here on the b._b._c.

silence is part of ... all the big thrown my experience is that the the victims are fine but they are side by did throw them\nThen they are silenced by history because the Palestinian story was never hurt because there was another story which was covering it\nAnd for the world which means Europe the other story was bigger because it was beautiful made that story that does the Holocaust was done by

chime with what he was saying about\nIt I mean I think one of the things that he's trying to do it as he says he's trying to give voice to the victims that are written out of history and I think that that uh the world over the world down there and I think that in some ways retelling stories such that the victims of the Holocaust are not meant to be cowards are making out the Palestinians\nWho ended up being expelled or remained or do we tell their story in ways that allows for them to be incorporated re incorporated into the stories we tell about our past it's been something that actually

in such a bind\nIf they can possibly get through this crisis with things very much on an even keel as far as possible in the bilateral relationship I think that is clearly the favorite cost them

simple design and what I saw of course when I got there in the morning before it opened with people starting to line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it open to be among the first customers of legal candidates in the country\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years\nAnd you know others said they never thought they'd see something like this in a lifetime so when the door open to attend in the morning first customers walking you know a big cheer corrupted and throughout the day and people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of of that day that legalized ... Canada\nCanada goose is only the second country over to Europe wide to to legalize cannabis legalize why this decision well the reasoning by the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian use minors teenagers and so on\nSo they said look we're going to try and bring in this you strict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective is the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners\nProfits out of the hands of criminals and would reduce it some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then\nWell just briefly what it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a license producer\nAnd possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form\nAnd you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork sign some places you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example cat his most populous province you can use it offends the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes he would use tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it still illegal to buy it on the black market\nTo possess over thirty grams there actually is a new infractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison now of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development older\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so there are concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concern about the development of the fetus\nSo again both organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions now we were hearing a lot about a green rocks\nTo the economy that this development could have water people thinking about that in the months up the legalization\nHere in Canada I mean one of the headlines you saw almost every day it was just talking about the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea Canada statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen they found that Katie and used or spent rather about five point seven billion dollars on candidates\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely they absolutely ... and\nAcross the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada's taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government is able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think there may be you know obviously\nOther countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out\nThat was Jessica Murphy in Canada and that's it from the will this
