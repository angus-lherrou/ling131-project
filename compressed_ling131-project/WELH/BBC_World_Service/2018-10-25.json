beautiful clothes posing to the camera\nWith the hatch said thanks Michelle Obama and it it went viral it ended up in a lot of the conservative on line newspapers it was kind of funny because all of my previous week before that are where the tweets of obviously not a high schooler\nRoom uh\nHaving followed dozens of Russian troll accounts having studied that behaves yet Josh isn't a great position to tell us wanting submission wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of dispense spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern\nThat you see these Russian trolls or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these terms man's spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic ...\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n[noise]\nThat would come by itself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly\nHe's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the union yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good imbalance\nWhen ... the less jet I came out last year some sounds two key issue with the casting choices you seat never before has style will still have so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten\nCurious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at directing Ryan jumps and\nSome of them executed behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I ...\nLike they might be from Russia that were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls I've been sort of themselves and American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nAt the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before the election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer a tactic that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not that divisions haven't always existed in society ... example whatever people's thoughts would about the costume choices than would always be some people who agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... our rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating de spaces and sending up the volume as each one of those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs your says anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace is a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because of the ways so provocative\nIt's solely bound to increase the divisions in societies that are well already divided\nIf you're sympathetic to honest points uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repelled\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that a rabid conservative writers are spinning out of control on the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias\nThen divvied year will only concern is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of the senseless political correctness brigade inaction [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program Ken we conclusively say that and as video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggests if you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one\nWe can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode says when he fits into a broader path and one day\nThe ... campaigns but at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and as video which raises a valid point I suppose is an active propaganda\nWell I'm going to let John ... the Russian troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real in goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about what they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be on verified information or this\nViral retreating is very viral three that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing and to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what\nYou're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we said before think twice before you share or retreat [noise]\nMarket silver reporting with Mike when link coming up after the break which

Research Center for forensic science at the university oh dum de\nWhy is it that ... children sleep student loans do you know the dying\nThe answer at the moment is no we don't which is probably not hugely helpful and what we do know is that the children and don't sleep through or don't appear to sleep through the conventional smoke alarms that we all have in our houses\nAnd the two studies that you mentioned one is ours and you play the sound from from the piece of work that we did and that work has now been corroborated by uh the study that you mentioned in the United states though the two research groups were not linked um and they looked at the mother's voice of the so the the actual\nRecorded voice of the mother of the children and they found that to be more effective than the conventional we start a conventional smoke alarm sound but the the the answers we don't know actually why this is happening\nI mean you gave evidence or in a court case in to the deaths of six children who died in a back in twenty twelve and they all died of smoke inhalation even though they was smoke ... when the wind tossed really tragic case sat on I I Wonder whether you now know that it's the mother's\nVoice that is effective and not the fault of his voice not a male voice again is it's\nA it's a very good point and it was my restrict students like at the evidence don't know me so just to make sure that we have that correct and so what we found in our study is ops at we used a female voice we didn't use the mother's voice and I think there's more work to be done to see whether or not that always\nTo be in fact female and I suspect that it just needs to be a voice at will be my my suspicion there's been some work done in coal with colleagues in Australia around different types of voices to be\nSo it doesn't appear to necessarily need to be the mothers always I'm busted his a voice that that seems to be the thing that triggers the children to wake up\nWell given that ... to ... do you think then they should change the way that we think about fire safety I mean should smoke ... now have the human voice in and when the noise of Vietnam\nI think that there's something to be said about that and I think certainly for 'em smoke alarms in houses where there are young children and when our work looked at children under the age of about fourteen after where there are young children what we certainly know is that\nSmoke alarms without voice don't always wake those children up so what we're not advocating is that people shouldn't do smoke alarms it's it's exactly the the the other at a different message people should you smoke alarms but they need to be aware that conventional smoke alarms may simply not wake their children up so they are going to need to go on to wake their children up themselves\nBut when you told them when you talk about what you are advocating what happens often a research paper like this do you then got an advice I'm On hospitals you know you go to schools you get to talk to parents how does it work\nFor the work that we did hear it on the am absolutely we we began to a a piece of work with um our local city council and on that that initially was to raise the awareness um around the fact that conventional smoke alarms ... wake up children\nAnd so they worked with her to prepare documentation information that they went into all of the local authorities schools wouldn't in deep\nI think there's a wider peace here though because I think that there's a a a challenge and to be thrown up to those who make smoke alarms and to address this issue the issue is really serious and I and and there's there's there's certainly not the underpinning research to show\nThat we do need to use a different type of sound in
