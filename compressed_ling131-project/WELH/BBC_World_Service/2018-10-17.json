because colonization\n... yes but it's not efficient is that sustainable as the world begins to demand more food as people grow as families growing size as the need for more food production increases it's sustainable to retain those traditional modes of\nPractice yeah it is so long as we're bringing technologies will bring 'em ... knowledge that you resist that specific technologies that are

abandoned gym or food imports but it was covered Donald field trials or GM crops and commercial caught some on Mays could be a possibility in the future\nOther governments are also looking at is

tied into paying international seed companies who or many of the ...\n... from the Rockefeller Foundation hunting\nThat philanthropy are imposing any kind of are genetically modified\nAgricultural policy wiped out the seeds that can be prioritize just serve you did all of that is the decision of government philanthropists got an update the particular seat and bring it in the country I Believe that most of the rejection of new technologies\nAre mostly emotion now leaving motivated my point of view is that we really need to increase our research ...\nWhich about these things to be able to make curriculum and ...\nThere was I think I'm not an founded through to fuel GMOs are they effective at the onset to issues of nutrition that we face on the continent\nAnd then also there's the whole thing concern around big companies coming in and dumping cheap products from the African continent it's a real danger we also have to realize companies I in business to make money to make profits and they will always be tensions between making profit and improvement of life\nAnd who is the rights of betrayed to ensure that we don't end up in a situation way Africa once again become so dependent on

improvements specifically seeds or fertilizer or other ways for them to work or affordable for them given their local conditions\n... some farmers of sort of worried about the book to our group is focused on one of those cultures of scientific solutions they usually too many chemicals on both with the prospect of genetically modified seeds and also losing the traditional crops and began to push control\nBe worried about some of the ... message would\nYou say to them through issues um\nOh I think it's extremely important to the farmers\nHave a very specific voice in this in terms of what they're looking for and what they need so we hear those farmers voices but we hear them very loudly on traditional crops like father\nWhere they do have passed and they've had a mark decrease in their productivity and so looking at newer methods and looking at scientific ways to think about\nHow to make sure their productivity on traditional crops\nStays hire gets higher is an important thing we've heard from farmers\nThe other thing I Would look at at I Would feel reassured by is the governance of Allegra so ARPA is governed by a board of directors where there are many many local African voices and they are making sure that there's not one voice and specifically the concerns about multinational companies and the role of\nBig agro or big corporations is appropriate and not overweight so one of the best ways to make sure that local voices are heard is to have local experts [noise]\nLogical seed company just also metropolis of under both live for\nHybrids which are most dramatically motive

hybrid seeds to retain quality first edition of the seats can be saved on pasta down the generations so what about those who fear that they might lose control but they'll turn them\nBecause they're traditionally summers up their own way of doing things\nThey have been growing from time immemorial dreams or something that they are not used to you have to convince the white but it's good to be different what is going to happen to their own safety seem to save the other thing\nThat that fear that I went to lose how'd\nYou respond to those fears because their gender ...\nGenerally they're very generous and the only way you can it's funded by demonstrating\nWhat what are they telling them because if I come to an say that my centuries old variety which takes amazing little guy make developing to be replaced by something that there's more technologically advanced what'd you say to them to reassure them\nYes that is a big challenge especially from a very accepting the lead but you're the most streets by blending a doubt you all their most or the bus station or we'll blender them\nTo see the difference in terms of the systems in terms of productivity if it doesn't produce more than the other problem if it doesn't taste as good if I'm already dictates technology is something that you cannot see what\nAbout the idea that western philanthropists tough too much influence over the whole control of the seats which is another fear that some small scale farmers up mentioned\nAre greater than African institution for a very very little to ...

will come from sub Saharan Africa that's according to the un population fund ... executive director Natalia ... is in the studio with us great to have you with us from Talia\nNow before we speak to you let's hear from Sheryl ... a young mother living in Nairobi\nMy mother had six children\nSequel do they do get that far and I have friends that have children but they got the ... they can't take them to work who\nJust because they have no job and they have no enough money [noise] I like to see if I may need to gain a leading to any bucked off and not getting a ... not getting enough food they know what to see the mother dressed men I'm not around on us to see that to bring it doesn't need but we made\nA Natalia shower they're kind of laying out all the challenges that face the family faced the women and the children of course you know lack of proper education lack of proper nutrition and economic uh\nYou know economic effects of course where do you begin to deal with all these problems\nSimon the reports that you want to be a present today makes it very clear of sorrow story makes very clear the choice is in short supply\nWomen should be at the center of deciding wants to be a mother how many children they want how to space them and adolescent girls often our mothers too soon the question of choice affects every country there is no country on the globe or we can really say that reproductive choice about fertility is operating today\nAnd tell us more about about family planning unconscious contraception that concept of choice let's hear from shower again\nYou're not going to send of mine and my mother both of them they don't believe in using family planning\nFor I think they should at least try and do some planning we called the ... like me for example me my thought when I did not ... that was the didn't call it no one knows they have to tell me how to use it but my second one is that Black Death but I saw him he had these type yeah and but I'm not that I can go next to feed them\nShirt that that was ... and Italian it's interesting you mentioned choice but what sure I think is also talking about is the culture is the information as well is that getting through\nThis is exactly the point that\nThe decision about when to have a baby is one of the most intimate the citizens and many people are making this decision without preparation without access\nThere are over two hundred million women who would like to have the ability to plan their family as shower decided to do but do they have access in the clinic or they welcomed\nFrom having a baby too soon all of this implies that choice could change a life that could change the family and sharing your story shows us the benefits of being able to plan your family\nThe benefits of having I Would say uh all the supports including things like childcare including the ability for a girl to finish her education and the health system must be equipped to help women all over the world to make these decisions what\nWhat then what is the un population on proposing needs to happen what changed needs to happen in those coming years to be able to contain this\nAs you've said we're predicting an additional one point three billion people by the year twenty fifty if women cannot take the reins of their own fertility control whether one of them how often that they want to have a baby\nThe policies of governments the uh nurses in the clinic\nEverybody who uh deals with the question of wanting to delay pregnancy wanting to have safe sex these are things that we need to talk about more and we also have to deliver the services at the point where the woman can reach a the services achievement\nHowever what what you're talking about often you know Charlotte speaking but there are countries were women don't have that choice don't have the control over their bodies they don't have the control over when to marry one to have a child there there's still a great deal of gender discrimination of depriving many women have the power of that choice\nThe heart of the matter is exactly this men and women are equal but women are the ones that are disadvantaged when choices taken out of their hands\nNot only the information but the services and the expectation that a girl should be able to fulfill her potential this is what the report is showing very clearly\nWere falling back and we can't sit back and relax and things and things the job is done in that regard we need to bring\nContraception services understanding to young people in particular they're the ones who are not going to be able to reach the job market they're the ones who are not going to be able to fully participate in the economies of building up their country what\nDo you think you're up against are you up against a cultural problem are you up against resources or if you are you up against ... at the lack of dissemination of information in certain areas\nFor us and you want to have a fundamental things\nIs that women have rights and women and girls have to be able to exercise those right so the barriers or institutional their social there in the very health system these inequalities where women are not respected and they're not given the wherewithal to be able to reach all of the things that ... spoke about why not\nMake the whole system woman centered why not make policy woman censored deliver everything that she needs to her doorstep according to her choice we think that the rights and the choice argument go together\nTo give the control to women absolutely Italian thank

you're fat\nOr loss of a senior people arriving at the summit amongst those speaking as they entered was the French finance minister Bruno the math\nOr he said we are not far from a deal so that's the

negotiate the free trade deals full we have no ... in those announced that they're doing the no fly zones in the south\nUm but that means we stay in some form of customs arrangement which means no trade deals because the facts all that this is a binary choice said the real question is the new facts that it's actually a shift in political position\nAnd that's the problem and the moment to reason they has that she knew Rico room on any shift in ... and they used to\nAnd if there is no deal done by the time tonight that much we will leave with no deal which most commentators believe will be pretty catastrophic for the u._k. come to me I'm not grades either for the you twenty seven particularly around\nCan I ask a legal opinion of water border becomes on the twenty ninth ... because\nOf the moment we say the snowboarder well actually the ... because you've got different currency on one side of the boat or the other you go up different tax systems the different social services systems there is a kind of a border when people say no border they made the wrong checkpoints there on the horrible business that I grew up with in the Nineteen eighties seeing the militarization of the border um it\nIs that legal concept of border which might help on the side tried to ... pounds of this this kind of double bind that you've described\nIs really tricky the the real problem what's what's going on here is um the physical infrastructure on the boat and that's the issue because the moment you have any form of physical infrastructure\nAnd by that means cameras all security and the thing of that so the real concern is it becomes a target of terrorist interest\nWell you don't have to ... to pay any money to play the game was down there again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to sort of cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really a a money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season policy and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that\nPlayer Brandon Lucas so yes ... is accused of making these tax to the game and setting them\nAnd these are enable players to cheat basically so he's made these include ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you automatically\nSo he's been selling these modes to the game online\nAnd for upwards of two hundred pounds in some cases wow and yet and people are buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas annoying for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people are cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is essentially we're talking about hacking into the software Fortnite\nThat's right that basically accusing the paper of copyright infringement that saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have spoiled it essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one there surely at the games should be targeting everyone who does\nWell this is in fact because his argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says or not some notes of other people doing this you know why they picked on him\nUm and you know I think epic haven't been care about the only thing they would probably argue that they're trying to make an example of someone you know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's this tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry I Know\nThey had some people the rest of it I think in um uh this is a different game actually paranoid about two grounds and that it has to be arrested in China for hiking the game um yeah and an historic day it's been going on for years there's always been cheating games and like many things really gets in the video games journalist joining us life\nNo was cheating and all sorts of games um thank you I understand a bit mono twenty two minutes possibly out now Canada has just become a the second country to fully legalized recreational marijuana consumption on so you look why was pushed the protests began a few hours ago it was midnight struck\nFirst Newfoundland and the eastern most parts of the country it's removing a across to great celebrations Christmas Neal yeah each of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was that in the provincial capital St John as midnight struck so who was sending the first such\nIt's a company called are called canopy gross it's actually white or a large multinational company and uh they set up shop in St John so they will be selling it to you know over the counter here um there are about three locations here is in St john's area that\nYou can walk in off the street and by the candidates but for for now for the most part you'll be ordering it online it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor\nAnd uh they've brought in all the rules and regulations companies had to fly\nIn order to be able to sell it legally there are about twenty two locations\nOff in a in the country right now that can separate story in the profit right now they can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government so while it is regulated by government largely a lot of private companies\nHave their eye on this already and we've got in first that if the company that already um that had already set down the heck with down Bruce than other parts of the world\nAnd I was the time zones move and midnight goes across the country or are we expecting the same sort of policy atmosphere and scenes that you'll see the\nOh I Would I Would say so St john's is a rather small city\nAbout a couple of hundred thousand people and saying this excitement tonight is is quite amazing though I Would imagine across the country if you look at larger cities but millions of people some of them are Canadians I've wanted that for a very long time and that when Justin Trudeau ran to the prime minister of the country he promised\nPeople he would take 'em take marijuana out of the hands of the of of the illegal trade of the drug traffickers adds up\nAnd regulated in an attempt to to grow an industry and I guess a lot of people in the world right now we're looking at candidate to see what Canada is going to do because ... is the only other country in the world that\nHas a federal law that legalize cannabis the United states has done so in in a number of states and some countries have done it within safe but Canada is really a leader\nAnd a lot of people will be looking at houses on hold it will not be without bumps and pick up\nFrom law enforcement to actually whether there's even enough marijuana that's the one thing we've been hearing that the last number of days that they expect the demand will be so great in the beginning that a lot of the flyers are probably going to run out even within the first few days\nAgo right is it because it's such a stampede or the basically the country's gonna be smoked empty do you think\nWell exactly that's what it will be but people will have to take it and bring it home or ticket in\n... in private because it's governed by the same rules as alcohol or smoking\nThat's Chris O'Neal yeah H in St Joe Newfoundland or she was reporting middle to upper ... behind her queuing up for their legal kind of his uh for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\nIt looks like the cash will start flowing into the massive England\nFourteen billion dollar deal has been signs at Davis of our business desk is here with us now match is his third year old project finally ... going to get off the drawing board and actually make some money\nTo suddenly looks like it the ... three hydroelectric projects has been delayed many many times but now deal has been signed\nSo last year the deal seat government off to compete you can sort of you to join forces the company to build the Three Gorges dam in China and Spanish Company called ACS and now looks like a deal between those street ... pious as being penned\nAnd it's being money being delayed and his had all sorts of new goes I mean it's been a long time coming two years ago the world bank a froze the displacement of Seventy three million dollars of its cash that it was putting into a helpful technical assistance because it said\nThat country has taken the project in a different strategic direction than had been agreed\nTo tell us about the significance of the scale of it how big it is\nIt's huge um I mean the idea for the Angus three is to compliment the two existing power stations on the Congo river there about two hundred and sixty kilometers downstream from ... in a fool's\nAbout those two power stations are pretty old no one was built in Nineteen Seventy two and one in Nineteen eighty two so this new project as well as a Jew or it's go fix phases and\nWe'll take more than ten years to complete complete it'll generate four thousand eight hundred megawatts of power now that's about the same amount of energy as three nuclear power stations China\nDoes the DR see neater use that much power as\nWell as it doesn't but it means that the power supply in the B or C can be expanded way beyond the ten percent of the population who currently have reliable electricity supply\nWhich is of course great for economic growth and also be a boost for the country's ... province in the southeast this is where will they mining takes by some mining uses a great deal of energy\nAnd it also means that the deal sea can be a big power export to to the rest of Africa not just its neighbors but as far south as South Africa ah which has actually already signed an agreement to take power from the ... project\n[noise] huge prospects then for the are the match many thanks Matt Davis and out of our business desk joining us

sent me take this week because everyone's quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um but what is happening is the talks are continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there's an impasse and it's not surprising that the issue of\nNorthern artist and the island of Ireland is the issue as to what's drawing agreement if you like still has to be completed on because remember it isn't just the ... you or\nMe as an Irish semi pie or the our government insisting on this the United kingdom the bushes prime minister\nLast December signed up to\nAnd I sort of

paper\nFor example but I'm going to propose changes I guess one you won't agree with all of them but you take some on board that\nHas not happened in these negotiations what is happening and this is a

future relationship we'll\nAgree to this if you're like timing and the customs arrangement temporary customs arrangement and didn't away trying to actually like reverse the future\nOf Reverend Wright's making sense it is human lands\nBut I I Am very aware of the people in Britain around the world there is a great deal of complications but if I pick what you seem to be saying is that the British Government led by ... is written aging on commercials me when it comes to this so called Irish ...\nIf I Want to tease out what I Would but I'm not using it I think she hasn't delivered yes on promises made that is a big stack from saying she's ... and\nI understand the pressure that cheese on there were not blind to the politics of the conservative party I'm not blind to the fact that the ... is propping up the conservative government there is a budget votes on the twenty ninth look Tobar but I'll tell you what I'm not blind to his lead I come from a county ... which is a border county with north of art and\nIn my constituency now all of the counties along the border with northern are and they're the people I represent I drive to go through the north of artist so it's my it's my territory if you like\nBe their lives there and I lived and know what has happened and I think that's the part of the discussion that people aren't hearing\nAnd you have to obviously respect different views on that but\nAt some point when when language is used like I say she had not blood red lines out some today for example I read that I wouldn't even say it on television for quite a vulgar comment about this I thought were going to fire here and that's like comments required but also understanding that the u._k. is leaving the EU breaking\nSucking up so much energy from the European Union and they knew everybody and they're making a statement to say they're a much bigger dangerous and challenges facing that you and for you as a\nAs an official with with a sort of overview as vice president of the European and I don't know fish on the phone different that's\nFair enough you'll rule was vice president European Parliament how worried are you by the fact that in the midst of all this fuss about ... what we don't seem to be focused on is that certain countries in the like Poland and Hungary legs are simply refusing to play by the EU rules and except\nBasic and your values when it comes to things like a free media and independence of the judiciary\nAnd I think we all should be worried about that of course we're all concerned about and that's why I voted that there should be a ... view of what's going on in hospital seven ...\nSeven doesn't work because not only a poet and hungry for themselves but they are acting with the support of a block of countries that have articles which would allow them to be disciplined by the EU commission and the ISI Jay and others it my what\nI Know but I Wish I'd met picked or been face to face and I said to him my concern about what's going on in his contract at so be under no illusion that ... that is a big issue where also dealing with those other other fundamentalists I'd wanna portions they at least within the European Union you have the capacity to influence and\nTo bring out to go seven which you say is not going to work\nWell they shouldn't have to respect you say we are dealing with it under article ... article ... was triggered last year and Portland this year the polls have pressed on with these judicial changes which have been voted the president basically getting rid of molten God on the judges and the older you protest about it the more the poll say we don't\nCare yeah when you're in a different job than I Am my job is to make sure that the polish leadership understands that the root of a half to ... even if that takes longer than I Would like that we keep\nDemanding high standards and the the benefits of Europe is that at least these countries are with us around the table but it doesn't take away your core point there are deep\nDivision and what not on the other division and it also seems to me that the the the the strain of nativism nationalist populist politicians which would include those in governing in Poland and Hungary are\nMaking the political weather and policies like yours in the center right that is going to Gail in the white block in Europe the European people's party\nThey are running ... of these people your own blog refused\nTo expel victim opens the days even do you think he is flashing European value but first\nOf all I'm not running scared if I knew from the country but I'm pretty brave and my politics secondly the bushes conservatives did not vote to function Mr about not hungry so there's a question for them\nPlus what's happening within the ... group are deep conversations above what is happening with the orb on I've I bought him and told him what ...\nWhat can we learn how to put ... we\nWe have said very charity our views of it as as has ... the leader of our group who also voted to fashion hungry we have not yet and go to that point it may come where we say we cannot be together but don't come place uh know traumatic action with inactivity there's a huge amount of active\nOh so you say but what a number\nSo I say with respect so I Know because I'm involved in\nThe truth is you have governments across east Europe who refused to accept the\nNotion of burden sharing when it comes to taking from his office immigrants on a whole host of other issues including the creation of a new security fools putting ten thousand gone into from Texas east Europeans won't buy it so all of these issues when it comes to health issue of migration the notion of collective you action should know happening\nNot yes but the pressure would have to be in that direction\nBecause for one simple fact the biggest driver of migration flows would not be conflicts but it would be time to change and Europe needs to do more on that the reason why is a

Arab uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power veterans\nWere working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now and then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be\nAnd what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies and you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in ... that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you know the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London\nOr Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe\nYou worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board there is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft\nAnd the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play\nWe took about taxes I think of a taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think it's a nice traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have perhaps allow regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people five to ten times a year and we all find ourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting in and I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic passing\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi\nYou're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\n... botch over there to go arrow hair on business day from the BBC\nThat really for the new tech will be when these flying drones but come\nOn just a novelty play thing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people that you will meet well some Seventy or eighty stock sums up battling to develop the hard way and ride sharing tech them ...\n... is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve pivot says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job and galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things in simply finding places in big busy cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America what was going to start somewhere else about the regulatory hurdles and less Hi\nYeah I think ... probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and uh it just a natural fit you know a lot of islands to John\n\nWell companies are from the
