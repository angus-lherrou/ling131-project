results it's one of the world's first and leading perspective space mine is\nThe last decade we've seen tremendous progress not just in the topic and environment around space mining but in the development of outer space in general\nWe now have rockets that we can reuse we've been to all the planets in the solar system we're finding moons in other solar systems we've landed on comments brought back samples from asteroids rode around on their services\nAnd I think the big shift is we are passing a tipping point where there is more private money\nBeing invested in space exploration and development than public money the public money certainly paved the way as it as almost always does and with those points of inside the exploration back from the first first explorer so to speak\nOr we can see the advantages see the opportunities and really start the industrialization of space and expanding human society to to new places\nWhat are you going to mind for MySpace money standpoint we are today focused on this\nYou don't have to bring them with you and as in all things and transportation you don't want heavy baggage you don't want to be paying for shipping very expensive heavy things you want to bring his little with you as possible and get all those things onsite\nAge to a who's who may one right water or ice in the form of with what you find on asteroids that was the first talk it used to be about\nYeah water is very likely the catalyst to opening up the space age for for you and I water can in the form of age to hydrogen and oxygen be split and made into rocket fuel it's the field and rockets right on right now so the ability to take that rocket that guy from the surface of the earth to earth orbit\nAnd top it off and take it farther a mixed that supply chain a lot easier and a scalable to like\nHolidays that we can't even imagine millions of people living and working in space instead of a half dozen\nI can get the idea 'cause there'll be a potential sit at a station in space for a gas station in space for these bussing spaceships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term surely because\nWe talked about economics rockets the now going up and down from a fall cheaper than they used to run I mean the cost of fuel as a proportion of\nAn ... SpaceX rocket kind of shoot him spaces is actually only a tiny fraction of the cost of the overall mission so he's he's few really good deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the earth just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never has to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be nice and he let me permanently in space and it'll it'll be that shuttled that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd sometimes you'll feel that shuttled from the surface of the earth but maybe when that shuttle gets out two GS secrets were bitter farther out from the moon you'll feel that with a resources from asteroids\nAnd you're going to need to call them the first I mean or at least in an active sort of industry on a a population of that or or some kind of infrastructure before you can even begin to start arguing for the benefits of space mining\nWell this is what is the challenge and the business of space is the chicken and the egg yeah what is the series of stepping stones that that is sustainable you get this going so you have to like you said make the economics of it\nIt so happens that these economics are kind of the economics of large industrial projects uh their multibillion dollar projects\nDecades in length but a similarly speaking they have the opportunity for hundreds of billions of not trillions of dollars in revenue and value creation and it's it's kind of thinking about we make computer so cheap probably never going to make money on computers and of course there's not a part of our lives that are not touched by computers today\nSo a space is kind of a an an the next version of that quick\nQuestion if you you go you've got your asteroid and you'll sites and you go up and you land on it to prospect and you come back and go yes it's got all of the things we want to lose more besides but it hasn't gone by that and there's going to be back for several\nDecades or that is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining\nWe see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons so with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it weren't easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nIt's happening now how soon are you going to have a ... starting to prospect on that particular restaurant the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding\nThe commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nBut five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources and do you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale my\nChristmas here on business daily from the BBC\nLiving we discuss space tourists space factories mining even automated space refuse

that level but of course if the investigation confirms the media reports that it does put the relationship into a severe unprecedented crisis\nMount Lemmon a correspondent speaking to me line from Istanbul well let's look at another close relationship between the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nIt's predicated not just on business deals primarily and on sales but also as a key ally in the ... region as we head and Bob replace houses report there is also the two countries shed interest in keeping Iran in check\nIn recent days we know that us pressure on the Saudis has increased the significant phone calls have been made to crown prince Mohammed bin ... by the president's son in law Jared Kushner\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo on the national security adviser John Bolton\nThat speak now to enroll in American Middle East expert and author of a book called Saudi Inc the Arabian kingdoms tissues just profit and power welcome to to news out at ... calling for is what you think is it the halls of the relationship between Washington and re at\nOf the relationship right now in there so it gets Egypt\nBeing a powerful force in the region that counters Iran but also there are deep economic ties and a lot of those ties though are one sided at this point Saudi Arabia has a lot of investments in the United states and is very close to the United states economically\nBut that being said the relationship is much more important\nFor Saudi Arabia than it is the United states to for example the Saudis have paid their currency the real out to the dollar uh the Saudis are actually the largest importer of are in the world uh they buy a lot of that the United states but that doesn't make them\nThe most important is\nA purchaser of arms in the United states of course American defense contractors sell more to the U.S army than they do to Saudi Arabia but these these ties are these economic tie a are very important force Saudi Arabia there are a lot of Saudi students studying\nThe United states and many of those students are scholarships that the Saudi Government pays for\nOkay well we know that Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country and the wealth comes from the oil industry so want in in in the context of the world I mean how how much can\nSaudi economy influence the U.S economy\nSo if you want to put the Saudi economy into kind of a global context Saudi Arabia is a ... country but it's really more of the border it's nowhere near as large in our county as Canada or\nThe United states or Germany for example so I'm Wiley is influential in that it is up there a lot of that\nEconomic wealth does come from the sale of oil it doesn't really have a very large non oil\nGDP now it's working to try to change that\nBut those changes are slow and so right now it's\nIt's in Flint is mainly in oil up it doesn't have the same kind of influence that it used to us in Nineteen Seventy three when it's control over over oil was able to say\nCripple a America's economy and and European economies right now that's not the way or the oil market books today there are lots of other sources of oil hotel it is very influential it's not the most important\nAnd when we look at the way in which over the last eight days the United states has shifted its position on come out openly to talk about um it's ... about the ... case\nThe president has so foreign to use a couple of options and his two books private diplomacy and public statements what else can use\nFinally they're they're bunch of of other things that they could do 'em there are\nUm the United states could stand at the sale of\nArms to Saudi Arabia and I know that is an option that some ... Congress men and centers seem to be interested in pursuing so there's definitely that those kind of sales I Believe need a some sort of a government you know official um confirmation order to to go through a but there\nAre also a lot of Saudi um businesses in the United states for example the Saudi oil company aramco owns the largest ah oil refinery in the United states and the United states could\nPotentially I'm not saying they will do this but they could potentially say you know we're not going to accept any more oil from you\nAre and ... that was I Would then start to lose money and and have to use oil from from elsewhere or they could even potentially a either threatened to not allow Saudi Aramco to own that oil refinery if they deem it a matter of national security okay so there's definitely that they can take\nWill leave at that mold on American\nThe Reagan kingdoms tissues a profit and power or she was joining us live from Jacksonville, Florida you're listening\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.
