I asked the question that everyone is wanting to know is ... century online now pointless and reproductive times can we get rid of the men and just rely on when he was talking about [laughter] yeah so\nI think um one really important point to remember that this is that it took really extensive amounts of genetic modification in order to create this mass um and it was still very using the some of the most cutting each team next year\nI'm Still really inefficient crises\nFor a dash where at least eight people are concerned that at the moment many of them fishermen and that was one of the big

many heeded that warning some didn't and unfortunately it's cost them their life\nIs there a sense of the authorities weren't prepared enough food to people fill them enough was done maybe but it's just unfortunate that the storm was too strong\nLook I think that's a contrast between the two weeks in Indian state so we had five Irish side of the euro casualty policy\nAnd they evacuated three hundred thousand people and while the huge damage with trees falling down communications for in many parts of the state and the huge risk of flooding now with heavy rains lashing the area\nI spoke to a senior official last night and he was happy he said because nobody had died and now if you contrast that to I'm Glad for that I think question has to be asked that\nAbout the efficiency of the planning because eight people have died we knew the hurricane was coming we know that nature has comes with such a force but I think more of a debate and under for that show about whether the authority should have been doing more to ensure that no fisherman were asked to see\nHow big of a toss because we're going to be now to write some of the rooms get rid of the problems of the destruction of the storm was closed\n... past um you know the heavy rain is going to cause a lot of problems with the potential of flooding in many different avenues remember this is a rural economy

looking off\nDo these go to charity we raised many in the Monday saying they are saving these girls from sanctioned exploitation giving them an education\nMultiple girls pulled apart but if you solve with the prices go dark thing on the first day\nGoing forward but that also reflection of the fact that in Liberia badly the resources are are often so low\nThat if someone is able to access to resources like Milo was able to whether it's through quicker than campaign accomplishment are left are like the more traditional bonus I think that when someone is able to accept the money and provide

did that and this was a very wide ranging law that still has effect today\nUm and we've made many impacts actually over the years a as a news organization\nAnd ah that that's actually one of the most gratifying things um because it's so Graham a subject and so difficult to cover\nUm but when you can actually bring awareness and bring a bring change to something that needs change and needs awareness um it it's very gratifying I think for all of us and and that's why we do this\nAnd in your time reporting on this story as it is that one ... personal story that starts out to\nMean there are so many um it's it's I mean they kind of wash over you and and it's just a heartbreak but but I guess I'm just as a mom I have two children and\nAnd the crisis affecting a babies who are born a

stops on the b._b._c. World Service this weekend [noise]\nLiberia now what questions are being honest about how an American run charity set up to provide an education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused instead\nThe more than me educational charity was founded by an American woman Kay she might she raised millions of dollars I was even given building for free for her when I was ... by then Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nBy two thousand fourteen three is offering launched a number of girls came forward ... they had been raped by organizations main coordinator Macintosh jumps and he\nWent to prison and they died of aids to the fact that the child he was able to operate ... funds despite the scandal and get many people who might be well one man who took up the story in a year long investigation is in young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by public uh time magazine\nSo this is an organization that war but we step up by American ponder um market it's basically the girl the sexual exploitation but in the background her counterpart been made not on the ground was exploiting many of the girls and then what we were looking into it was like well what happened to the Gulf dealt with by widespread was what happened then when I can post Johnson died\nIn twenty sixty ... what were the circumstances of the death of what was the implications\nNow Macintosh that used to be called these the the men involved the ... the man who's actually exploited and abused these young women he was a Liberian himself\nAnd he was one of the

authority but yourself with the cool thing on the first day going forward but that also reflection of the fact that in Liberia badly the resources are are often low\nBut if someone is able to access to resources like Milo was able to weather through quicker than in a competition or ... or traditional bonus I think that when someone is able to accept the money and provide services there can be an issue to well OK it might not be perfect but maybe it's the best we're going to get\nYou see the question some male ... well why would they still allowed to operate by the government when this whole

this must be brave enough to testify\nThat that she regretted testifying because you've been told by the organization but she did everything would be fine by me and she felt she was little\nI think the key thing to remember and all of this is that there was probably about ... about the ... more than the resources to West Point that weren't coming otherwise they wouldn't organization that we stepped up to help some of the food with a little bit with all those who struggle devote so even those who perhaps felt they were treated badly there there were white or there was a fear that well\nMy story by telling my story I could lose what was what looked like and given by this organization that I Do it all comes up is going to step up\nAnd that in the news you can find behind the film called um detecting released by public at time magazine and a and the organization has actually issued responds happened\nYeah they say they moved to me just to support children with safety health education

to apply to sanction on at least the Saudi officials responsible for the fact drew some it was originally designed to go after\nRussian officials on human rights abuses so at this point I think there is mounting pressure and Washington to punish the Saturday at the same time it looks like President Trump for now it's sort of getting a pause on them\nAnd we should be clear to say that at the moment is just intelligence that said that it seems more than likely that the Saudis responsible ... days no definite proof that yeah\nThere is the Washington Post says the U.S intelligence community believes that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and knew about this operation unclear whether it was intended to be somebody like this and it could have been a basically an adoption gone awry which is bad enough but yes it's looking very serious at this point\nSo the question now what can be done what kind of ... if any if Congress hoping that President Trump can bring to bank ... hum so easy to tell you that we still support\nWell I don't think that we're going to see anything that dramatic I think that there is some sort of sort of naming certain Saudi officials are of Arab on making a very difficult for them to travel and own things abroad at least in Europe so that's one possibility\nAt this point the basics of the U.S Saudi relationship whether the U.S all back away from the Saudi war

to do the things that you could send a team of Fifteen people into another country\nFind out about it so in that respect it was a blunder as well as a crime and I think that the Saudis have to understand that the United states is the most powerful member of the U.S out of your life and there are certain rules you can't cross in that respect\nAnd really the big point here is that you you don't want the Saudis to act the way that we expect the Russians the Iranians are the north Koreans down we want this outage me sort of in in this general space of course there on the U.S side when it

movement takes energy and the phone today it's a ... full full feels like oil and gas\nEarlier this week fans governmental panel on climate change came out with its latest report and we'll be hearing from one of the office and it might have been\nEssentially the report said we can't go on like that and if we do what gangs in danger the stabilize the fly that cities cars and buses and everything else around me it's going to need to be powered by renewable\nBut he's not possible what's that going to do to the economy and can we have the kind of ... we've got used to oh well we have to get used to something else maybe something less dynamic him what does that mean that politics can lead it this way down to make\nThe sacrifice that well there is a pretty tough questions that but that's get back to the theater now me sat paddle\nAnd a tunnel is ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University ... he's the policy director at the Grantham instituted climate change at the London School of economics\nJulius Steinbeck I he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to amend the of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to and she's one more pests than a nuts you read ... he's one of the authors of this week's PCC reports and he's with me here in Studio ...\nYou read the report calls for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to come at a price\nIs the well on track to teach anything like that target festival to clarify the report doesn't call for anything\nHave asked the IPC in two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear that two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and now this report\nClearly shows that there is a important difference between warming off one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into ways in which global warming can be limited to that level\nI suggested ... is the well on track to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to ... it's not on track currently the pledges of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereas in mission should be decreasing very very steeply a by twenty thirty\nSaid painted the picture wall saw the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs I've two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive also for for the rest of your ecosystems there is a redo your shift in the impacts\nOn forests and other systems and find the also for humans the difference between one point five and to a degree of warming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by heat waves\nSay already sent stock consequences coming out that a roadmap pollen ask do you try and make the changes that are needed to bring the temperatures down what sort of things does the report suggest might be necessary\nThey're actually putting things and you know five flying is one of the most environmentally damaging DVDs one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that to people especially so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon I'm American by nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards and the life of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city centers so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flights\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality the laws they don't spend as much time sitting and congestion worrying about pollution we can design a will there's both lowering our missions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the bud and will be some jokes that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be loosing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand five to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term clause doesn't equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra seat practicing that you can't another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLewis says what do we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term losses but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is\nThe role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other is simple we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better off so I think\nThere's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short\nTerm ... cases I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise DC isn't elements of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real\nReal things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questioned some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the terms of ... we're seeing massive increase in the months of renewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar\nReducing our carbon emissions and so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable finance area we can say the\nOil financial products ... pension ... has to be aligned with at one point five powers to get for example I can see that now in the elements no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they mentioned the will to these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou know it was just want to us to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one really should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual project wants\nTo just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question was going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already recon observing today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd read to degree of forming business ... in the far future this is um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for ducked\nDown to route and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to be carefully managing managed to adopt the shield the poor of the impacts of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare law where he wants to come back and\nYeah I think I wanted to bring together to that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see like when you both and thanks to all these work over the past\nThree years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he says making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance there's a great you know but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section\nBut I think what do we have to realize there's been um scholars and partly because high is working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had\nIs domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications on countries send patients they're beginning to be competitive\nSo it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough\nAh as they obviously the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made all center report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not hurt it's not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about culture's important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent parts when he says you're down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period\nIn the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double ...\nSo where do we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next\nForty years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities the dock congested polluted unpleasant places the bay not\nProductive for we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that thought I Want to wrap up this how fast now thank you to our panel throughout the as an adult ...

and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make could Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations is level but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the fed can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\nMyron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't is not lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believed defiance and they use the science to argue for the fact of use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think fat\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have that particular view on the science what they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\n... wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that trait how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it seemed to be cheaper to generate power from other forces\nBoth but he's in the points the facts of becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nAnd disease appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them forward or it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because of sea level rise is a good chance the warmer than average wolf is in the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change and United States nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress in the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to see her all at the route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nIn low carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies\nAre are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the festival the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo joy to I Want to talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nFast but also the country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly serious he just described with some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it sort of\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda is much more to talk about renewables but at the same time let me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a shortcut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not linked fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus will do\nAnd doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments of all give that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate change and this\nIt shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat it Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five I signed the developing countries are doing the milk must take action cyst\nNo it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps in the north\nTried to convince off ancient funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels or the investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea of shifting the problem is that right and so I Do developing country should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic destruction do you think\nFor a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\n[noise] the problem with democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if you can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow soft him as in the mountains and\nSo after consequences if you just try to look at the agricultural sector in India the coastal sect in India they will really suffer and there's a ... for a reason to dig dad use into account and try to read visit our energy storyline Judy assigned\nBook a so there's a big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons for China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not democratic\nChina's been going for sort of both and strategy of growing all energy times at once but I think\nAny kind of well run the country any kind of country that has a government that cares about his population will in fact be pushed by that population if that population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nAnd in a few years we won't be in the same place we are now will be much much worse off

that\nIs along the way as he tries to persuade Kim Jong un to give up his nuclear weapons are correspondence Laura Becca to the interview while\nWhen it comes to his knowledge of war president moon is the son of North Korean refugees so one of the first questions I asked him was was this more personal and political for him\nAnd he said that he does understand the pain of war the separation of war I you know as I said his parents like North Korea Nineteen fifty three they never sell their family again and he said one of the reasons why he wants to be president of South Korea was to help prevent war returning to the peninsula\nAnd for those who lifted all boats Advil knew that the the fighting here on the Korean Peninsula ended in Nineteen fifty she was an armistice never\nA peace treaty and now both north and South Korea would like to see some kind of end of war declaration and so that they can work towards the peace treaty but to do that they need to not the United states\nAnd the U.S is unwilling to do so until North Korea makes real concrete steps to disarm and give away their nuclear weapons that came out in the middle here to try to mediate between at the U.S and North Korea has been at president Moon Jae in\nAnd he has had three summit with Kim Jong un this year and he says that Kim Jong un is connected to complete denuclearization and that he understands that that means

Catholics and stick approach with North Korea yes they are quite and\nSupport or they certainly support the United states approach current United States reports of maximum pressure they've been finding out for that but in the past they have to kind of more carrot and stick approach is so incentives to North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and he may be looking for president main certainly has it seems to be traveling to Europe with the hope\nThat European leaders can help him mediate between the United states and North Korea to find the allies in his path towards peace I think that's one of the reasons and that he's heading to Europe and the next week\nAnd how is he being judged so far by the people of South Korea\nThe overwhelming factor has been his relationship with North Korea and has a developing a piece of member he came to to power last year\nAnd just as the war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong un were at their worst I mean this time last year at North Korea had tired I should stick successful nuclear test on those ... threatened\nTo resign fire and fury in Pyongyang and many feared for the Korean Peninsula was once again on the brink of war so he has been seen as somebody who has been pushing for peace in his poll numbers do go up after\nAny summit with Kim Jong un domestically he does have a bit of a problem because people here are worried about unemployment rates I mean amongst young people for instance itself at ten percent\nUsed it from the b._b._c. on them because you can come to shop for this particular better now but questions are being asked about how an American Ron Charles you sit up to provide education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused as Ted\nYeah then more than me educational channels he was founded by an American women kitchen miner who raised millions of dollars and it was even gone into a building or by the then president and John ... says lease by twenty fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and matching they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison and later died of aids but the fact that the charged you will still able to operate unreasonable funds despite the scandal and good people in Liberia now one month to up the story in a year long investigation on his name is simply\nYoung he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by ProPublica and time magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier who was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the grind selecting girls often managing scholarship program\nBut sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students\nAccording to their statements that police had\nBeen raped by the co founder\nHow old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... began on ten girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal charts talking\nTo you know how many girls will actually raped as a number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh on\nOne of the interesting things about it is that there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in care or so when the rates came to light the organization essentially said that this was a community issue\nAccording to our investigation to minimize the role of the man who had been a central ... who died an intimate relationship with the founder they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him and then they simply said well this is a Liberian cultural problem\nAnd as Asians own operating cultures and a challenge in context may have contributed to his ability to access and abused young girl their mind ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died it it's\nSo it's possible that these girls would be raped will actually infected as well\nThe challenge with the story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named lessons victim spots indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's a there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continues to operate just generally there'll be many changes at all to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place it's definitely true that the organization sought\nTo to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented a whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually there it's been reported in which time two girls were the first time according to their statements that the police so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the rates came to light the organization ended up really rising international prominence in six months afterwards because of course the bowl a brick\nHit

I think developing countries\nSometimes the attitudes that are held by the rest of the world is that they are not able to\nFully accept or see someone even from a rural part of an African country or just anyone from that part of the world as a fully hole and complex human being\nThis is an assault chi chi chi chi in New York based Nigerian American doctor he just public awareness lack in Nigeria [noise] she told me that's been ... eating disorders in the country and public awareness is live\nThe response that you may get from the general public from some people they might say I don't understand what is going on what do you mean you don't want to eat\nThere are people that actually don't have food to eat and you're saying that there is food available but you just don't want to eat they don't really want to acknowledge that there are some components of a mental health issue\nWhy is that why is that is typically around mental health\nYour demons somewhat of a pariah from the rest of society some people will say\nAny abnormal or strange behavior that they may know or dean strange our normal\nIs basically spiritually induced all you need us prayer all you need is\nSome sort of spiritual intervention or cleansing so not many people really want to talk about it and not many people really are able to get the amount of help that they really need when they are facing any kind of mental health issue\nAnd how are you telling you about the lack of resources to people in Nigeria suffering with eating disorders\nI'm extremely worried I feel that sometimes it takes\nBefore somebody actually takes a problem seriously and at that point it may just be too late [noise]\nA quick reminder you're listening to the food chain on the BBC wild ... with me and then he told us this week I'm hearing about the experiences that couldn't have had eating disorders and why the prevailing stereotype that many white west and went and he says that is so harmful\nI've just been sneaking ... she adults say he's being explaining how some aspects of Nigerian couch and might make people vulnerable to eating disorders I wondered whether someone have suffered from the on this which agreed with having out of this\nSo I spent ten ten to ... to ... block I he suffered from ... from the age of eleven\nNiger as a society where um he pulled aren't refrain from commenting on other people's bodies\nUm even with little children um especially with all girls aren't exempt from these kinds of invasive comments about their bodies um and you got them not just from the appearance but you also get them from adults\nEspecially from grown men and um it made me very uncomfortable thing would they say men would say things like um you know you ... which is like basically you're developing a bomb\nAnd then also women they would say things like covered this or your bum is too much or you're developing breath and like they'd actually be totally pincher bomb\nThey gave you the impression that your body was in surfing itself into the public view and then it was your juicy to to hide it\nAnd then not just stop but then they transmit very vicious comments about people's weight as well so if you're ... your cold or a ball and if you're a sin like they call you won't go fish and like they make all sorts of like horrible comments about you [noise] um so that was really where like the eating disorder starts it\nAnd we'll say anything else going on for you at that time that may make you ... do you think\nSo several times um you know I had a um some situations where\nEither I have to physically get away from someone who was trying to assault me or there was a lot of inappropriate um behavior towards me by older men or older boys I'm so that\nKind of compounded this idea in my mind that my body was a problem and it needed to be controlled because clearly it was attracting all these harmful people towards me\nAnd I think that a lot of um young Nigerian girls and like probably even boys go through the same thing because there isn't very much record for people who you know had been molested and it's usually in the new age without the broader on themselves\nI'm so because of that people really learn to self censor in a way and one of the things that you can do is like you know to shrink yourself into to make yourself less visible and one of the ways of doing that is to start starving herself\nBut Motown told me they can be hot today in a Nigerian family\nThere's too many people in the average Nigerian household who can observe that you're not eating and who can report and like that will be dealt with the media can be so I Would eat and then later on I Would throw it up\nNot on a cat ... a closely guarded secret people wouldn't have understood she tells me eating disorders in Nigeria and be seen as frivolous\nThe average white woman\nSo even one block people have eating disorders it's seen as well will be fought so many other problems\nThat require our attention our money we don't really have time for this but we don't really have the resources to address this\nThat's why it's being asked or the white woman's problem because I think the insinuation as well white people have the resources to address like a problem a trivial us having an eating disorder are there any signs that things are changing\nThree of them ended up the public's radio dot org

G inside that comes to that building\nWealth David if if the reports are true and there's a lot of coming out of turkey this morning as you've seen 'em this would be murder it'd be murder by the government of Saudi Arabia against one of its citizens\nMr ... is also a permanent resident of the United states of the state of Virginia He's a columnist for one of our most prominent newspapers the Washington Post\nSo from an American perspective there's a direct interest of the United states government in trying to pressure the Saudi Government to tell the truth of what happened that denials by the Saudi ambassador to the United states cannot be belief at this point\nAnd the Saudi Government has not offered any convincing evidence as to what happened\nAnd so I think that pressure from all world leaders including from the Turkish president has to continue on the Saudi Government\nIs it your reading of what you've seen and Donald Trump or as it is one has tweeted about it and a secular state Pompeo is talked about it too is it your reading of these reactions from Washington that the U.S government is indeed applying pressure that you talk about\nLet's return Nick burns if we made to NBS himself and it is important again to think from Washington's point of view that for a long time indeed the years that you were very senior figure in the state department there was deep concern\nAbout the degree to which Saudi Arabia was exporting or a ... hobby religious ideology which was\nEncouraging dangerous extremism and many other parts of the world where Saudi resources were being invested in mosques and ma dresses and what have you\nOn NBS addressed all of this and he said to Bloomberg just a few months ago he said look we are trying to get rid of extremism and terrorism without a civil war in our country without stopping the country from growing\nAnd with continuous progress in all elements and he actually said with regard to human rights if there was a small price to pay\nIn that area it's better than ... paying a very big dent to make that move now\nSurely in Washington there is still residual sympathy with that sentiment\nWell you know the Saudis have always had a great deal of support in Washington because the Saudis have been in the vanguard of trying to contain Iranian power that's been a priority for the United states going back to the late Nineteen Seventy to the Iranian Revolution\nThe Saudis more recently under mama been Solomon have grown quite close to Israel the Saudis don't say that openly but Israel now enjoys the best relationship political foreign policy intelligence that they've ever had and so you've seen the\nSubstantial changes under Mohammed bin Salman but at the same time Steven I think that there's growing impatience and now outright anger in both of our political parties in Washington and inside the Trump Administration over what appears to be an entirely reckless inhumane\nBe steel act by the Saudi Government to kill one of his own critics you couple that with the the problem with the Saudis have caused and the ... by prosecuting this ill considered very violent war against civilians in Yemen with American weapons I think in the United states we're on the verge of a major debate\nI hit the Saudis can't develop a convincing narrative of what happened to Mr ... show he I think both political parties will be in rebellion against the Saudis you'll see criticism you've not seen before you may even see an end to the American arms provisions to the Saudis on Yemen which are like would be the right move\nAre interesting you say that I was just looking this morning at the figures in the last year the American\nArms exports to Saudi Arabia where some Eighteen billion dollars\nSaudi Arabia I think takes more arms and votes of any other country in the world from the United states it represents twenty percent of all us ... balls and sixty percent of Saudi arms imports that relationship\nIs so important to both sides that I Am skeptical as to whether your belief\nThat the Congress for example is now going to ask them really difficult questions of Saudi Arabia is really going to happen\nWell you know we're not going to end our relationship the United states with the Saudi Government because there is so much riding on the containment Iran but I Do think two things may happen\nSee if this sorted drama continues if there are no answers from Riyadh that are convincing unprecedented criticism by the United states against the Saudi authorities number one and I cannot be that's going to be a problem for Obama than solving\nBecause as you know uh there's a lot of controversy within Saudi Arabia bought his rule about whether or not he's actually strengthening a Saturday influence around

I've been up the ... the head of the national guard in Saudi Arabia he had a military base and security officials in the country\nYes absolutely and and the national guard was in charge of protecting their oil household and the oil installations\nBut if I may have been ten men it's secure in his position he wouldn't really result to these kinds of erratic acts the war in Yemen it's been going on for over for like four years and we have seen no end to the bombing using west and a ministry equipment\nAnd also expect tease let's not forget that are people from the United states and from the ministry in Britain on the ground in Saudi Arabia and we have heard that without us and you can support this war in Yemen would not continue for\nMore than ... because the Saudi Government continues to frame that war in the wind the context of a struggle within the region within the middle east between Saudi Arabia and its allies and the Iranians\nA framework which frankly games a lot of traction in Washington and otherwise why they continue to be able to prosecute this war what\nI'm fortunate today is that as Saudi Arabia is seen as the shield against Iraq in fact at Iran yes it has intervened in Arab countries it hasn't been shown that ground it has supported the growth and Lebanon in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere\nBut the argument that we can tolerate it at a press in regime that has actually gone out of its way to kidnap prime minister like the prime minister of Lebanon and puts him under house arrest forced him to resign to destabilize yet another country in the middle east\nAnd for us if it that's probably another immigration and ... and a few crisis to go that far without actually they us than Maine protector of the Saudi monarchy putting as certain conditions on it's on equivocal unconditional support is unbelievable\nThe strategic importance of Saudi Arabia if we look at it on one level today we see a young Roula let's call them the ruler of the country I'm be actors just thirty three years old he controls\nPretty much all leave us a power as far as we can tell and Saudi Arabia remains a virus the wealthy oil rich nation which masses ... many other\nTo the the strategic balance in the middle east it is very hard to imagine the United states wants to see old prompt instability in Saudi Arabia\nThe last thing the United states would want to see and I think the rest of the world certainly the Arab world will be instability in Saudi Arabia Steve I think we're looking at\nAlmost a Shakespearian drama here\nYou can see the promise of reform\nAnd the acts of reform or by the Saudi crown prince that will take Saudi Arabia forward and then you see a dark side you see the paranoia you see the sense of vengeance you see this unbelievable violence inside the country and the rest of Saudi citizens and the exile of other studies\nAnd and it's really unclear how this is all going to turn out which way well this young man turned\nBut certainly the show he event if it's true that he was murdered um this is going to be a watershed moment inside Saudi Arabia and for those of us those countries around the world that have close relations with the kingdom\nYou've been hoping for some sort of change in Saudi Arabia for a long time do you see this is a watershed\nMoment not under the leadership of ...

brought on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people left behind those responsible was\nPunished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's in it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that\nNobody is behaving well anyway\nAnd then very specifically and perhaps why this particular\nStory consenting Donald Trump has had this little impact as it has there is a loss of trust in ... and ... on preparedness to believe actual\nEmpirical facts lots of that's possibly does come from the rise of social

huge investigation is more trusted\nThan anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience that the time didn't he wasn't even brothers collapsed essentially that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the tea\nYes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis two blocks away from the ... it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a lot of money just landed in my fifty by your cat because I just sold in apartments in London\nI went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in ... deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible\nProtect seats by the governments and Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people and smart suits trying to shovel and money around to protect it now that looked like a bank run technically it wasn't they weren't actually taking money out to the right but it looks like a bank run\nAnd if we hit strides publicizing

the anger vis\nErodes the opinion against them as your least false one five to one against very powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nSo people saw it as you withholding crucial information that they should have had access to if you being in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media so she's like the F T where I was at the time of the new science acting as a responsible so sick of being your reliable source that you can go to for information is as if they took his points I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taking a furniture and it would have been out there on social media ... now regarded as the norm as a baseline of acceptable behavior\nJust not just the two thousand ... financial crisis it is also social media that is created this lack of trust and\nPrecisely there was a loss of belief in the financial establishment combined with the loss of belief in conventional media these days information gathering is tribal people read the information they're interested in them to\nRead from sources they don't care about and when you put the two together what you find is that if a great\nAnd wonderful traditional news source does a great piece of investigative reporting it can still cheerfully be dismissed because there is a sense that everything's through the financial world is corrupt anyway and you don't need to trust traditional means you have to tell you things it\nKind of makes you wonder what would it take to budge someone's opinion on President Trump I mean if something as big as a serious allegation in a big global Iraqi might need to stay in New York Times saying a sitting president is effectively\nA tax cheats not the implication of the newspaper whatever denials era\nIf that makes no impact what would\nI find it very hard to imagine that somebody made the famous comments about shooting somebody and Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him he was kind of right now yes it's hard to see\nWhat's which change opinion at this moment and given that opinion is so polarized and people derive their information\nFrom particular associates I remember I sense out of the tweets Donald Trump is delighted to tell everybody how wonderfully stock market performances so I sent that street simply comparing how he had done compared to ... and ... it's a done veteran drawn from renting them under Trump\nAnd I go to a bunch of replies say where did you get that from was that from MSNBC which\nIs the most liberal cable news channel\nHere and see an sorry yes yes so you can\nSend that basic straightforward factual information about how much a stock markets as reasons and it will still be treated is I bet you go that's from somebody liberal\nBecause there is so much talk about post factual ... but it also suggested other sort of near and\nYes it's very difficult to talk about this in\nTrust trust is very difficult societies functions very difficult for finance for folks and there was a lack of preparedness to believe anything that you don't really believe will to trust others to work in all of U.S interests it's very dangerous\nJohn ... of Bloomberg of course the real test for President Trump will come in November when the U.S holds midterm elections but while there'd be no immediate political repercussions since the New York times published its allegations against him earlier this month\nThe New York state tax department has because of it is looking into the claims and New York city officials have said they've joined the investigation to that the ... is a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush\nThe big issue is this is a state and local level investigation and the president has no power to pardon at state and local level it's the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan prosecutor her going after the Trump entities in New York and at that level he cannot do anything\nSo if he really is facing a serious investigation there he's going to need cash\nAnd so that's why I think there's a very good chance that he won't run again because what he really needs and wants to do is to launch what they're calling T. N. N. which has the Trump produce network to take on C. N. N. and I wonder you know is this why he's meeting with Kanye and you can see him beginning has set the stage as it were\nAnd he's going to say look I Won the prize I did everything that I needed to do feed that done then there done that and\nI might have a much bigger more huge platform as he says which I think he'll be right about because actually having that kind of a media platform will be more powerful than the White House where he has genuine constraints\nBut if he's doing his own news network and that's what's in the pipeline for him I mean if Fox News is on his side he's got a\nLot of it you know he'll do everything from reality t._v. too political talk shows and it will be outrageous as you can imagine but I think the key thing is the world of journalism is paying so much attention to the Mueller investigation which is actually yielded relatively little\nOr no attention to the state and local investigations which are much more serious threats New York state penitentiary is not a joke I mean is it or not white collar presence so that threat is a very real thing\nAnd as you say these are state investigation wreck he has no say of a state if it was a federal investigation apart and ... is a federal investigation left in a way he needs to worry less about that and worry more about the tax investigate\nOh I think that ... that is right and I think it's also very interesting one of the things that Brett Kavanaugh had specialized in was the fact that the president can pardon\nAlmost anything at the federal level and now he's on the Supreme Court okay so now we know this is the situation but state\nAs a whole different thing\nTo the ... the Trump news network I stick with a dependable BBC but then I Would say that for me and today's producer Lawrence nice business daily is back again at the same time [noise] [noise]\nDa ... of Providence the public's radio dot org it's nine o'clock [noise]\n\nWell continues out from the BBC well said this unrest in a while the president of South Korea named Jay and speak to the BBC about the talks to accelerate denuclearization on the Korean and it's\nYou know what North Korean thing that if they receive currency down in the end they there is no reason for them to cling on to nuclear weapons\nWill affect the composition from the perspective of the two Koreas and the United states technically officials are reporting to possess recordings they say shows the Saudi generalists ... was mad at me as a nation in its time boom will talk to Mr ... editor of the Washington Post\nAnd the F is for me too movement and made a splash in Hollywood Hollywood is in the midst of its own me to crisis we have a report from Mumbai\nI hadn't really offer all these years but they got him when we offer come our making to affect my high profile racing and I would say that are here to not ... less than ...

have to figure head and so when she quit it made a big impression but she kept quiet until now she's broken that Saddam in this interview\nAnd she made clear that she felt she had no choice but to

that she revealed to me this interview that we were caught in Trump's how's that she'd been subject to what she described as disrespectful comments and behavior by very senior members of wild
