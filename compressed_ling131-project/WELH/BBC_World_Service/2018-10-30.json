you as a right to ...\nI think they're always taboos and particularly an odd ... mother agreeing that taboos but I think is dangerous octaves risky\nThe one that's in in a lot of conversation now in terms of writing is the idea of cultural appropriation who's allowed to tell what the story and I mentioned that because while I don't have any rules about what I can and can't do as an artist\nI I'm sensitive to watch a few of offensive to me and as a writer living in South Africa who came here in Nineteen Ninety two I Am South African you know I I'm a citizen of this country\nBut I'm a particular kind of citizen and so I find that there's such stories I approach with and I haven't learned how to tell them yet for a lot of my main characters are a bit like me\nAnd clever on I mean the age that has always been political in South Africa that all of that any to be a huge today\nI think at the moment there's a real risk you know which used to having such a a history of protests and

think at the moment there's a real risk of self censorship so I've just been very aware of where the opportunity to live and feeling pressured to avoid certain narratives and just because those

that come about as a result of like social consensus\nAnd usually they're there to like ... and then sometimes it's a good thing when we don't feel comfortable joking about it and things like the impact of gender based violence of things like homophobia are so huge\nThat we can't even risk to try to minimize those issues because you give a green light to people who would act out that bigotry in ways that tend to be harmed people\nSo I think that it's necessary for us particularly in disciplines where maybe we're making lights at the comedy for example but in film navigating the taboo would look at the difference I think people navigate taboos in ways that show where we stand as a society about those issues labs thank you so much [noise]\nWhere are we going next over here are
