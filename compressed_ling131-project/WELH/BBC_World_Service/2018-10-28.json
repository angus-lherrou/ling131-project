Kentucky usa [noise]\nOver the past six weeks the b._b._c. is for the following us this recovery what are the most serious problems America faces today the opioid epidemic\nWhile you're about to hear as are journalists following this story as it unfolds\nIs not in women from children's hospital\nIt's friday to fourteenth of September [noise]\nI'm Laura hunger investigative reporter with the Courier Journal I'm working on a story about babies who are born withdrawing from drugs\nMy name is dawn forums and I am I ... I take care of sick babies that are and the ICU um after they are born to them you know I see [noise]\n\nNewborn babies are not born addicted that is a common misnomer but addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple\nFacets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies their infants that were exposed to a substance in utero\nThat exposure if long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that substance once they are born and they no longer have that substance being provided\nThey become at risk of going through withdrawal and what sorts of um withdrawal symptoms debate so babies have the same withdrawal symptoms as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI system so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms though they breathe fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kitten here which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their well being so babies are in console of oil and crying that is babies don't handle that you and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for\nHours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick babies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crime\nThey sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of weeks\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down up stay the same certainly as I say I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly increase anyway we've had at seven hundred percent increase in substance affected infants in the past decade\nIn Kentucky or national nationally and at the trends in Kentucky are probably leading that fact\nAnd she's one we go today\nShe had some problem she breathed in some of the fluid when she was coming out and she had flood on her lungs so she had to come up here to the NICU before she showed in the withdrawal symptoms and then when she was up here she did start to show symptoms [noise]\nShe's had diarrhea off and on and um she as she tremors which you know look like she's having cold chills sometimes increase muscle tone so she defends up a lot and her so can the rooting she um [noise]\nSucks a lot more than other children would [noise] I mean it's really hard because you think you know I I did this to her I mean they say that you can't get clean for anyone else it has to be for yourself\nBut there's there are so\nWe're going to the funding rooms [laughter]\nIt's a room that we use as a a meeting room and also a room\nTo get away from everything and a clear head yeah it was a meeting with them a group of teenagers to talk about drugs and how drugs have [noise] um affected their lives\nWill use it for research

orange walls and uh the furniture\nAll right so I think everybody is here I'm so well just kind of start by I'm fucking a little bit about what we're doing my name is Laura hunger we have been

like they don't really go into ups and do it they just tell you the basic stuff that you need to know [noise] like yeah like common sense dislike\nSchool I think they care more about other stuff than drugs they rather stop the own stupid things like you got to just go you know in his round instead of whether you have something on the show I used to\nHe's not going to say but if you've got your shirt off the that's the one that going to get outside and so were there\nWhen I'm In ... as long as people that are that I noticed smoke when teachers asking those the the little was questions or\nOr

possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and the lack of government control of key parts of your territory like Bruce Lee ... everything that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that in came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the Afghan people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end DSS\nUh I think they did a tremendous need a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those\nThree or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle bravery for one second but he is the reality your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country\nDidn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar and the guy's name a that was no voting because of security concerns of course there may be some more voting next week we're not quite sure we know that your own in\nA transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy's a plus the dozens killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling stations one has to conclude\nThat off the Seventeen years off post Taliban governance the government in Afghanistan is still not delivering for its people\nI issued a statement our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies and ... that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful of mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people\nAre in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives 'cause he said this he said the NATO exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life\nUnknown gains because our country is not secure\nHe says that of nights I was ... and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life\nEither from nighttime forces off from your own Afghan forces unfold waltz because this is all you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Africans we don't\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government um they have their own opinion\nWhat I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news a space for them on a son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is that transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm I Am a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along the way they know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yeah that's way out of the war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves\nIt's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a ... it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures everyday and thanks to reason with support who are being helping and equipment and training our security\nOf security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe ... we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing the U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formerly the head of Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our allies with fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan and why is that on my ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time we told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the piece in reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where where\nDo you allow us because we have millions yeah I I don't think it'll stay straight down said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports it's sources saying quote\nFills that I had these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban\nJust uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly ... them and Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one consideration for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not set in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador you didn't know he is very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't ask to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan\nGovernment always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nYou you cannot um have one incident uh dictate an entire policy\nAnd that's not what the American stands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor its success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process why on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite that threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place and Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and can tendency he wet weather the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in a in a democratic process and let the Afghan people choose\nHandler my we have to end it there but I Do thank you very much for joining me on TALK\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

found for example if you don't use a plastic bottle then you'll have to use a glass bottle how much energy goes into the use of that glass bottle how much energy goes into either recycling into just throw you in the landfill one has to consider what the alternative is for each use of a single use plastic\nI thought the whole point was that they were single use plastics and a glass buffalo you can take back to shop and refill and using many times as you want to tell them I mean that is the perceived wisdom surely\nWell not necessarily I haven't seen many return of a bottles in the United states at about twenty five years whether a lot modem in Europe I can tell you well that's fine they're also costs money to scrape those bottles up and use them again it's not that single use plastics should be used\nIt's not that getting rid of them isn't a good thing but you have to be careful about being sweeping\nI'm just curious as to what the alternative to sweet thing is I mean if if you introduced legislation to ban single use plastic says you don't have the ... doesn't did a good thing or is it no it's in your opinion\nI don't think it's a good thing to have a sweeping ban\nShould such measures be expended so that it becomes written into global trade deals that well as\nIn not just been a European Union then it's certainly not good for the world I Would like to see fewer single use plastics out there right now what's your life and your plastic forks or are going into restaurants and being handed Styrofoam cups and things of this nature\nHowever one wants has to be judicious about this and think it through you have to be careful about how you go about this because you might end up using more energy rather than less it depends on the energy use of the alternative that's the problem\nRight then you decide to just you know blindly thrower regulation on you know something this is a good example of why it's ...\nIt's just kind of I'm thinking man eight out of Brussels better sports people to vote the way they do\nBut surely it boils down to whether it's best to to use reusable items again and again or to use plastic options if the science shows that you all damaging the environment less by not using plastic full surely there isn't much of a debate about it unless you represent the interests of plastic folk make 'cause\nI don't represent anyone's interest by the way I guess I've said over and over again to you that getting rid of most single use plastics probably makes pretty good sense\nBut getting rid of all I don't know and that's what bothers me about this legislation because they may be circumstances which the alternative material actually causes more harm the environment because in\nIn the nature of the way you use [noise] pizza mogul Ritchie who's an economist and business professor at the union but University of Maryland in the U.S what did you make of that Chitra\n[laughter] I understand what he's saying about having to look at

plastic is not new\nAnd we've seen plastic bags being banned on the African continent for example in Rwanda Kenya march ... and Morocco and of course across the world ... taxes on plastic bags\nUm [noise] I think it's a very welcomed development my flights um reservation is around the bottom plastic strollers in particular\nAnd I've been reading the concessions from disability rights can campaign has about this\nAnd who took about how many people with disabilities need plastics jaws um in order to be able to drink liquids and how to use metal ones or\nPay well I well actually other materials such as paper and metal a glass of silicon don't necessarily what\nSo many people can be allergic to them they can cause injury and that can be a choking hazards metal for example is not safe for hot liquids and pay per head dissolves with repeat to use and so I Do I Do have some concerns around the ... plastic strollers\nUm but by and large I think it's a beyond that it's it's a welcome development and I also like to look not just that single use plastic but other kinds of plastic that's in the oceans as well so I was really struck by the high proportion\nOf plastic in in the oceans that's due to fishing I think twenty seven percent of the ... on a beach is from that and and I'd like to look at that as well as um clean up as well as prevention\nMatthew I Know this is an issue close to your heart's it's a civil liberties issue I think is is ... that boils down to the Peter Morici and view that people should be free to the environment that they want [noise] what\nWell quite an I guess every time we come from the supermarket Laden with a huge part of plastic packaging ... making our own contribution to that site I think for those of us who are\nExtremely concerned about this issue it's actually very refreshing to hear\nA political the politicians are an on any political institutions in Europe taking strong action on this um but there's things sort of a ground breaking it will will quite yeah it is it's it's a directive at this age is not yet lure of course but hopefully it will lead to legislation which will force\nIndustry to change 'em but there's also

I'll get dismayed marked eventually okay chew who said that the b._b._c. told the BBC the government should think about tackling corruption first rather than trying to get fewer people to have fewer children\nI think the best time to talk about population is when you have gotten their ride with the economy the truth of the matter is that corruption has ravaged every aspect of our life in Niger if you have not been able to fight corruption where one two or three people can stick enough of them enough money\nAnd money that can feed on ... on Sunday out of the country if you have ... in Iraq with the economy if you have not done anything with the resources that we have\nTo prove to the people that they should come um Israeli doom where how can you blame population you blend population only wind up all those things are in place when corruption has been reduced the barest minimum when the ... and the rights hands and techno cross professional hardly the Colombian doing the right thing\nPeople believe that when you have a child it's a lesson from the lord people believe that when you don't have a child it's a curse some people even go to the porch off by reversing their wives sending them away just because they're not able to bet you regret\nFor me is you give me a job to do I would target demand for care our target demanded the ... the ... and who always want to make this happen in the mental where it's on in there with the best thing to do is the target the men and that's why I was talking about a grassroots movement\nOne view from your native Nigeria Chitra what's your view on\nWell first of all I think we need to be careful and\nAbout language so the story was initially reported as and be as putting in place population control measures\nWith some reports even saying that the government was hunting limits couples to having two children from what I understand this was a missed reporting and actually what the Nigerian government is talking about is\nChild facing and family planning other than that so I think a lot of the ... actually comes from the the initial missed reporting um\nIt is supposed to be the greenest thing you can do not to have children isn't it\nI completely agree but I also agree that this is\nThe responsibility of individuals to make 'em it's that that right to decide when and how to have children and this is also women's rights issue as well and the person who just spoke talked about and needing to talk it men I think that this particular idea\nThat's the public's radio dot O.

scene what\nJames Brown would have thought of today's world in which sects machines were actually available to buy it's anyone's guess you see the link or he might have been intrigued by the fact that sex robots Brussels\nHave popped up in some cities on this subject it's fair to say that science fiction films haven't inspired optimism from the Nineteen seventies the step for wives where I'm bishops women are transformed into do style husband pleasing automate\nAnd more recently the British movie ... which are female robots stabbed so the city is create to the city is having use that word for a while to death so\nRobots are going profoundly to change our lives and all sorts of ways but how will they affect all sexual behavior\nChildren after the room perhaps and slides health warning Kate Devlin is a senior lecturer in digital humanities at London universities King's College and she has the answer to everything you've ever wanted to know about sex row boats but were afraid to ask a new book\nIs called toned on science sects and robots and she joins us in\nThe studio welcome tight and morning are quite positive about sex robots aren't you\nWell in a way I mean I think there is potential for technology to help us with relationships to help us with intimacy on to bring pleasure to people but whether or not comes in the form of the currents extra boats is another story what's on the cover insects robots there's really no to any\nReading it we kind of have one in prototype that's jus to ship to customers that any time now I really and it's essentially a sex told her love till\nI'm with an animatronic hats\nUh how'd you hear from them that why is it so different from a blow up love a wouldn't say blow up because they think they're quite expensive um they ... up with a [laughter]\nIt's probably up with a little too much too early ... dies of dollars up words to buy one of these robots um five thousand dollars up words if you just wanted adult version they're made out of silicone\nThey are um sculpted they are they are kind of think it works of art and but they don't look anything like humans rate\nOkay we're going to dispel a few minutes in a moment what do you make of the concept ... very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nWell I find it really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a essence\nRice effects robots kind of feel Kate and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily does we know that sex toys for example have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of the ... is a humanoid form that's that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body\n[noise] and and that's the problem why are we talking just about the female body flex robots for women on the sex robots for gay women\nKnow that we're not yet there are not yet at this at a male version of a sex or will it tends to be\nIt doesn't ... because on most sex toys still does which suggests that the the classic lead on would be a you know deal do based sex ...\nSo essentially there's something else here and I think there's two streams what the two lines of development one is the sex toy like you say there's this big things like Elizabeth I breeders around for years on the other is the sex to all the sexual has always been a fairly new market for men\nOkay entitlement and some men in in sexual to ... you know this is an area that brings huge alarm bells\nUm the compliance ever willing female figure is in policy isn't it in the form of the passive sects do which takes what he's given to it it it it's offensive to many people on all sorts of levels\nAbsolutely I Am not something we'd be fat by ... fight on the air is as well and of course which always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman gets about ... and uh the female robots or takes over it as a threat to the mountains I think there's a certain power levels is with real life than not fear\nUm but yes it is it's just this past the female form that we have and I I ... maybe the wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of\nHelping relationships so in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew I'm kinda nervous the venture into this month we'll we'll have to admit poor when I saw that this was going to be a topic of discussion it\nJust before I let you in the morning but K I really don't shy away you know I've I've merged my by my has raised ... became ... can you tell us how you go into this topic what what drew you to this you know I wanted to ask that question out it was to route\n[laughter] well I mean it's a fascinating subject area um it came about rainy from a sitting up in a pub after conference will come to the systems talking with a group of colleagues say what is it a bite develop have symptoms that can think why or why why why would feel this effort into creating\nA ice that half human like traits we have very specific traits that changed the way we think and sexuality is one of those it affects how we how we ... [noise]\nIt's kind of fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes ...\n[noise] yes I mean we've touched on this slightly already but I wanted it ... I Want to explore more and we don't want to read about one sex robots would mean for human sexuality particularly given that as we mentioned already designed by men woman suspended straight man\nWhat are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes of an agency consent and lights\nAnd and also a link to that is not a perfect analogy but when you look at pornography\nThere a particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put fluids in pornography as well and I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I slept Yale ideas Kate\nThat's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a male straight while I'm ...\nI'm a last word has her normative so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on monogamous and I'm featured in this case um it's it's a month and a woman and it's it's a sex evils of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today all tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and they all tend to be white as well um whether they aren't where there there are it's all the different skin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized um this is probably my take on and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these things\nTechnological stage of development where robots can really accurately imitate a ... you know stop the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots which so the problem is how sexy can they possibly be wow ... ... it's quite a bit ... and I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time\nBut we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these the I mean surely the technology is changing so quickly this also official intelligence is hyper realistic veal I mean the ... or at least I can talk to you convincing not somebody they so they these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] this robot\nThese robots have personalities that are being developed you can carry around just starting to look up on your phone tablets you can have a virtual girlfriend and your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic and convincing the human than any rowboat\nWhat's being reception fuel bookcase oh sorry Chitra quick point realize you're going to\nSay just you know he makes me I'm wonder why people need but she'll go frames\nAnd weather is is this does it say something about who got boyfriends and girlfriends that I mean let's be honest it's not boyfriends at Central Gulf and is that we're talking about and does it say something about masculinity\nI'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll girlfriend who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and thought\nBecause I Know I'm ... yeah I think that's there's probably about it and I think ... sort of the talks looking at the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers us so we of course you know we're able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps men have more problems\nWith a K Devlin author of turned on south science sex on robots many thanks for coming on the program big thanks to August ...
