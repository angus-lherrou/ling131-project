on this actually I just it trying to explain to lift as walked at coral ... he's a\nYes or well morning and thank you for having me and Carl nurseries are\nA tool basically for restoration efforts to produce more corals and nurseries are coral nurseries are just like a plant nursery but instead of having a greenhouse nurseries are located in the ocean and about ten to five meters deep\nAnd the nurseries are places where we've installed what's known as the coral tree and the core restoration foundation is actually one of the pioneers in this methodology\nAnd it's basically this PVC and\nFiberglass structure and that how does call fragments suspended from its branches trees allow for corals to grow with\nThree hundred and sixty degrees of access to light and nutrients safe from credit and segmentation\nSo it allows us to grow a math quantity of corals and a relatively small area it's\nNamed genius idea when was this thought chef and who thought about it\nSo our nation was founded by a man named ... and and the idea just\nWe've been operating for a little bit over a decade now and and we start in implementing the trees and about two thousand eleven mhm um they've now been kinda widely accepted by restoration groups as being the leading a sort of a best practice for restoration efforts\nRight so um does that mean that coral reefs can make a comeback because you'll ... you'll reap such a basic thing you just recounting coral a brunch is right [noise]\nRight it's very basic but it's also very tough job [laughter] it's not easy that's for sure and write so weak or these corals and about six to nine months to actually move them to a reef site and attach them um directly ... in a process known as out planting\nAnd restoration it's not\nIt's not going to replace a recall that was ever lost the situation our coral reefs are facing right now or rather\nIs rather dire and so we understand that we're past the tipping point um however it's widely accepted that without active intervention then these core populations um will likely not be able to persist on their own\nThey'll do some Florida is basically the wealth that law just a Barrier Reef and and you know the plants and animals in it but obviously a lot of that reef is vanishing fall said these corals ... will help reestablish that correct\nRight so the corals that we grow our the apparently was a threat and on their tutored species that and we're trying to plant a corals an extreme abundance in high diversity to help sleep promote resilience on coral reefs are along the far to retract so hopefully they'll have some resilience says they face these continued stressors\nAnd and that's something that I use sharing these reefs with any of the policy of the world for example because if it's if it's a sort of a success story in friday's eventually this idea should be sold to other countries\n[noise] absolutely we work with a lot of international partners um there's also numerous restoration groups in South Florida throughout the Caribbean and at a global scale a lot of them have adapted\nTo cold treated methodology um we're very much about trying to share lessons learned what

it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just ask what was your breakfast I usually ask my patients do they have you eaten unit\nBecause she sometimes for gets herself she has ten kids and she had been even eat and you know the ... she's feeling maybe she was just to serve in more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your clinic when a female patient walks in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to I think that\nFor my last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change it because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality said you know family planning this is what we should do and we push our patient as the\nPaternalistic way of telling what to do what's right and one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came severely a leading in flood level was very extreme you didn't know and the condition and somebody we don't have blood bank\nSo we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact died of blood and and draw divide so we struggled after you know six seven hours looking at ... and ...\n... you cannot have the children you have to wait you have to do this given all this patient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again bleeding okay so she had another miscarriage yet and I was so you guys you know starting breaching hairy you know you want to die you ought to do this\nAnd by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or for the children I just to get my second husband if I don't give him a child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen and shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to just say for our children\nFrom that day on I just my views become more broader I started listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from it's not only being efficient who or training to what that time for my clinical skill is and where\nI went to come back to some of the other cases and challenges you faced take all the first ones off skew point about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and this is a cause for non because most treatments were designed for men and women went inside\nWell science has really been based on a very male model and that goes down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the sex of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle and that's the reality of women\nSo much of our science has been done on a male model and even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women and late face clinical trials\nYou're still dealing with the issue of\nThe science on which the clinical trials with spaced being based on a male model\nAnd can you give us an example of a disease that affects the chief ... different she\nSure let me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see and cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries and the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference\nSo if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises do we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked there are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology\nWomen are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to develop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something this actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg\nBut the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow they are you working in ... a country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority one of the greatest Barry is chief ... treatment for the woman in you\nIs there because when you're done ... where you don't have lost to follow you know the\nBrutality happening to the woman his body and all the way the mid to late the way they don't allow him in ... surgeries\nBecause the man said so or because of their is declined to fish and so if you're a woman and you married from one client and you born from other so you become an object of the\nRivalry between the two clients and they will not allow you to go your own house procedures to the woman or sick to buy this can ...\nDefinitely they affected in many levels\nBut if things not improved with the new government [noise] not\nYet the whole health system is run by World Health organization the government is very poor did enough money to invest in healthcare\nStill everything you focus in its among tuition and infection where we're neglecting their diabetes and chronic diseases so it's still difficult it's still hard and one thing that\nThe health care was improved for the last\nCouple years it's a family planning program and schools charge spacing so that's the one area we got progress and we educate much mother said we'd give the injection we have delivered all hospitals the\nInjection is and and birth control bill so we're pushing on that site and I'm very proud to have does\nPoint to teasing translate you research into each into biology how do you translate that when you're working in the type of environment that day covers describing\nYou're really thinking about whether or not only the disorders that diseases that affect women\nBut also what is the context of that disease\nSo for example if we were to start to think about lung disease in certain areas for example in Africa and other\nPlaces one of the main causes of pulmonary disease pneumonia but also chronic pulmonary disease or cook stoves you see what the end result is but how do

this river cafe so this is Ron from the basement of a hole in the basement of hospitals really that's interesting and it's and it's the right open space I wasn't expecting it to be quite this spacious and welcoming and I've got to do with me she's one of the co founders\nI Know so far and I was actually I yes ah why did you feel there was a need for repair cafe in Bangalore because we in in in Holland we would think that's in India people would still have repair skills\nAre we mistaken\nThe the need for the cafes and because this generation is bad is getting lost the ... living in I'm\nA new leaf and uh uh via not seeing a A R people that are betting that owned us so that ... that is it needs to bring this concept again yard\nDebate is there isn't a gene for the genes of sleeping and I do that same you need to make it if you need to open it up I'll make it\nAll got loads of repair business as an engineer anyway [noise]\nThere are many the bishops said this although this is also the pick of the bed there's a big market nearby it's at all in the corner\nHow'd you get away from harming most other businesses you say you're taking a long have you been away from us [noise]\nSo in this affect you have potential to better also sitting along with us along with wall India's a so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than not taking their business over the\nFiscal year ... points ahead what we find is obviously politicians of it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people and all that kind of the day they can't afford to take something along to a professional repair uh\nI'm ... assessed tends to be told to calm the retired so what we do is we do at least the assessment for free\nAnd then maybe we said we're taking it to retire so we take out some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC company time have those games\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair should become cheaper\nAnd now for many people repaired professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor and labor is sex tiny\nSo we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor she'll be tax lower so that's a professional repairs have become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd um [noise]\nI I don't know of course there will be different on labor costs in different pulses of wealth or\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet\nAfter listening to have\nOne thing I Want to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work a dose of course we're alone people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just\nTo a landfill thought the other day have listened to this white what becomes of\nToday and I'm checking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThrow this will be told and share this broke yeah yeah he found that and take a break at the yeah I mean you say totally broken beyond repair all well I don't know if he's a so frightened ... holes in the ... so that he's not what I mean I Wonder what someone could replace the metro POWs [noise]\nThey might be able to taste and buy from even ... that just I just think it's just easier to get rid of that so they may they might have been ... is it is it the time as well during the time gas fun yeah I've got two kids that have to run and I just started writing sometimes it's just not practical exactly [noise]\nWhat's in it for the camera stuff from cameras stuff you know when you put a hold of links and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately um towards the point where they come used because they got fungus in general things wrong with him so that due to the bottom could you ...\nYou could try that but it's not really much point they're not willing to take it to patients clean around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good that the ultimate equipment it's just that\nIt comes down to the fact that that's worth in perfect working older about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that and sort of ... was a real hair it ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour legs and we're going to put them in the well this is the full applause has been no I've already been up here and how to look and here\nWe should really be doing things to reuse things but it comes down to ... county is designed she's a she proceeded um than you can hardly find people buying the right to stuff especially if the new equipment is going to be generally cheaper than able to quit and he does a better job [noise]\nSo there are a couple of issues to raise the I Wonder if in a bona people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but not often gets in the way they're too busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously people loves pretty busy that day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around\nWho are very conscious about did and vitamins that that same values we get in some parts beget vague will just phones because people want to do their bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things they had actually doing a lot of their thoughts so that things don't go to lunch in\nMost you know I Wonder if you could kind of address ... some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe\nYou would kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because they're already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people how did you ... the other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip you acquire averages throws the ...\nWell that's the challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack I say\nWhen they have something that they really want to hang on to win when it's a precious broken object that cannot be so easily replaced by the cheap you time [noise] and we know that that's what happens when people come to the ... say they don't really expect things to be recast but when\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nTowards a more sustainable society\nPolitical running short time now ... cafe in Holland is still still carrying the people that are fixing the machine the pull their policy chapter launched Sean and get him into the workings of the ... some final thoughts and from everybody ... mancino ways to solve it can\nI think that will be more repack I faced because they'll they'll they'll be needed but we also hope that the manufacturers realize that product should be the parable and that they should be a produced in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired in a proper way\nMaybe you might have a three D. prints are in in ... so you can principles back home to to fix the things that you don't have the will stretch away\nThat movie challenging but um maybe in the future\nYou love that Christmas you Oh yes I mean I think the future of preparing cafes his much around bringing people together\nAnd I think coming to RIMPAC cafe yeah it does create that sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships slows people down for a little bit ... actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider roads applied and simply connecting broken I comes with Paris hits hits hits connecting people with each other\n\nBut thanks for everyone to have not seen a ... person to Chris in London and Chevy ... in Bangalore\nThank you for this thing too well tax if you want to see ... cafe in action and making a video from ... it'll be there soon will actually back next week for most patients from around the world but for now I'm all\nFor most a class and how to repair and electronic say this but it's a I Know I'm going to ...

I mean a very divisive issue for many people something for the people who feel strongly about it as he even just talk right now\nPerhaps be even more divisive could how would you go into that I mean again it would put you at all with a large subset presumably of your customers\nWell that's right I think it might put the adults with the subset of them I mean ultimately a rule was said to them look at the end of the day this is your decision it's a democracy that's what it's all about you decide what do I know but I think it's democracies at stake under very important\nIssues for ... for freedom the economy liberty and so on I think it's right that business people speak out the public isn't stupid you know just cause I make the case for leave doesn't mean they they'll agree with me\nIs there any sign that it's a positive and I\nKnow which I think it's a good sign for democracy\nI'd be investors response to you making the stand and and and making it public and making it a part of your public experience\nWill investors or people of the highest principals as you'll be aware and share price goes up they'll stick with what you're saying I think\nI hardly hurt anything for many investors there were one or two but a very small minority who complained that I think probably they were complaining 'cause they were remain or rather than the feeling that would damage the business itself\nIn supporting Colin Kaepernick uh people started burning Nike shoes recently no one was burning with a spoon spin that so they\nWere probably some people who are a bit cross but no it wasn't the most loyal as the burning of shoes that's for sure if I Know ... ... ...

in a private lives so for us there's a huge buying on those issues it's not marketing thing\nOkay so this is all just heartfelt stuff it's not anything to do your saying with the commercial end of the business know how's it affected the commercial end of the business\nWe just have to rule when he first started campaigning publicly that we would never on judge a campaign by its sales figures that we would never look to chew up at the same time because he would make you hesitate to do and again so that little fact and we largely stick to it as\nEverybody else you right now how is it affects your say oh I can\nTell you they don't want to because actually surprisingly it puts sales op\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was getting all the negative publicity\nYes yes during the spike up campaign and yet it wasn't our campaigns people it was actually our accounts people came to us and may defend called and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know and hang on in that\nBecause not because of any news is good news\nI think it's cause any news is good news out I Would

like Nike and you and what you'll do would you like to see other companies doing more this activist campaigning and as part of the brand promotion\nI'd like to see companies take a look at the world
