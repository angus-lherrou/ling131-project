for joining us before we begin I Want to ... one more passing and nuts Yuri ... he's one of the office of this week's IPC the reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep rising global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to comment to price\nIs the well on track to teach anything like that target festival\nWent to clarify the report doesn't call for anything the report also is a question that the governments have asked the hype if you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on people's cleared up two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warming to one point five and noticed report clearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeans into raising rich\nGlobal warming can be limited to that level\nAnd so just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rule is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereas in mission should be decreasing very very deeply by twenty thirty\nSo paint a picture of ... the consequences of temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it it's still possible that some of them survive also for for ... ecosystems there is a redo your shift in the impacts\nOn forests and other systems and finally also for humans the difference between one point five and two degrees of warming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by hatred\nSay already since dark consequences coming out that a roadmap power enough do you try and make the changes that are needed to bring temperatures down what sorts of things does the report suggest might be necessary\nSaw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do\nYou show that to people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable life how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible sign them on American my nationality right now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now\nA billboard so it's important to people on the ... the talk on climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards and the life of deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker a more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly\nBecause you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are often outside the city centers so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term flight\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have better quality ... they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is both lowering our missions and one in which people's living standards Ohio\nLaw which is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jobs that since the end\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be loosing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten thousand people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however short time\nI'll say I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing an extra see the price of thing that you cannot another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people said larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLew says what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate for these short term losses but who's going to pay for that as well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies\nI Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a harder time however we the appropriate policies of training we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors that we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better\nOff so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get\nThese short term ... cases I can just bring you back for another year he was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I looked\nTo sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the transition wishing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effective ... greens working on European policy so you know for example I work from the sustainable\nFinance area we can say the ... financial products or pension products have to be aligned with one point five Paris target for example I can see that now and the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they mentioned the world that these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it just went to work to do that when asking the question who is going to pay to\nFor this one really should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one does this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question we're going to\nPay for it for just once we can predict one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd read to degree are forming business ... in the far future does this um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees ... about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about what was going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to carefully managing managed to adopt the ... the poor of the impacts of this or that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare law\nWants to come back and yeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and then I Do or you just made a lot has been done we have a Ninety nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries we it's auctions fifty eight countries or\nTo all of these work over the past three\nYears or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly cities is making it easier there isn't to label called them price for instance there's a great you know but I Do is that what do we need\nAnd I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to\nRealize that there's been um scholars and partly because high and working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so\nIt's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough as they say the report is reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made all the report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not hurt it's\nNot just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but it's also necessary for political reasons I guess only in that situation do you get to support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the global economy is not stuffing and there are three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty says to him down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two\nThousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety shortly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at a ... rates of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next four years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not\nProductive for we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy role of of um the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap

to you know I Would say that's what makes it an issue is the respect for the sources not the junior senator from proud of\nOur stories are not the end of the conversation at the beginning let's think about the context for things and these conversations are they connected\nSo when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was becomes touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC reports\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more ... serious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the say can you imagine anything that the soldiers could say that would be swayed the administration but it needs to take this seriously\nFault no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron ... talking to the BBC's Evan Davis so they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular to us\nIsn't this the last I think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office of the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and they've used the science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for a week or\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\n... wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government her signed up to\nSee how but how do you decide your date and of course that tree howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states as shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheap to generate power from other ... shots shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the points the facts of becoming separates it from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs is\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida is just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is pick up because it's sea level rise and there's a good chance that the warmer than average waters in the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies\nAre are actually something that uh brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the ah swelled the very developed well let's see if we may ... to ... that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... the he's a professor of environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us\nIndia because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing fast but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly seriously just described with some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then if\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about\nRenewables but at the same time let me just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a shortcut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not going fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happens studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional look in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that it's a good reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this\nCome back to the politics because then the cost Indian governments of argue that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate change\nAnd therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beaded Nineteen Ninety to two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action cyst\nNot it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's\nIt's no longer a viable argument to say they're going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways\nTo bypass the mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could ... tried to convince a bench and funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those fossil fuels\nOr the investments to the south and I think that's a very good idea to shifting the problem is that right and so I don't even developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels they should try to bypass that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic destruction do you think for a\nCountry like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\n[noise] the problem with democracy is a force is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other\nHand I think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow soft them as in the mountains\nAnd so I've consequences if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the postal sex to in India\nThey will really suffer and this is for a reason to dig dad views into account and try to read visit our energy storyline in Chile assigned book a so there's a big reasons for India to make\nChanges do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not democratic\nChina's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time spent months but I think\nAny kind of well run country any kind of country that has a government that cares about his population will in fact be pushed by that population effect population as well informed enough about the risks that are coming down the line and are very near future\nAnd in a few years we won't be in the same place we are now will be much much worse off in terms of the impacts we've committed into the system if that if that awareness is spread and\nThe public's radio\nAt four hours you're G welcome to the newsroom from the

borders being attacked\n... you know there's there's it's quite common to have community mistrust and then they voted on break it's very scary virus a wet people there's a lot of people dying to oversee people that are very scared\nBut I think you know the specifics city with this outbreak is that it's happening happening in an area where there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension or in in the community\nUh you know just last week Eighteen people last month sorry ... people were killed in an attack by ... group on in Benny this week four people were killed in an attack on the city as well and so people are very uh very scattered and angry and there's been a lot of protest\nActually being venue at the moment ah against rising insecurity and as a result of that it's making the response is very difficult and I'm I I'm being told that every day at the moment\nWow is either because it shoots hang around the city ... tried to cast and this is ... their response or the tracing the contacts that people who could raschke I\nIt's it's making vaccination I practiced law and order and making the burials ... and that is really a key parts of the year better response ah because at the guy that virus that is that is very contagious\nI ... on on someone who has died intended burials is ready I keep prompted the response from this is why they'd installed the new security measures wet at least ... all the data bull at full burial teams if needed\nLouis divest correspondents in the capital of the the ... thank you for making time for us on the program this morning Joe ... is with me in the studio here in London Jonathan you will not particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how we usually this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nOn of course there's lots of a local coach or an an on local uh practices that involve quite close contacts with a dead body and so\nIn past um outbreaks Hussein that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial to get not body buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that\nIf you can't get access to the communities are of course the other elements as well as as a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building and unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected you isolate them and then you monitor the concepts of those people and if any of them becoming cited you isolate them and by just doing this\nIsolation ... or ... monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control because you can't do that if it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nAnd the coolest wet actually there is distrust of modern medicine absolutely\nOn this huge mistrust and again we ... we had some movies that there's a very effective vaccine which really well in the in the twenty fifth outbreak in guinea which is really what it was a given its first opportunity\nA and this is a very effective vaccine in these sorts of outbreak conditions but again you needs to be able to get into the communities you need to have them willing to be vaccinated so this is an incredibly challenging time\nThe world Health Organization is saying it may be another three or four months before this latest outbreak is brought under control just how bad could things get in that timeframe\nThe worry is that there are cases which is a a cropping up in in very disparate parts of the the region so so the moment the outbreak comes around two hundred square kilometers and I'm not saying the whole of the areas got about her infections but there are little so sigh of outbreaks\nAnd of course if you spread your resources every great geographical area it becomes incredibly challenging trying to do something about it so whether it's two months three months or even longer who knows at the moment\nThis question the one last one is ... this is a disease which so far has been largely can find to places like that the ... seat but the the war is a way that it's going to somehow get on a plane and then be spread around the world how big a risk is that briefly\nThere's there is a a risk that it can be taken to to other countries as we saw in the twin cities you know break but then is unlikely to spread too much unless those places haven't got great health infrastructure\nJonathan we'll come back to you during the course of the program the says we can from the BBC well subsidized five forty five GMT the release of the latest un report\nAnd on some key aspects of a lifestyle for example are you prepared to give

way off track on targets and we're heading towards the rise of three degrees Celsius it says we need to make unprecedented changes to the way we live our lives and dramatically reduce\nOur use of coal and such changes will inevitably cost trillions of dollars between now and the twenty thirty five so is there any if this\nRealistic to discuss this we brought together hallowed macaca former prime minister of New Zealand to the former head of the United nations development program and detach hell I'm professor of energy policy at new college ...\nIt's one of those moments of truth I mean if you look what's happening globally we are miles from the project power that the I PCC recommend\nAnd we're a long way from the kind of measures they have in mind so we have but in China nearly one thousand gigawatts of cold now ...\nThey're building two hundred and fifty new power stations in China and this voting two hundred coal plants outside China as part of that development programmers and they're growing at about six or seven percent per on them which means China will be as an economy twice its current size\nWithin the space of about ten twelve years so we got India China and Africa old growing six seven percent or we go coal maintaining its role in the international stage and we've got the oil companies projecting the old mom will go on up\nI think it's going to be very very tough because it colds full unprecedented action by countries and we're not seeing unprecedented section at this point\nReally we're going to need the most incredible political will and heavy lifting to get the policy setting some place\nTo change what at the moment is not looking at one point five ... two degrees future but something much much worse with with catastrophic implications when I was prime minister I was aware of\nPolling evidence said do you think the government should do something about climate change to nearly everybody says yes yes they should\nAnd then when you say well you prepared to pay more for your picture all to do something about well nowhere near as many people say they should do that so it requires very bold leadership\nI think it's to the credit of the ISI seat to push out this kind of science based report about what has to be a little bit careful about how it's done so one of the great illusions that those who like myself I Want to do a great deal about climate change\nI've been guilty of propagating is telling the public that you know you can have the greatest transformation from my almost overwhelmingly fossil fuel based world economy\nTo one that's based on renewables et cetera within the space of the few to ... do you know what it isn't going to cost you anything in fact it's going to the economic growth and Hans ...\nNow I don't think any practical votes or believes that\nAnd all the evidence is is a housing clock correctly said\nThat when the public to confirm to be paying for this and they've been told that he wasn't going to cost much they tend to react negatively and ended up ... world how you get the population of China ... white the Chinese leadership\nNatural on the Republican support base in America the change Mr Trump's mind that these are really quite take off and the truth is China\nThere is very significant climate change unless we can find a white sweating the Chinese leadership do otherwise\nAnd I think we should also heed the woods of next to the way he said you either pine now to make the transition or you get a pie immensely more light to that for the adaptation to the catastrophe what we really need this transformational leaders who are prepared to tell the public that they can't get almost layoff in\nOne respect I'm extremely optimistic that the pessimism is about the top down kind of global agreements the optimism comes from the transformation that technology is if you want to think for around the ... century for serious optimism\nThat day will come when it's cheap to produce

a big difference though there are some persons at the beginning to was told a nationalistic stuff but they were just a little men minority but now that I read that the majority and they asked to absolutely power in the ISP\nSo why was the policies that you found it so attractive to well I hate to use the word but racist\nI think wall um the cause of the demand that the euro or should be

criticize the Holocaust memorial in Berlin a from a pet tree you work closely with rocket petri said the migrants should be turned away with firearms if necessary\nFor time I was in the position that I had to defend those positions and the longer I stayed in the ... the ... and happy I was just as the ... and the more I had a feeling that I Can't do it any longer and that has to go\nIt was only last year that you left in the position of the day after you that we all know it was pretty well established by then why did you stay for so long\nSo for two years from two thousand Fifteen to twenty thousand Seventeen I was into a position in the party so I was trying to get these very radical members out of the party or at least out of the important positions\nBut did you really think that was possible because the AFC while its position on most things is pretty well known and understood by everyone isn't it\nYeah it's a ... it was a bit ness bought the courts\nInsects and me and I was knowing the person who got my position when what leaf and he was very radical and I was really scared about him and it was really hard for me to leave my place to to leave all these inferences allowing within\nYes and you've by studying you've collected well an extraordinary story which you've written in your book inside I F D and you have threats as a result of writing this book\nYeah absolutely um that was a problem before because I was in a position to the radicals in the FD but when I leave the party then I recognize that there is no\nSelf control to some members they uh they sent me a message so about ... cans of to me and my family or wishing me to get raped or or\nTo be killed or something like this but I ... and I uh I could\nGive people hope close a lot of persons in

going to happen\nSo dad or the German constitutional protection Institute I think they have to make the procedure starting to forbid the FD course\nThe leader of the party addicts and like all and you open the last ... party Congress and then he said that it should be a resolution\nAnd this revolution should stop at the streets\nHe might say that but he and his policy is sounding for election yes and I am a classic and if you vote for him surely that's democracy in action\nYes but we are in Germany we have to experience from the ... that there are some positions at parties should never took an in Germany we have some\nThat red lines what you can't say without being forbidden as a party and if you say you want to attack the democracy then there is a constitutional protection Institute and

is in the process of withdrawing America from the Paris Agreement which is the only international agreement to tackle climate change\nThe front runner in the presidential election in Brazil\nThe fact of the Gulf state of its climate initiatives and action so I think we go to a situation where lots of governments around the world a signed up to the rhetoric\nOf doing things about this is some of them on a person is phasing out the burning of coal for example other countries of set very ambitious targets of their own but some of the biggest player is particularly America the world's largest economy that just not going to buy into this at a political\nLevel so if this report has not yet focused minds in governments want could\nThere are some very interesting changes in technology and industry so for example Fifteen ten years ago if you look to renewable sources of power particularly soda and when they were very expensive\nPlaces to those and sources of energy of not tumbles I'm interested in the last five years in some cases that comparable to\nThe cost of burning coal so you see a massive shift where suddenly in a lot of countries you're getting the construction of solar

the main PT leaders will say he's also talking at a time when Brazil's are experiencing a really deep economic recession so people are really hurting\nAnd the country is suffering from a giant crime wave to events crystallized his support before the election\nOne was the disqualification of the Workers Party former president Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva who has been jailed for corruption\nAnd then there was another thing that happened that drove up votes for both so now to he was attacked during the campaign he was stabbed and so therefore he got this big sympathy vote and it meant he couldn't

the trend in his ...\nPoll out saying that he will out a win then the next round\nWhile we're likely to see is the kind of thing that both an hour has been talking about the number one priority is being the relaxing of laws and rules the security forces allowing them to shoot first ask questions second\nHe also talks about uh putting more thieves in jail he's like each you give us a pro business economy\nBut it'll maybe be a bit of a pro Trump trend in his government he also is very anti China just like Trump he's promised for example to stocks the Supreme Court was sympathetic judges perhaps again taking Mr Trump's lead\nAnd he's very suspicious of politicians and so he's surrounded himself with former generals and solving general so we may have a very conservative

action when necessary\nYet so far this storm seems to be largely limited to the media and entertainment industries which not only have more female employees than most other sectors in India but they're also known to have more outspoken women\nPretty much all the stories we've had in the past few days have come from women living in India cities because yeah there's more awareness and better access to platforms like social media\nSo followed me to stolen hasn't even touched smaller towns orderly India\nBut as a glimmer of hope that even if only a small section of women is feeling empowered at least it's a start selling about feeling triumphant that men guilty of sexual harassment must be sending sleepless nights wondering when they might be called out\nOf school says also a worry that in this bus no testimony let frenzy innocent men might also find themselves being publicly maligned even before they have a chance to defend themselves\nAs a journalist covering the story

those options that we analyzed and hopefully we could avoid dangerous levels of climate change\nWe know if that were not happen then for example if we could expect reductions in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them unhealthy or\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to

future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put CIA too into the atmosphere I think really false making a quarter of well generational ready and moving suicide by twenty twenty three according to the latest incidents\nUniversities David Keith ... solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power\nSuggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he took me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter buys being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent and the and\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power has always connected so if you take a lot of energy out of one place\nThere's less energy somewhere else that's really the core things conservation of energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take and then she from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the arguments are most ah\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest as heat and the energy of evaporated water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around heat and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nJust a patient of energy and the winds that matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat and momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heated momentum and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observations of warming at wind farms says at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil will motives that it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to work on the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is at night yes how much different effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit of a ... but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region were large wind farms are\nSeem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that but the issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so wind turbines are immensely better than coal and we have\nTo be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we do carbon I\nSuppose what I'm saying is one wouldn't phone on a global scale either I'm supposed to have a big event you'll modeling is the last numbers of wood and phones\nYeah but one when farmers and have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs that's not true for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very intimate decimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduces\nThat one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs is just slightly dented the benefits of wind farms are watching you know it's all together\nI don't think it wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current called generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of us have to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community begin to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as of winter around race basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet and we get a number it's more like half\nA watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of between a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not simple because I Know that you were very interested in solar power and I believe that the ... ... square meat or you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more what's per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will have environmental and social him back\nNothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transition we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power what have you and the big important are finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than the land footprint of win for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that that there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new rules on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at these timeline on active duty Keith climate there's a link to his papers by his blog site to via our Web page at BBC World service still call them\nThat like most scientists they was happy to talk to us because he wants to publicize his work the process of songs goes something like this\nFind something out tell everyone else about say by publishing the details\nBefore the speech delays publication was generally done through a profit making journal and a half the bully that was delivered to your door by post
