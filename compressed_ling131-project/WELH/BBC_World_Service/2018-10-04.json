attacking America attacking the world anti Doping Agency without being approved\n... one of those things is that the security services often do is kind of like preparing public opinion full we need more money to take the result is it part of one of those I didn't\nGet that I think in some of the attacks you can see there's a clear Russian motive to destabilize Ukraine to obfuscate or in the anti

Russian editor\nNow the Chinese military is alleged to have been involved in a sophisticated cyber spying attack\nOn almost that the U.S companies insensitive government agencies\nBloomberg Businessweek magazine says it took the extensively to government and business so says\nTo uncover evidence Chinese agents implanted almost invisible microchips into computer networks used in some of America's largest companies and department of defense data centers navy bullshit NASA both houses of Congress and the department of homeland security potentially\nThey would have had valuable access to commercial and government secrets Joe Weber is Bloomberg Businessweek editor\nThere's multiple companies here but the one that's kind of most interesting I think it's called super micro super micro make what are called stripper mother boards and they are a U.S based company and their manufacturing is done in China\nSo a server mother board is basically the the first little pagan the food chain of off something that we call the hardware supply chain most people are familiar with software hacks\nWhat we're talking about here's something completely different and far more troubling which is called the hardware and according to our reporting\nSuper micro or was infiltrated by the Chinese military who embedded small tiny trip about the size of grain of rice on super microbes boards during manufacturing from there think of this conveyor belt of this technology supply chain\nThat super micro can lead to other companies right so that's what we're talking about what the reach of of what our sources or call an attack by the Chinese military\nAnd can you give us a concrete example of how these microchips could be used to disrupt systems\nSo it's not about disruption a hardware hack like this is about access with the chip allowed the Pilates perhaps accomplish was to have something that would create almost a hidden doorway\nVia hardware that would be basically undetected on the network by the people who manage the networks\nSo what's the recipe would be the aim of the Chinese implanting these in the first place\nOkay so according to our sources this again is all about access and access if you're on a network that belongs to a corporation or a business would be about a acquiring intellectual property for instance if it's on a government network it could be about sensitive information not all companies\nAre looking for this or even monitoring for it and that was why we put troops to publish it it was in the public's best interest to know that this\nStyle of an attack is a real threat we only talked about software hacks and we need to be talking about hardware ... for the first\nTime you're no doubt this is an attempt at espionage\nYes the events in the story took place in twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nThe investigation they us investigation which is top secret remains on going into these at science so we don't know how this continues to manifest itself but it's interesting when there's so much talk\nOf a U.S trying to trade war and there are tariffs that impacts stuff like networking capabilities and and micro electronics and and this is in that category so you begin to understand that there's a bigger backdrop to the story so what was the scale of the attack\nSuper micro at the time and twenty Fifteen supplied almost nine hundred customers\nWere according to our sources almost thirty war U.S companies were infiltrated with this attack\nAccording to our sources so there is a distinction there that's an important one that this was not something that was going after an iPhone or not say anything like that but it was an attempt to get too sensitive company information and governments\nThat was Joel whether the editor of

last night at allegations about ...\nBut the leader of the Democratic policy minority in the United States Senate Chuck Schumer said Democrats had been rights to worry that the FBI I wouldn't be allowed fully to investigate the allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nWe had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefings on the documents that in those fears have been realized\nA correspondent Dario Donohue joins me now live from Washington what have Republicans and Democrats you've seen the report suggests they'll do it's clear that as divided as Gary\nLots of people that have been doing all day long courtship taking great lumps out of one another critical for soft oppressed called for speech after speech less is fly all over the place or there's a lot of noise a few role but really there's not much that can be done now I think\nMaking the best of eight a bounce ... seems to be the case is that those wavering Republicans who were the great hope for the Democrats they'd come that way and help defeat the nomination\nThey seem to have been reassured to some extent by what's happened and uh once once that was once that was going to happen that it's really ... there's a bit of a fire and fury you might say\nA today but uh what what getting towards the end game now\nAnd various Democrats said they were suspected that the White House would stop the FBI fully investigating and they say that this report bad as that out when will other people see evidence or otherwise of that well new will\nSit for the reporting cells apart from the Senate says in some of this stuff is one copy of it and they've been ah traipsing enough to read it all day long brother do get on ... now is\nA but the the the Democrats have been saying yes the postage is incomplete inquiry it's been\nA sort of open stretch it by the White House and they point to the fact that the FBI interviewed nine people where they said they should have been to be two dozen people there's a whole list of people to hold a group of people coming out today said no one else ... we were at Yale with Brett Kavanaugh and no one else stuff\nWe could tell you a single two oldest kind of thing but I as I say I think they see is\nThey seem to sort of dying breath really a of the fights\nOr because the Republicans are going to push forward with a procedural votes where art or that after a good way to boring such you know as a side and and then like on Saturday they will probably have their vote tomorrow just this procedure can give us a very clear indication about which way the wind is blowing and I think they're they're pretty sure it's like that way\nYeah and the upshot will be the judge Kavanaugh will be appointed presumably\nYes yeah I mean that's duty once once you've done he's done and then he has to be sworn in a member of the spring pools would have been sitting in his sort of knew said eight states from sort of October to G nuts I'm\nA ... been ... for a week though have been some oral arguments some of those ... those cases may have to be kind of re HUD\nUh in order to to get him into

like that\nSo they may have to reduce some of that but he would let it be a week's worth er and then I think what will happen then use that\nAre the Democrats will attempt to try and motivate the base
