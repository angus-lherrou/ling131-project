Afghans away from polling stations nonetheless millions didn't turn out on the results will be declared next month\nThe government of president Ashraf Ghani is likely to hail approach that says evidence of progress on the road to stability\nBut we all the rhetoric want as reality looked like the Taliban operate with impunity in waves of territory the national security forces are short on numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my gosh this President Ghani has recently appointed national security advisor how do you fully Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat with little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country\nWell having dilemma he joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome to haul took ... to be here we speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you a shame that the\nWay voters elections works out with\nPossibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and lack of government control of key parts of your territory like Bruce Lee exposed ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedence attacks on polling stations the Afghan people defied all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the aft on people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end the s F\nA I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those\nThree or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not but let's let bravery for one second but here's the reality of your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country\nDidn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar and the guy's name a that was no voting because of security concerns of course there may be some more voting next week we're not quite sure we know that your own\nA transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy's a plus the thousands killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling stations one has to conclude\nThat off the Seventeen years off post Taliban governance the government than Afghanistan is still not delivering for its people\nI issued a statement our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to part of the season started ... that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful augment mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people are in the west in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said\nThe ... so exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life\nUnknown gains because our country is not secure\nHe said that of nights I was operations and of course\nThe operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one could almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government\nAll of this loss of life either from nighttime forces all from your own Afghan forces unfold loss because this is you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government um they have their own opinion what I can say to you or\nIs this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show is to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see it from the TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there's only so much news\nA space for one son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate but this is a transform country whether you look at it\nPhysically or you look at it socially I'm a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war or our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nOr to help us along that way and know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste yeah that's where a war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping and equipment and training our security right is it\nPeople deserve we ... we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot things ... you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them but he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as\nQuickly as possible one thing mood in America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formerly the head of Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contracted force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nIt's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our allies we're fighting terrorism or and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now\nIt turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan\nEnvoys ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time we told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with the negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire where where\nDo you allow us because we have to get millions yeah I don't think it'll stay straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports it's sources saying quote\nFills that I had the meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban\nJust uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly ... them and Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just want confirmation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nThat just because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ambassador you didn't know you asked me very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't ask to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans\nHave decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the American seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident uh dictate an entire policy or that's ...\nStands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way for its success\nIt's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... through a process right on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's rights to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell where the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite that threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place and knocked on society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see he wet weather the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that drives fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in a democratic process and let the African people choose\nHow

that the idea not that you might go back to there being any sort of the it presents or a military presence or anything like that along\nThe border of deep concern to people\nPeople took the risk of violence returning if there is April will to we established between the Irish republican ... and it's a real threat\nI think that it is you know when people talk about a return to the trouble is I don't think that that's realistic I don't think we're going to go back to decades of sectarian strife\nI think all the hard border would introduce would range all the way from street protests on maybe civil disobedience to physical violence from small groups so gifted and Republicans on what our most senior police officer in Northern Ireland the chief constable George Hamilton said\nIs that if there was any sort of border infrastructure or people in those people that are ... and all that work\nWould become a target than it is the police Judy to defend people who are being targeted says if the police then arrive at the border then they become a target as well so the play service here how serious concerns about ... a new a hard border breaks it would mean from a security point of view if\nAll that people in ... and not into it would actually like to see the ball to come back well\nEverybody says you know the political parties in Northern Ireland devote pursue Asians all say that they don't want to be a hard border but I think that people are suspicious that some people might actually want to see a hard border because\nUnionism view is that north and on and can be treated any differently to the rest of the case was in the future if there was any trade deals that the Northern Ireland wouldn't be excluded from that\nWhereas the majority of the party's view the boxed off as sort of the best of both worlds I was speaking to some business leaders are for the last few days and they said to me you know we've had in our hands because we're being offered this opportunity to have this sort of best of both worlds arrangement on it's not being accept us\nHow much of a discussion topic is so the people on the day to day basis and what you are in South ... is it something that you know most people are talking about a lot of the time\nIt's something that everybody's talking about a day in day or walk Brexit has done is put the issue of the constitutional position high up onto the agenda where maybe it hadn't pain in the past the PC that sort of felt the constitutional\nHere are talking about Irish unity and the way that wasn't on the agenda beforehand so it's interesting that union is seen the ... with strength and northern Ireland's union with Britain whereas people who would never have been talking about the idea of Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland\nBecoming one that they're not talking about that as a serious consideration and some people who would actually have identified as one of the British union aside if things are nice starting to soften up to the idea so it's a very interesting set of circumstances and certainly it's something that's being discussed on a daily basis you know every radio show every\nTV show every talk show every pulling all of these questions Milwaukee one for the future of Northern Ireland you know how do you feel like\nThe idea of Irish unity\nWhere in the middle of this big storm and everybody's looking at us not least because we're going to be the border between he and the u._k. but also in the context of the pie propping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where\nTheir views have to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that they've never had to do before\nThat was freelance journalist Amanda focus and talking to my colleague ... ... you're listening to business daily and today we're exploring the issue that could and Britain's Brexit negotiations the Irish border all\nIts history of division explains why the ... has become such a sticking point for the Brexit negotiations that's an old to a parent\nIn the British Parliament this week wet pro breakfast and piece from the British prime minister his own party have been threatening to try and asked to that has been lurid talk of a political assassination of foot with Theresa May ... anonymous sources have called the killings on\nShe survived so far but the border issue remains so how might it be resolved if indeed it ever is I'm joined by all UK politics correspondent Rob Watson\nNow it's been a tough week for Teresa maybe you could see it on site ... how she felt this way ... ... you're absolutely\nRight you could say that most weeks and I think there's a long level she has some good some bad days in some different ... relationship with her I can only describe it as a ... divided conservative conflict\nBut I think what doesn't change is the big picture which really does look rather grim and challenging for her and that is how long enough to she got a deal about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe that somehow satisfies yes that the brawl divided conservative policy\nWhich doesn't want any businesses in the ... march which doesn't put a ... and on and and and and that was enough which satisfies the e twenty seven\nSyrup you've laid out a complex set of conditions that needs to be felt that all the different policies that needs to be satisfied but actually the parameters of that is a fairly clear up because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to see how the\nYou're absolutely right I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible ... that we are in that if you like there's a contradiction in the Bronx at projects that you as prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to strip it back to basics Justin and if you\nIf you think about it what what was what was leave all about so it was taking back like quote control of bulldoze\nAll ... ... ... a well it's quite tricky to figure out how you do that and have friction let's trade with the European Union and not have a Boulder and all the non if unless of course the European Union was to say\nGuess what you can actually have a ... do you kind of something special we will recognize British rules and regulations\nAs in hot equivalent ... and that is why we are in the fix that we're in the basically Britain has been saying we\nNone of the things that we didn't like and he was saying was she gotta be kidding\nSo what we're seeing is the ... middle of a negotiation about how much did they say is brinkmanship how much that is both sides kind of holding out for the best deal they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within the positions of the tree policy\nI think some of it as brinkmanship I don't think that you feel like compromising by much cause that things will hang on a minute you know the people who voted to leave it's you'll mess\nYou clear it up and clearly Theresa May doesn't go very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions and our policy so I guess what's gonna happen as if I had so rarely if someone put a gun to my head was to say that that will be maybe they'll scrape together a deal but one that\nPuts off all those issues that we've been talking about justice ... exactly will the future relationship\nBe won't will happen with trade what will happen precisely ... about the ball just so they sort of settle on making sure that there is in chaos next march march of next year when Britain leaves the European Union\nBut all those issues who's going to compromise how is the future relationship gonna ... that'll get sort of kick tens that transition period between next march and the end of twenty twenty\nBullets and if they can't agree again if that is struggling to agree just on the divorce agreement just on this withdrawal agreement then how life is it that that will come to a final settlement they'll come to\nThe the ... enough compromise between the two parties to come to a settlement that there'll be able to actually a fun life some kind of a deal for ...\nIt's a fantastic question and of course it's it's one in a way when when he was good at is what drives Brexit if people really enthusiastic about ... crazy they hang on a minute that this these talks transition could go on forever and ever\nBut it also ball those people who would have preferred to remain in the European Union who said this is just looks like a recipe for kind of chaos and disaster Britain's soles of in the European Union but ... in it so now that plot prospects of a long long process pleases neither remain as an all leave us\nOkay let's just go back to the issue that these programs about the Irish border that's struggling to a great for the withdrawal agreement for this divorce agreement how are they going to come to a Sacramento and the and the longest I bought my assessment of the border look like who's likely to compromise\nBut it's an immensely difficult question just and of course some really smart people have been looking at it for two years and of course\nYou know the the reason there's nowhere in the world whether it's notable the mother to country song and the customs union or in a way the ... when the u._k. trying to do the impossible I suspect\nThe compromise and the short term and it will only be able to show some will be that the whole of the u._k. would have to stay on the customs union until a future relationship is works out with Maine\nNo native would be such a close trading

studio not welcome to the program um explain how this drug was how is it different\nOh thank you I'm happy to be here and what's not new is how the drug I mean effectively killed\nAnd clever about this is how they engineered the bacteria to enter the cell they really exploit an unnatural procession of the bacteria to import and it actually is an act with a Trojan Horse it actively imports the drug which effectively kills it\nSo the bacteria sort of welcome the drug into south without realizing what it is\nYeah I think it's a lot of fun because the scientists cleverly exploited and natural\nHost pathogen interaction\nThe bacteria needs to import\n'em iron in innocence for its own replication as soon survival and what's clever is this drug ... attached to free iron inside our bodies and therefore the drug imports the iron but unknowingly imports the drug at the same time and from inside the cell or the drug does its job\nUh what do you make of the trial it was a fairly

durability of treatment or the long term a clinical impact\nSo I think the exciting that the style was the study was performed it really looks promising now we have to do more extensive test to see how long it lasts at how well it performs\nThis is the way the research is going to be looking at clever ways of of getting antibiotics into the system if you like\nI think we have no choice we really need creative ways to control the infection pro says a bacterial evolution is a very strong force and if we can exploit natural processes of our immune system to engineer clever ways to deliver the drug I just think this\nFor example this is just a great example of modern medicine and I think they should inspire other research Japanese also thinking like this to exploit natural processes of the bacteria\nBut all innovations keeping up with the power to resistance\nI think now that we're aware of it in ... in an antibiotic resistance is such an urgent health threat it's an exciting time as a scientist because we have studies like this really leading the way and there is an appetite for innovative therapy so I as a researcher I think it's an exciting\nTo our listeners will want to know a a a scientist swimming that battle or are we going to see even greater levels of resistance and therefore more people getting sick\nYeah it would be irresponsible for me to say the work is done there there is waiting to go this is a small victory it's a clever study um that there will forever be work to do and it's an ongoing battle with evolution whenever enough results has been poured into it you think\nWell there's never enough resources considering it just the global impact of this health threat\nI'm In ... in terms of this study we're not even sure if evolution to this new drug could one day emerge and that's super important factor ... to consider and longer term studies of this drug maybe it's impossible to engineer resistance against this I Believe we'll get there\nAnd I was

time alone with horse racing and bill rich one's name is mentioned many many times that newspapers up and down the country the medical boxes of that time was huge huge celebrities the primary ships

Richmond came into English as a teenager under the patronage of El Paso usually it was an English so Joe\n... who was fighting the war at that time exactly why policy brought Richmond die between ... not quite clear about its it's\nBill Richmond is also a bit of a mystery because he himself died not long after bill Richmond left America and the rest of his slaves ... somebody else he didn't for any of them say why was he allowed Richmond together\nIs a little bit mysterious he with his parents that also is something that we don't know I mean his boss is no record that in the parish registers I have a theory which is the\nBill Richmond was a mixed ethnicity and I think it's possible that maybe the Reverend Sharpton himself with somebody from his household may have been ... father and that might explain why he allowed to leave all gave him his freedom but that is only a theory\nAnd so how did he make his way when he came to British and that because it was a while before he started getting a vote in boxing wasn't it\nIt was I mean initially he was in the past the household up in the northeast of England and I'll pass you have to say it was a sort of on commonly and the lights on and kind and generous man in short the bill was educated he was given a cost in reading and writing he will say that had him a friend to still cabinet maker as well say bill actually lots of trade so that was\nQuite a few black systems in Britain at that time but I think that what many who could read and write and to try and cabinet maker says well say bill was fortunate in having such a generous and kind patron\nBut he did stop and boxing and as you say it forward and fame and prestige and and the attentions of members of the aristocracy as well he won't get people into the wanted to learn how to be better Fox's\nYeah he he had several different rooms or gems way he taught members of the hour stopped for say an an so on an instructor to the altar boxing and he was seen as one of the best books and she says of the day competitively he didn't actually stop medical boxing until he was in his forties which I think it's quite extraordinary\nDid he have Italian family\nYes see married when he was living in New York sharing the Seventeen Ninety he married a white English will unquote Mary we very much about how do we do know that they stayed married throughout the rest of his life started they had several children as well as\nPart of the reason I always thought of cool ... thinking about the possibility that we might find his remains and I guess attention then turns to his ancestors and whether there are any still alive\nYeah I Would absolutely love tonight so far I've tried everything I come to find somebody who's related to bill Richmond and I'm drawing a blank the traces of his children die ousted about the Eighteen forties or fifties in terms of public records it's possible that maybe some of them emigrated abroad\nSo as of yet I have not found them living relative a bill Richmond if we could find living relatives we could put some of these theories to the test in terms of his parents' age I'm trying to discover more about his genetic makeup\nSo what would you want to happen to his remains if they are found\nI Would like DNA Analysis to be done if possible my theory that I was talking about he may be related to the Charleston family they're all members of the Charles and family who we could maybe get solved was from an America that quite a prominent family in religious articles and if we could have stopped they ... they were connected with
