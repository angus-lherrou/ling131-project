beginning when I came to Mumbai um and I thought of a always avoided um that sort of group and the people who are ...\nWorking with them I always ended up working with people who later became friends and then I kept repeating working with them\nSo up to be honest I avoided a hug ... problems and the way you deal with them is to avoid working with him to do where you vocal against these people that are passed these\nYes in the beginning I just said that okay no thank you I work with some other people because I I I don't I I Know with a ... or something like this but if you know the thing is it's never did act it's always it comes in I'm In a suggestion\nAnd when I got that suggestion I just I just said that will get fined I'm not going to need that person anymore\nAnd so in the beginning in the first one to yours my career that's what I did and then in the industry everyone has a reputation right so the reputation spread that she is never going to do it [laughter]\nSo then it became like the sort of a mutually repulsive a situation where I Would not go to them and they will not even on to mean that those because\nThey know that it's not going to happen with me and uh so I ended up working with people um and I continuously ended up working with people repeatedly working with people who became friends and\nWho really meant professionalism and walk and uh there was no pressure on you know and that was the old ... and that was your way of dealing with it and then there's some the editor of the news\nThat Mitch told the BBC so many allegations have come a have come out now and something needs to be done about ... you've had the time and again when it comes to sexual harassment in India the ... are you confident that something will be done about this\nI think I think it's gonna take dime but what is a wonderful is that the youngest was are really really courageous it wasn't like that then you know back Fifteen Years back when I started working\nLike I wouldn't ah come out in public in the presidency that also and so I Try to do that with me and that's I'm not looking at so and so right right I Would just say okay like forget about it I'm not looking at that person because you might try to do that I because I felt as there isn't in in in when during a suggestion\nSo I said okay fine I Walk with each other a lot of people right but not want it because it it's

right to serve as female moms today it is still too many Muslims as something very rare and and strange and before we started the mosque two years ago in Denmark\nThe majority of Muslims in Denmark didn't even know that scene in moms was a possibility and why it's because we have normalized these patriarchal structures within religious institutions for decades\nSo you see is your job in the ...

abroad and we're not only talking this is about creating change on the ground\nAnd if we look at the ... at changes that we have made so far and let me give you an example then assess a T of interfaith marriages today\nMuscle and they cannot marry outside their faith unless the men converts to Islam unless you are cultural muscle and you do not\nReally practice on so this is actually an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even UK to get married in the mosque because we are able to serve them and we are\n... the Koran and with a focus on gender equality allowing less than women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they've changed the law last year and a separate Seventeen so now it's also legally a possible to marry outside Islam for a
