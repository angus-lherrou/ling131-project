the limits of the constitution entitles the oath and the office\nSo and I said President Trump's recent comments about Dr foods testimony he's he surprised how vigorously President Trump has subsequent he defended Brett Kavanaugh\nYes I saw to completely contradicted both what he said and what those of us who watched her testify saw which was a obviously credible witness who didn't look like she had any sort of partisan agenda but it was just relating what had happened to her and so it's a you know suspicious and say the least that he's changed course like this I think he's feeling empowered\nOr he also doesn't like opposition and what our system of government in the United states is about\nThe notion that the Senate confirmation hearings has an equal co equal role to the president and deciding whether to come from a Supreme Court justice but this is a president who doesn't know much care much about constitutional government and a sees himself as an authoritarian

government\nWhy do you think he invested so much in getting Brett Kavanaugh concerned despite the political cost the parent political costs of that because that must be a hundred judges in America who hold very similar views\nAre one suspicion is that because Brett Kavanaugh has spoken so much about executive power including his skepticism of a case USB Nixon which\nIs one of the most important

London who started the concept of cruel and her two thousand and sixteen book the buzz of cruel style narratives of the African diaspora\nWelcome to all three of you have to start with I won't talk to each year in time if you could just pick one example of who or what is the perfect example of cool for you personally and why\nPutting me of cool because of the concept changes every generation a little bit but\nSince it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Muhammad Ali the heavyweight boxer\nAnd Ali although universally admired now a mostly white Americans hated Ali when he took them you know some name and trash talk as a boxer so he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that cool had to change into something more confrontational\nAnd so she didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he went to prison for three years at the prime of his career forefront in probably ten million dollars in their earnings and he famously said about Vietnam I'm not going to fight white people sending black people to fight yellow people to protect the country they stole from the right people\nSo he was an activist even though Americans thought he was in fact sort of\nNot keeping his place as an African American close yeah what about you\nI'm going to name two people prince and David Bali ... cool they had called styles and they may call music they were somewhat mysterious and unknowable and they continue to define cool even after that deaths in twenty six team\nKinda what about you [noise] I'm gonna reference to people family holiday and Mrs Gloria banned from Duncan stern Southfield shift and the reason why I have chosen to women from different parts of the world Billie Holiday of course there's the famous giants artist\nAnd then he comes up she's um style\nIvy League style and this meant um jackets and yes Chuck kitchen is high and things like that he would buy clothes from shops on\nUniversity campuses in the United states whether it's bound with play so there's an um an album called amusing of miles that he's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise] so it's very unusual even Nineteen fifty five [noise]\nHe's in a um ... jacket beautiful pale colors to fight club for cap a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling you still working directly into the camera and for me he's saying I'm black therefore I Am deal with it\nSo he's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style of young white men you choose expense of universities but on dressing like this is\nKind of claiming it for himself ex athletes not just for one group it can be for me I'm like why\nWas that this emphasis on style on the on this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public tickets hit but more generally in special times because he said something about your family or how this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties where we still British colonial subjects posed was important to them\nTo stretch this idea of visibility that sense of pride\nMaking a life for themselves and Britain despite all in spite of the racism to pull up our system that was rising in Britain the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties so there was this continuous\nActually feel like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nSo up to this point we defined cool is largely an African American concept something that was developed by just musicians as a result of being on the outside of not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity of the idea of crew was manifesting itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one and cash and buying one time [noise]\n\nMall and Jimmy Johnson all accounts and all of them were\nWalks in a mine [noise]\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick plane on duty Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael couches and clearly this was a new type of crude which book consent to the Hollywood movie audience with the new ... what was known as Phil ... how does too while relate to cool\nWell filmed water protagonists are disillusioned I'm cynical the owners who often get embroiled in criminal activities [noise] this type of curse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detect affection [noise]\nIn the shadow ... why world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why don't you think there's this idea these heroes he's cool here is so resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface ah America was celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country\nIt was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future\nSo for film the wire to ah refused that to reject optimism was a ... way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt marginalized so in cinema\nUh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic that film in the war was not this was a John or that was steeped in gloom and cynicism and disillusionment\nI'm Joe you said that the cool appeal let's assume law is linked to the post war popularity in front says ... says like oh but ... ... can you briefly explain why\nIn a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence\nOr Albert camera writes a book called the rebel a study of men and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy\nAnd my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool it she says that a rebel therefore we exist\nAnd what he meant by that is if your rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart a Robert Mitch and they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model for fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said Americans sort of patriotism\nAnd so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\nWe into here about ... been talking about film we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and in different sections of society in different countries the thing that strikes me is that all these kinds of who seem to be men where are the women can women be cool to Cairo\nYes they can and I mentioned earlier Billie Holiday as um my example of the epitome of cool Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she is being seen as a female down ... so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity an expresses that in all aspects of their lives and used his clothes and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of mind and ... and ... that means for them\n[noise] okay so that's a a female coup like Conan Josh Cody at what about you and Phil new ah\n[noise] ah in film and why are women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nAh they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film the water from fatality is depicted as dangerous evil ... seemed mostly in dark shadows at night\n[noise] okay so what do you think about this idea that maybe the whether the the icons of who seemed to be mostly men\nOr if you're talking about jazz musicians or film or actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nYour art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to a school in a headline or as a description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the band sonic youth from the eighties or nineties\nAnd since twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chrissie Hi and and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool has never really been associated them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell maybe we will be taking a closer look at how cool developed and how that rebels spirit was taken up by later generations that's in part to if it's

non conformist was actually dangerous as soon as the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings and the Senate people were persecuted I'm for their views this was a time of extreme racism segregation persisted in the south\nI'm homophobia massage any were extreme levels and young people who are chafing against all kinds of restrictions um identified wholeheartedly with James Dean and Marlon Brando\nLet's hear from the Nineteen fifty five film rebel without a cause with James Dean as the archetype teenager struggling with his parents\nWe give you love and affection don't we all well then what is it was\nIt because we wanted to that party well you know what kind of drunken brawl those kind of artist turn into starting place for kids\nTo go you said you didn't care if they drink said a mental thing\n\nYou know you'll say why do they have another\nWay to have you know he takes after\nJames Dean Jim Baucus I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas Ray of course this was a film ... for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point you had these with a new teenagers very much opposed wool phenomenon\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time\nOr to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time for perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city's after World War two people move to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do they are so you've had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time having the luxury of\nRebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nUm countless style that these films to function came to be seen as crucial to didn't as well as the actions\nOf colas yes and it gave license to teenagers across the world to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the the T shirt to white T shirt fleece everyday object which started um\nAs part of the a nasal uniform in around Nineteen sir teen was seen on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire then warmed by James Dean in rebel without a cause this\nDreaming white T shirt under red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with a a pair of jeans could say some things so radical\nOne of the other major figures from this period we mustn't forget about it that rebels spirit was a singer Elvis Presley\n\n\nJoe\nSo what did Elvis fits into this pantheon of cool Elvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worship\nMarlon Brando and James Dean\nAre actually in the movie could Creole plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando at the commissary on the studio lot he shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that this was a fan boy from Marlon Brando was kind of a shock looking back\nUh but the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with a rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis's first hits were also heads on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something somewhat a rich you know with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition and so although he was often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or is not a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his\nSinging and his take on the African tradition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing and he once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe influx of people like James Dean into Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted to set an idea of cool across the landscape but I Wonder what you will think Kobe really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt sometimes is a certain way it's the power of\nAmerican culture but ten years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line a global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named where I ... we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your what's your view of the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nThat cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures\nAdolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebel style could be used a signal their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression\nPersistent both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers there is I found that to ...\nLa Han from Nineteen Ninety five to occupy much it costs the vets and which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris try to figure out how to respond to police violence the bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish\nOne of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cruel detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about besides your crews cultural imperialism\nFor me it's not just about the kind of chopping down if you like but it was that what ... been saying is that making use if those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a\nParticular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this parade ground away one started the coolest being taken by another generation and turned it into its and and as we've been hearing coup hasn't remains static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that crew which seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream conformity that we've been talking about so was cruel today there's\nConformity cool marketing cool and there's rebel cool and the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things and then there's the grassroots rebel cool in which\nPeople and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming\nBut for me the rebel cool part the part that still vital on alive\nI Would define rebel cool simply dissuade cool is how we can go she ate maternity in late adolescence two kinds of popular culture between like the age of Seventeen and twenty five and we're looking for self definition and you will find yourself and I kind of cool that guides you there\nI'm afraid that's where we got time for like you say much for exploring the roots of cool with me Joe Dennis Jean

created shelf go and they started pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteer who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls a youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was a clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to tell people what to believe in our clinic to people get cholera some people get typhoid sweet

[laughter]\n\n\n\nListening to Kenny tell his life story the Sam ... makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nSolution here and we sell always in our program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions happened and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he street smart he's slum ... if you'd like he knows how to operate the\nYeah I don't want to paint shelf though as a one man band you know Kenny just off on his own doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that Gulf school like I mentioned and the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife\nAnd for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year and his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit last still is a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that to ...\nThey said the salaries in line with organizations if a similar size or everything's been signed off by the ... are paying for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment\nWell they're bringing in a lot of money shelf go just want to two million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation the hotels ... yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with older the what the shelf that does not just the war but there are other projects to buy the only ones who are trying to solve this problem ... not the only game in town\nFor lots of different people I Know when I say shouldn't thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums\nAnd just in Kibera a you know the ... to ... I'm thinking one woman she said and Wonder Woman with ... she was a gladiator a few years back she remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that also dreading bullet holes that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just ... up and passing it out so they got the ... the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation but\nSeveral experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime than illegally at night so it's a complicated picture\n... a lot of different players involved as you said it's how to surf co fits into the\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ... whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure out in the slum itself\nThat means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that come with some people like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet to ... you know fast doing the\nPoint of ... their grassroots organization that led by the parents as folk you baron's they didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental ... remember he said he had invisible ...\nMy mother in law mountain that unlocks the Rosa Parks this is how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people\nIn Kibera men and women who not just sit down and watch when police on what's happening and what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't fit in which white and that was that's a piece of the answer for that to be a year come together [noise] you know [laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThank you Sam for that report and thank you well tax listeners for well listening we hope you can cheat and again next week when will introduce you to another problem solver from another part of the planet [noise]\nAnd if you suddenly realized wait a minute you know a problem so but\nShould be on our radar sharing there in Denver on this program than do send us an email the address is as always world tax a BBC coastal UK we love to hear your suggestions [noise]\nAlso do teach in on our Facebook page called will will will posted video of Chinese aerial piping project and videos of course of all the other stories we do as well until then take care of him goodbye [noise]\n\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has made possible by American public media with support from the three I O T addressing the world's most challenging problems at the convergence of artificial intelligence I O T and elastic cloud computing\nMore at the three I O T dot a high at progressive insurance protecting commercial vehicles and offering specialized coverage is designed to protect small businesses\nFor at progressive commercial dot com\nMm\nThis is Rhode Island public radio more news from the b._b._c.

I don't\nThink it's because that would lend the field moral authority how active excluding when the ... more authority\nAbsolutely and particularly when she got to science being seen as something that's relevant in the public face so women not generally less active in the public say they've been excluded from politics and and so on so that as a mascot and kind of ... ... is going on and on owning a living and so and\nSo when science professionalized is which is actually a very light developments move talking\nLate Nineteen century before ... when you said professional what you mean um it said something way there is a a ... a a kind of a joke that you could name for weather is training whether all existing started societies channels you can publish and\nAnd uh reached by which you can expect to end up living so that's something that really doesn't exist until quite and I told them\nAnd by that point women very much being excluded from those of cheating in historical examples\nIf we look for who is actually paid to do science in the Eighteenth century there's very few places that that happens so the role of searching granted she's one of those places where you might be living by doing scientific work\nIn the nineteenth century you might find it within the navy for example doing surveying what or in geology so doing a geological surveys which becomes interesting for\nYou know finding minds exploiting resources and not kind of thing but you know finding people doing scientific research within universities for example so yeah it's really only later on that you get the kind of scientific career that we would understand that if someone says she paid to do ... particular problem\nIt's just pretty much across the ... the case or is it or are you talking specifically about Europe I'm ... I'm very much talking about the\nWestern European tradition and so what do I get sort of taken up in in America older I'm interested in these are all more opportunities for women in what is a very new in the best the system in say the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach astronomy in women's college so what was that in the U.S in the in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings the women I mean potty often it's a sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there in a way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system impression you've got to look for the Cambridge in England and women's striking for very long time to be given places that I see the thing\nThat you said that when a field is new\nAnd it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I could make it interesting that in when you look at the desk I think is on women in science for example there's some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nThose kind of as the worst of the lowest ones are the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love\nMore about the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing such or are we talking about investing systems\nYou know what is the kind of funding that goes into research with any investigation there's different countries so in some cases\nI suspect that maybe longer if I could sum of women being at higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded and way there are places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly socially stitches then you tend to find women\nFunding and opportunity because men are not taking the option to 'cause there are other things that they would rather be doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full say they're a good example and the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so and you kind of way of doing astronomy\nIn those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing they own\nFollowing the traditional education system they own competing with a lot of stop missed individuals' usually male to publishing in those areas and some interesting late we sometimes find that that gives women an opportunity to lead off and historically there\nThen pushed out so far a typical an iconic ... computer programming which on the on was very much seen as a female role we sort of

inside the Saudi comes to that\n[noise] how much pressure is that on the Saudis now that that you can uh assessed to to be transparent and the way that the United states close very close ally of Saudi Arabia are now calling for them to be well\nI think that there is a sort of public pressure on them behind closed doors pressure side of the public pressure was that for example the tux have announced that they some of the Saudi ambassador twice in the last week\nThat they are demanding full corporation that clearly all these allegations flying around um how how raising pressure last on Saudi

think after every emergency response there are reflections unimportant lessons to be ... and perhaps assist the Indonesian government not only reacting to this response but also learning from the experience is if the other um responses that they've that they let\nInto needs there isn't the first country that has chosen to make a decision like this in India had also made a similar decision often the floods in Karen huh I Wonder if you see this as a as a possible trend imaging it\nCould well be a possible trend on one that we have to understand in the context of shifting\nRelationships between international NGOs and the southern counterparts I think governments are increasingly wanting to make sure that the government on civil society is led sweat in national boat is\nBut also from the other side international NGOs are also reorientate that focus and trying to build strong partnerships in which I'm southern pot and as a taking the lead\nSince then ... implicit in what you're saying that the lead and the control is very often imposed from the outside\nI think so and I think if you look at the um response internationally in terms of donations and both from the public and from governments that's a huge influx from the outside that that the government quite rightfully wants to be able to centralize coordinate a and understand what's going on\nThink the disasters imagine the committee raised six million pounds from the u._k. public on the first day of the response so\nThere is a huge extent ... influx of resources and personnel and in this case the Indonesian government has set right let's put limits on the personnel that's remove those but they're not requesting that foreign funds be restricted\nHe's this is an issue that is informed to a certain extent by national pride issue like\nI think any country in the wild would want to maintain control over what's going on and it's ... I don't think it's particularly surprising that is rooted in pride but it's also rejected in territorial governance or a government wants to know what's going on in the in control of that\nAnd in wanting to be in control all what happens\nAnd how a dissolves the is reacted to in doubt ways could possibly be that a country like in the knees yeah might be causing off its nose despite its face in the context of expertise and and the skills that are required to respond to such disasters\nI think that's an easy assumption to jump too but I also think it's important to reflect\nAnd understand how strong local organizations are in the context a lot of the big international NGOs that we're talking about hey that's a really big stuff may well have local offices out with local and international staff and have trained personnel and expertise on the ground\nSo I Would imagine the Indonesian government have not taking this decision lightly but it's one to to look out for the rapid cautious\n[noise] I was up to the bank speaking to me from the University of Manchester hair in the u._k. says Nissan\nDistribution of BBC News hour in the U.S who supported by T Rowe price\nOffering a strategic investing approach that examines investment opportunities firsthand institutions advisors employers and individuals juice T Rowe price the real price invest with confidence illegals whom helping small business owners get started with a small business started up get which includes educational e books and other resources\nMore information available at legal zone dot com slash start up\n...

ago two years ago now\nWhile you're not do you think because they don't want to you know they like being who they are and they can see as well as I can that someone like say a Bernie Sanders figure is extremely popular and the public would really go for a a you know the kind of policies at someone like that would put in place but that's not what they're interested in they just aren't interested in that they're interested in something else\nIs a category mistake that's not who they are they\nAlso in in some of the front of me that they have gone for\nMore left wing candidates in certain places that you had always are in Nebraska as well as in places like New York state where you might expect that so are are they are they shoot sort of a different policy already starting to rise up ... I was just I I'm\nI shouldn't I shouldn't be so glum and so negative because of course there are examples that you just mentioned there's a guy running for governor in Florida who looks really good there's a Alexandria Ocasio Cortez ... I Believe in the Bronx in New York City she looks really good and these people there's and there's many other examples\nAnd these people make me hopeful there's always some good people and the Democratic party and there's even good people\nWho are making noise is like the running for president in twenty twenty Elizabeth Warren is seems to be suggesting seems to be hinting at that I think she's the best thing in the world I'd love to see her run for president but are you saying that the party machine exactly\nThe yes and I'm thinking more about it's probably unfair to I'm Talking about the Democratic party because the organizations in this country are so diffuse [laughter] they aren't really even organizations\nBut I'm Talking here about the sort of pundit class in America that really sort of determines what nice liberal people think and that pundits class is how would I put this a doubling down on this sort of the philosophy of two thousand and sixteen intensifying their commitment to that philosophy and how would you describe that\nOther groups women minorities\nYoung people that is you know the Democratic party and that's devoted to the Democratic party and that's you know all fine but the important thing is what do you do about the white working class what do you do about this enormous group of voters that have slowly but surely over the decades\nMoved from the Democratic column and to the Republican column and for many years the answer that the sort of pundits class in America would give is that's not happening we don't need to worry about that and then all of a sudden in two thousand and sixteen it became undeniable that that was happening and so their answer now is to say there's nothing we can\nDo about it what if they're going to win big as you suggest in the midterms what's wrong with it if they get power back that's the name of the game isn't it\nIt's short term thing is the problem Democrats often when because when the Republicans screw up\nAnd then the Republicans come back a couple of years later and and get them back this is the natural coming and going of American politics but let me remind you of the way\nThe sort of political situation in this country used to be after the Nineteen thirties and that was at the Democratic party controlled Congress from the year Nineteen thirty up until the year Nineteen Ninety four was only two brief interruptions or the Democratic party was overwhelmingly dominant\nIn this country and the reason for that was because they were a party that was obviously and clearly identified with the interests of working people and that's not the case anymore and they you know they did the Democrats deliberately turn their back on that\nVersion of themselves beginning in the seventies but sort of a coming into fruition in around Nineteen Ninety four and they turn their back on that version of themselves and they have never really recovered from it\nYou posit at the end of your book the unthinkable to Democrats of President Trump getting reelected what would you give us Jones is at the moment\nNo remember I had all sorts of ... there that I said if if he you know this is all off if he gets impeached or if he does if he messes up the economy with one of his dumb trade wars or if he gets in a real shooting war you know which he could easily do\nThan all bets are off but the way things are going right now I hate to say this as you have no doubt\nGuessed I'm pretty far to the left I think Trump has a very good chance of being reelected in twenty twenty you don't think the Democrats have a candidate up their sleeve who can talk to those votes as they need to get back into the fold they do there are Democrats out there who can do that the problem is that if the country stays on the track that it's on right now\nThe economy running flat out the accelerator down unemployment getting less and less and less if that continues I don't know who can I remember the period of the Nineteen nineties when we had\nThis sort of boom economy of the Nineteen nineties and there was real wage growth for a couple of years and Bill Clinton became incredibly popular you know like sixty Seventy percent approval ratings and this was this was when he was in the middle\nIs a process of being impeached you know it was it was the most incredible thing and I can't help but think that if you get that kind of economic situation again almost doesn't matter\nWhat the other side does ...\nWas the American author Thomas Frank on his new book Rome they've with oblivion reports from
