panel on climate change started work on a report looking into how ... even more ambitious target of one and a half degrees could be achieved\nThe PCC document has just been released at that meeting in South Korea Jim scare is co chair of one of the IPC working groups\nIf we don't ... on top substantial reductions in carbon dioxide emissions over the next decade or we are really making it very challenging to impossible to keep warming below one point five degrees so this is a very clear message saying\nOption acts for auction why is not the way this report is framed the idea that you can leave anything I just know false civil so the key thing is ... ... ... ... is the only option we really have to achieve this kind of life ...\n... is that the conference in South Korea for the BBC Matt um it took us three first of all the importance of this one off degree level\nJust like they are as you say the government says out through over the last number of years to look at the science of one point five and the FBI PC to do\nYou make clear that's the difference between keeping warming at one point five and letting it goes to two degrees is huge and will be felt all around the world in many different ways\nIt says up to ten million people could have their homes flooded are could lose their homes in some shape or form from extra sea level rise that would be caused by two degrees as opposed to one point five\nWe use all the corals that's left in the world have two degrees we keep some of it at one point five and there are many many other examples in terms of food in terms of fishing in terms of a whole range of of issues so\nThey're all really hammers home the idea that one point five really is the safest level and then going for two degrees comes with a lot of dangers but it also points out that getting two one five five are keeping the world at one point five degrees of warming is a massive massive challenge so what\nKinds of things with one have to do to keep it at one and a half degrees\nWell as you heard Jim scare say there there's literally you know it's not just one all the other is almost everything so those things include cutting emissions carbon

honest I haven't really been a fight or tested just yet\nNot this is a big question just a few to sum up in thirty seconds but to give it a go at the political climate has changed a lot since Paris

technically feasible it's physically feasible as financially feasible it doesn't go near policy that says that's up to the politicians I think that's obviously the big question ... says it seriously alarming and somewhat hopeful that we can make one point five but there are questions that has to be answered not by scientists by political leaders will be missing later this year\nProductive and

were lettering in inspectors to have a look at the ... nuclear test site now this is this the only new nuclear test site which was partly destroyed in front of a news reporter is earlier this year there was a lot of criticism at the time that it was done in front of the porches ... inspectors\nSo at least that would be a step forward to let inspectors into the country if indeed that does happen\nYeah it's this idea of having concrete verifiable concessions from Pyongyang isn't it and it still seems to be a bit of a change from from your\nThey say this that change I mean some analysts who have been looking at these sites for a long time will tell you\nThat North Korea doesn't actually need this nuclear test site anymore\nThey have had at six successful nuclear tests\nThey are capable of launching in ... test elsewhere perhaps they might be happy with their current technology but also capable of launching missiles from ... so they perhaps don't need to get any any more so when it comes to this particular site many are saying well this is a bit of a useless that\nBut even a loving nuclear inspectors into the country would be a step forward the last time they were there

your analysis on the feasibility and the moment but first give us a quick round up of what the report is saying we've been talking for ages about two degrees limiting the rise in temperature two degrees then I'll say that isn't enough why and what needs to be done\n[noise] yeah so we need to go to the Paris summit thousands is the largest one up until that point to Celsius high in the sort of the great political soggy\nBut emerging from that Congress was an agreement that governments would make efforts to restrain a global woman to one point five Celsius so they commissioned this report from the edge of governmental panel on climate change\nAnd really what scientists have been done doing in the meantime is to try and work out what the differences in in ... look like a one point five Celsius well too so just well there's some areas there isn't quite striking difference in what what five you cut off as many people exposed to ...\nYou have one the number of exposed regulates extreme heat waves and the impacts on the nature of the different for example you could actually kissed goodbye to coral reefs sea Celsius whereas at one point five up to the deepest sense the mud and divide so quite significant differences between what's\nInteresting is they trying to emphasize the knowledge and certainly the affordability but the feasibility of some of the solutions that all they really feasible having a look at it with ... these are really major changes to my lifestyle to the world's lifestyle what are they saying needs to be done\nWell that's right if you put it in context we've been using fossil fuels in an industrial complex for about three hundred years and the prescriptions to try and reverse that says he is so massive off I'm essentially you need to bring carbon dioxide emissions down to zero\nBy twenty fifty just study is time I'm not ...\nIn Michigan emissions down to zero absolutely in every sector of the economy can do it and most of them we know how to do it and ... we know how to do and I'm ... we know how to do you think we know how to do in most areas of industry for example it's tough and agriculture and\nMaybe impossible in aviation so you bring the emissions down as close to zero as possible and then you have to do what's cool negative emissions where you actually suck carbon dioxide from the yeah\nAnd that can be done either through things like punching forests are older technologies that do this so it is a massive change but in each of those areas it's feasible technically the question is what is it feasible politically\nRight if they want to see it they will go and of course this kind of marvel movie this is not from Disney's marvel Disney owns the main marvel movies with\nIron Man and the you know the black panther those all came from

science will begin to emerge and look at in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will that be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which rules so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\nWell\nI live right\nOn the other\nSide of\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we were heading for something Robert comma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen those temperatures were not unusually war\nWe were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event in debt usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... raised with scale for wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description outside from friday also which is a great some aren't can you heard of this kind of event you these very specifically giving ... the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast\nAnd so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it made landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has\nAtlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you could pinned down specific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer area and cooler areas but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast initial education so that when we run these modify forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point a degree Celsius\nAs well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that are associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the F F T we actually have a pattern change of the SST that come from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and for that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese conscience of geographical variation ... look on does a bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually\nExpanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming can suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially ... then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months sea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some of those and recovering more poorly each winter\nJulian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seemed kind of self continuing decline in Arctic ice\nOf the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the ... see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice camp and also thick enough\nTo support many people out there doing their their field observations and also we were trying to deploy ... and you know we couldn't find many floods that were very thick so we're putting out these beliefs and\nFive and locations where we put some of our buoys out already went through about ... centimeters of melt since we had deployed than which gets worrying because if the ice gets too thin and ... out then we lose our data\nJulian ... is part of the research is directly related to the climate slash whether issues of this program\nThe reason why we're so interested in the Arctic is that the Arctic is sort of a refrigerator of our planet right so it helps to keep our planet cooler than it otherwise would be and it does is by the fact that it's covered mostly by snow and ice year round\nThis I Believe New England ... each of our website R.

you're just going to have to accept it because we are too big for you to try and find ...\nI Would put your bad there's no way we're going to do this because it's the right thing to do for our economy\nIf the European Commission rejects your budget will then\nWhether or not European Commissioner reject or a ... face the consequences are being two faced separate sample science or something I Do on the European Union where we'd be in that situation but I'm sure\nThat that we are going to defend ourselves in the new parliament and ... and the new European bottle and believe me the balance of powers would be much much you're starting to ...\n... what what is now on having a relation with the new generation off a European nation from France from Germany or something at the end but I'm fairly confident that they are going to use the euro for your will give up your\nSo I'm very optimistic for the future\nThey make us economic spokesman probably a book that so he's holding out for European parliamentary elections next year which might see and you blockers more sympathetic populace candidates voted and also he hopes which ... wife it's nice to do is it likes with its spending plans\nBut why risk does it now posed to the IRS important or even simply the European Union as a whole Jeremy glasses economists columnist and correspondent in Brussels and we can speak to him from that now good morning Jeremy good morning\nCould this be the eurozone's next sulfur in debt crisis\nI think it may well be at the last few weeks had been hopes here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission that Italy's government would be persuaded to back down on some of its spending proposals and tax cuts\nAre not however I haven't been the case in the sense here is that there are people that the commission can talk to in room for people like for example Giovanni tree of the finance minister but then the people pulling the strings and those pulling the strings to the leaders of the two parties in the coalition the leg and the five Star Movement\nHave their own plans on a determined on a confrontation\nWho holds the upper hand in the standoff do you think I mean at the end of the day at ... my parents housing and interior ministers who is the guiding light to the guy is is is not going to back down and say\nI mean ultimately this did you catch it is in the hands of particularly Mr ... who now is the dominant figure in Italian politics he's the he's the interior minister but his leg up hockey has soared in the polls it's now much more popular even in the five Star Movement which was once billed as the\nThe the senior partner not coalition and he is determined to have a confrontation with the European institutions we just heard from ... to ... talk about the European Parliament elections next year\nMr Mr Soviet dramatizing the idea that he's standing up to Brussels and we saw for example when that bridge collapse in ... ... ... a few weeks ago Mr solving immediately blamed your for that Europe's failure to invest in Italian if a structure\nAnd I think that's the conclusion that people here who come to the to the Italian government particularly insofar as it's driven by Mr solving is determined to take on Europe will be seen to take on Europe\nAnd that means a major bust up over this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing headed in the end they'll just have a line that they'll have to tell you that I Know oh could they really take this to the brain can ... really affects the the markets that really affects ... debt all over the years and\nWhen I think I think the the the best case the optimism scene from the European institutions perspective is that the markets will discipline to government you've already talked about Italian public perceptions of low spread so that that the um it's a tiny and governments ... guilt\nArising here but there's a Gemini and and at the same time you hit people ... I mean I was astonished his thinking on your interview with him that he was saying for example you know just what's the difference between one hundred percent ... percent and uh there's no risk ... findings refinancing ... Italy's debt this is not a government\nFor it and and it doesn't seem like government you know especially listening to your interview just now leaving it's helped much room to back down there for this I added to that you have to include the but the fact that there is now this competition within the government between the Laker now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself is a dominant force and so\nI I can see this becoming a sort of competition between the two a governing coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take 'em Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism as one phrase used\nUm and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embraces penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit\nIs kinda macho politics isn't it absolutely it does does cloud ... of the nation how we could have a point telephones and Gemini they've gotten away with overspending and and you know exceeding their public debt limits that sets out by the EU why can't it and he just do the same it is one rule for them and one rule fits in isn't it\nIt's not to turkey and reasonable point and I think the ... there was some in the commission particularly miss miss the most could reach the a commissioner responsible for economic and financial effect who were willing to give it to the government a bit of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate the conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government the chance to\nSee ... this is disagreements with Brussels but I I think the difference I supposed to keep people here in Brussels will in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France overstepped that a budget rules they were led by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules are more willing to die that country's back onto a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and the wildly unrealistic growth expectations and there's and say this is not a government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German governments have the time when they overstepped the debt deficit limit but\nThe European Union can't afford to bailout his late ... this is this is the ultimately the big problem for actually\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this is also interact with close to the ongoing debates about reforming the yours and where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nA countries and like it's a ... but also other other countries in southern Europe ah who's the violence is weaker and who feel that there was ... years and he'd been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and then on the other hand you have moved and European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is the so called new ... leaks of this new kind of\nA ... a in Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who are who are very skeptical about any further risk sharing within the years and and that's all going to come to a crunch in mid December to sum it here in Brussels and that may well now take place against the backdrop of escalating a tit for tat between Rome and Brussels which of course we'll make compromise at that summit very difficult indeed\nJeremy cliff the economists colors and

be able to do what the report that class which is to reduce\nGreenhouse gas emissions at a rather dramatic rate compared to where we are now which is forty five percent by twenty thirty and reach carbon neutrality across the ...\nThat is a radical descent but it comes with radical benefits for all mankind okay the\nPolitical will that's required to implement it is the thing that you could argue is missing not least in the current\nGeo political situation that we see with President Trump saying he's pulling away from the Paris climate change agreement even though there are other countries who still willing to commit it's still a challenge is it not to make this possible it is still a challenge\nIf it weren't to challenge the countries would not have commissions this report we always knew that this was going to be a challenge the report is basically there to give us the numbers that we can then analyze and compare what kind of a world do we want\nAnd yes absolutely there are some national political leaders around the world right now that are completely blind both to the harm that they're bringing upon themselves and upon the world but also completely blind to the benefits that we would all rape including their national economies are in fact perhaps even\nEspecially their national economy's\nSo you know it's about blindness is not about do you believe in climate change no this is about these are the facts nobody asks you do you believe in crotchety right whether you believe in gravity or not gravitational pull actually has an effect on your body so this is not ideology this is not fiction this is not a mess\nThis is facts this scientific assessment of what the two worlds are that we are being faced with and sooner or later everyone is going to have to wake up to the collective responsibility of ensuring that we all moved towards the better world and not to the way worse world but\nWe certainly know what's happened to the way in which facts are interpreted or even at the way in which facts all presented so ideologically there is an outfield battle in terms of the way in which the United states under President Trump is framing the conversation\nYes and that is really the tragedy the fact that this has descended into ideology is really nothing short of pathetic and completely irresponsible because it is not an ideological discussion about what kind of a world do we want to inherit toward children and our grandchildren\nWill do individuals need to do because clearly this isn't just about political will there is a huge amounts that individuals can do if they do it either by themselves all on math and then it becomes a collective shift\nAnd exactly so for things that we can all do I actually quite quickly out first give up meat because the production of animals leads in many ways to climate change into greenhouse gas emissions\nSecondly transport be much more aware of how your transporting yourself from point a to point B. if there's public transferred available to use it if you're going to walk or bike much better for your health transport is a huge\nEmitter of greenhouse gases and we all need to make a better\nJob at that thirdly those who have investments and I realize that it's not everyone around the world\nBut those who have investments have huge responsibility to ensure\nThat invested capital is actually\nSupporting the growth of technologies and corporations that are producing low carbon products and services and not the opposite way around and then of course we come back to politics how

twenty eleven well Lucy Williamson has been covering the trough Ross in Madrid and joins us live now from there tell us more about the costs decision that Lucy\nWas it was a strange kind of a topic today I'm at what is that it was found to have taken in as much as they got it from her mother straight off the hub us in Nineteen sixty nine he was found her foolish type of scientific it and was found to have given her to another couple as a gift\nBut the court also decided that too much time had pause to actually convict him that the statute of limitations in this case only extended to ten years off to the child in his turned Eighteen and of course this was some forty nine years ago now since ... walked free\nWe spoke to and it's often the verdict she had mixed feelings about it she told us that she would appeal the verdict but that she was happy the truth had been officially established him I think there'll be a and\nI think they'll be able to get when they went out and I feel good because the Spanish ... yes maybe have been stone in Spain and also that mother wasn't lying she always told the truth\nI don't mind that he's not going to jail it's not the most important thing because he can't leave his house people will recognize him and everyone knows who the gate\nAnd he's condemned anyway now the second phase stop getting to the Supreme Court and let's see what they decide on the statute of limitations\nReaction there in his mouth or gal Lacey one woman one snatched baby them one doctor in this case but this has always thoughts are much much wider war is the reaction been women around the country have their babies taken away\nYes exactly this is a case between one doctor and one woman who he helps deliver forty nine years ago but it's been watched across the country and the reason is that it's not really just about confronting in his his history this is about\nOpening up a really difficult chapter of Spain's paused at least that's how the campaign to see a dark part of Spain's history\nAccording to the campaign has had perhaps tens of thousands of mothers had that baby stolen in the post war years\nLike in his his mother by medical stuff for members of the Catholic Church mostly because they were judged on ... to raise that children either they were seen as political opponents opposed to general Franco's dictatorship\nOr in later years it was because they were a marriage or simply judge to pool\nLater on in the Nineteen seventies and eighties company to say it saved it became a master of trafficking the children for money but this was the first trial of anyone actually involved in those alleged practices and there's a small group of mothers outside court today wasting for the verdict some of them said they were angry that joke today\nDescribed it as a slap in the face but there were others that were happy the state had knowledge this for the very first time\nWe spoke to one mother power to an end as whose baby was taken away by a nun in Nineteen Seventy four before pilot could even give us the spoon child name she told me oh even learn it's gender\nImmediately after the but she said she was injected with a drug that left to unconscious the following day and ... the baby had died when palate demanded to know what had happened that talked to said it was an active goats\nWhen she also the the puppy she was told it had already been buried\nForty four years later talking to us she still cries at the source of the child she never got a chance to hold\nOn you know but we're not got done if you're going to be thrown away\nOn the day he still had to stay I tend to I say you and nine semi badly enough chain ... by their I've let you as I say we face child but I was from the time he says it will tell you you know simple\nLots Paulos story a Lucy I was just one story one case will be more\nI think that's the first thing people are waiting for now is to see what things Supreme Court makes if this appeal and what they say about the legal time limit for trials of this kind that's always going to affect\nUm how many trials of approaching the future that have been thousands of complaints we understand but a lot of them are very difficult to follow up because it's so difficult decades later to find the evidence that prosecutors need to really bring a solid case\nI mean it's up to vet a himself is believed to has destroyed evidence releasing to the case he was tried and of course many of those involved and now very elderly\nAnd innocence adults you know that in fact confessed the situation to her before she died but because because she was handed and it's it's a baby and mother of course had no idea who the biological parent was\n... is the man he can tell how but despite this landmark trial in is it still may place at the finding out who had the mother is or even if she's still alive\nLucy thanks very much the BBC's Lucy Williams some back in Madrid and if you go to the BBC website BBC don't come

providing a lead how much difference cannot make\nWell it makes a long term difference but I'll tell you I a lot of people in our country a feeling like the federal government is letting us down than not following the science and not following the law they're trying to roll everything back but frankly they're not that good at it\nAnd so I feel confident that the rules will stay in place but it's a longer term signal that you want to send you know this isn't a short term problem this is that this is a a challenge where we have the solutions today which is why on mayors and governors and why the business sector is really motivated to act\nBecause in the absence of federal leadership we can still do a lot of things at those other levels and in the business sector but it's that long term investment that we're not seeing\nOne of the things you talked about just marriage jobs on yeah it's been the arguments of the current president and his administration that actually jobs on the line because of some of the decisions that were taken to get rid of coal and gas how do you argue against that\nYou probably look at facts which this administration sometimes doesn't look that closely you know the facts are that clean energy is winning in the marketplace that's where the job growth is it is not in the old fossil fuel sectors\nWe see clean energy taking off in the United states and it continues to move at a pace that's faster than we ever intended that doesn't mean we're nearing any finish line but this administration doesn't understand\nTo make what they call America great again by looking backwards\nClearly one of the the way that individuals can change their carbon footprint is the type of comedy Dr Americans love cause and it's and it's proved very difficult to get America change their habits\nWe had to actually regulate not to get our car companies to sell fuel efficient vehicles that Americans actually wanted to buy\nWhich is one of the reasons they were going bankrupt when President Obama came in he rescued then we we actually work with them we settle long term strategy and they've been doing well ever since mostly record breaking years they're they're adding jobs\nThey're selling cars that people want to buy and they're saving consumes money as a result if you want to revert to really extensive fuel efficient vehicles that doesn't save consumers anything at the pomp\nAnd it also doesn't save lives by cleaning up our air pollution today in addressing the challenge of climate change for all of\nUs to talk about saving lives look at some of the the extreme weather that America seems to be having to to deal with more and more I mean is that having an impact do things on the white people look at the climate\nI Believe that it is which is why people know what's happening but we haven't yet turned from talking about how bad climate is to make the change to talking about what what is a a a future that we all want to move towards\nWe have to think about this a little bit smarter and instead of focusing so much on the bad let's talk about the opportunities\nLet's talk about how many lives saved if we move towards cleaner cars let's talk about how when you don't burn coal you don't spill mercury into our atmosphere that's an or a toxin ... kids\nLet's talk about the contagious diseases that are moving in a changing climate to places where we've never had them before or the drought we're facing\nLet's talk about the opportunities we have to lift everybody up and moved to a future that's better for everyone I feel like we're fighting about nothing instead of grabbing the future in running towards\nAnd this report would it make any difference to the conversation in the United states even going to just be seen as another more of the same that washes over people's heads\nI don't think people have grabbed climate change because I think they think it's a problem for the planet instead of the people that live on the planet I'm hoping that this will reignite a conversation but that conversation will turn from oh woe is me and how afraid MRI\nTo what the opportunities of future can be\nI was Gina McCarthy former
