forces treaty was America had on a date Russia has denied us claims that it's broken the agreement\nSo what exactly was this particular treated designed to do Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that's a U.S based known policy is an organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nThe INS treaty was negotiated by president Ronald Reagan and Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was it was concluded in Nineteen eighty seven and it requires that the United states and Russia eliminate and prominently for where\nAll of their ground launched missiles with ranges between\nFive hundred and five thousand five hundred kilometers\nSo that eliminate an entire class of nuclear arms missiles in Europe that were particularly destabilizing and this has been a key fixture in the U.S Russian arms control architecture\nEver since and to this day uh you know us NATO allies has made it clear they see the IMF treaty as a pillar of European\nSecurity the American view now is the Moscow had repeatedly violated while America had on a date [noise]\nWell the United states beginning in two dozen fourteen alleged and I believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles\nProbably somewhere in central Russia off and on efforts through diplomacy to\nConfront Russia about this demand that they return to compliance were unsuccessful but I think the diplomatic options to deal with it so clearly knocked down exhausted there was only one needy\nIn the past year between us and Russian officials to discuss\nThe matter and so yes Russia has violated the treaty but the question is does us withdraw makes sense from a security standpoint doesn't bring Russia back into compliance when I think it does\nBut I was gonna say let me put the question back to you what are the implications of the U.S withdrawal in your view [noise]\nWell one implication is that the existing constraints on us and Russian deployment of the intermediate range systems could very soon be gone\nSo Russia could expand the relatively small number of these non compliant missiles which are called the nine and seven to nine\nIn much greater numbers meanwhile the United states does not have any ground launched cruise missile forward deployments\nAt all so it may be morally satisfying for President Trump to pull out of this treaty because of frustration over Russia's failure to respond to our calls for it to return to compliance but it doesn't help address the underlying\nProblem what would you expect the law\nWe need to think this through and make sure that whatever it is worth doing or doing in a coordinated way but look I think that uh he himself personally would be dealt with in a very severe way\nTo that extent do you think western governments weapon ... too quick to embrace crown prince Mohammed bin so nine and a wrong to believe that he was a reformist you know if\nYou sit with any of the very impressive individual when he talks about the future of the country and\nPrivatizing aramco and diversifying into other areas and making sure that country's future is not just focus on fossil fuels but diversifying to take care of the main to future generations or\nHis willingness to take on the the most fundamental harvest and the country to do some progressive things and they happen both for human rights and other reason so if you listen to those things he's very impressive\nBut then if you watch and he's made a number of rookie mistakes I mean what he dead end cutter and the way that it without communicating to other countries was no doubt a rookie mistake what he did and arresting the prime minister of Lebanon and bringing them back a Saudi Arabia no doubt was a rookie mistake\nAnd in the order of this which it would appear that he may have done certainly this is goes beyond\nBeing absolutely ruthless we know of what he did at the Ritz Carlton where I detained opposition folks shut them down torture some of them and so I think we just need to understand that hood as we're dealing with and what is tendencies have banned\nAnd now that this kind of activity could continue on for many many years and collectively we've got to figure out a way of having a policy to deal with it that gets to an outcome that is good for the world if you will\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker speaking to my colleague Julian Marshall\nNow the last two years millions of Venezuelans have

extensively by the time I pick it up and read it what are you trying to what you're trying to say and do\nWell that's more of a sketch I ... a red light\nAnd say it's all sort of reflective vigil stories are coming out of people you yeah which I think it's a nice a nice touch you Kevin you find that people haven't found\nAnd I mean you have to make it likely that people are wondering because you're quite right by the by that time effort nice ... yesterday you know when you haven't brought on something like that it's not as they were saying it's revelation unless something in the ...\nAnd ... and you're covering it from that and science say so yes it is much more of a sketch and and that's quite fun to write but it doesn't mean I'm trying to follow him you'll find Asimov sending in

pulled the Russians Daryl Kimball is the executive director of the arms control association that is a U.S based known parties on organization which promotes public understanding of arms control policies\nWhile the United states beginning in two thousand fourteen alleged in I Believe it's correct that Russia tested a ground launch cruise missile beyond the five hundred kilometer range limit allowed by the treaty and began to deploy a small number of these missiles\nProbably somewhere in central Russia off and on efforts through diplomacy to\nConfront Russia about the demand that they return to clients were unsuccessful but I think the diplomatic options to deal with is clearly not been exhausted there was only one needy in the past year between us and Russian officials to discuss\nThe matter and so yes Russia has violated the treaty but the question is does us withdraw makes sense from a security standpoint doesn't bring Russia back into compliance by ... think it does\nWell one of the things he Britain leaving me is that we and our I'm willing to skate or other like set we have our without yeah I mean at somebody like that to somebody in midlife crisis meaning leaving that reliable and ... and getting in finding said this old days out there\nAre more dangerous friends and I think I'm willing to cross laptops come ... safety ... tales of leaving the biggest markets in the wild\nAbsolutely I mean the ultimate question is how much does Britain or any other country want to be the policemen of the world is this a role in or is that is that to global responsibility and when we say global that includes Russia and China who work on the church is different set of values than we in the west\nOperate on what though if more images I mean clearly there is talk of more evidence emerging from to keep 'em if some reports a right to some of that evidence could be extremely gruesome would that change things\nWill murder Israel was gruesome regardless of how he takes face um and I think the Turks have been politicizing the way they've been dropping and dripping information and then saying don't don't take this ... authorized leaks so important to look\nAt a at the whole thing in context social she was murdered and he was a as a Saudi Arabia has said was murdered by at least senior officials\nAnd on and I think we just have to wait for the results of the investigation bugs toddlers and how's the world would react to it\nAnd of course named him for that when we knew what was happening in Yemen they will still gathering at very happening what what do you think about that\nWell I mean the Yemen crisis is is is another one you've got it it it's not the subject so frightening there it's Iran with who says if the straits of a of a moderate in the south is Red Sea all closed at Fifteen Percent of global trade goes through the straits that means massive inflation that's going to affect us\nAll goes through there it's it's ... you could argue that Saudis actually fighting the war of the west of war because of the south is news and the Iranians close the straits it's us in the west who would be having to pay the price for its\nOne of the things we're told about why the west supports the Saudi regime is this\nBold step of not propping up the Saudi regime will I mean that's what's happened in two thousand and three with Iraq and that led to the creation of false us we're still dealing with that I think it will be much worse if the same thing is repeated with Saudi\nBecause it's not as soon as the extremists who wouldn't exploit this but strikes treatments than done on do you have and then you've got the oil um we have to be a political and economic repercussions that will take many many years even longer than the Iraq War repercussions from steel which will still dealing with no\nThank you very much into becoming mothers are actually somebody as we look ahead to that event in Saudi Arabia this week

mostly written in the U.S during the last\nPresidential campaign there when Madeleine came in she told me how the political debates at the time left that mark on that album\nYeah I Am willing you know some line and try to some guy\nSons I reckon\nIn early two thousand sixteen we started doing smaller venues and little clubs around the United states\nThroughout the primaries and caucuses 'em and various debates and the ins and outs of the day to day news that I felt was worth addressing a little bit in our shows just so that I could introduce a song and say\nThis is dedicated to anyone who's not represent doesn't feel represented by the government and then to the song and we'd get laughs in some places in in other places would get like\nAn angry as years but the state of our shows just felt the atmosphere of of politics was unavoidable and different from any that you've experienced before a little bit I mean the fact that the news\nInvades our lives in a way that it didn't few years ago and certainly not Twenty years ago when I started doing these little clubs and things like that and yeah so I just started to feel like it would be great if\nSome of the stuff we could talk about it instead of just trying to find a clever introduction to a song and simultaneously Larry kind who I've worked with many times over the years had just started by saying you know let's come over here and let's try this thing where we all sit in a room together five of us and\nSo this was a group of of musicians have rights as all collaborating effectively yeah or even to go out and saying yeah\nYou know hang hang hang my time on the phone line so\nUm my you know um\nI mean one thing that struck me because I Know there was one particular review that Iraq which talked about I think I don't know whether it was your comment or somebody a alongside you talking about the danger of being I think the word was pre ... ... and it's a difficult balance isn't it because you want people to enjoy the music and the lyrics with it\nBut if they don't necessarily agree with the sentiments it gets more difficult [noise] yeah but I think even beyond that it's just not artistic to stand up and say you know here's what I think and you should agree with me\nYou know I've got the podium because he ... paid to come and see the show or whatever it is that they gave you this audience it's so presumptuous to think that people want to be told what's right but it's far more artistic to ask a question and it's more\nFair and it's just more right no birds they\nName and the ... de\nDo Mm no not again\nI heard them say\nNo do home what his pen doing\nThey're meant to tells personal stories and uh that each one of these stories is you know these are meant to be such a sort of like life\nLife experience type stories down on me where you just can't get out of a circle of\nDebt or find some kind of financial ruin that might have just happened by accident you don't really know so yeah these are all stories that I think are most relevant to my experience of America is and their stories that I I think I intended to\nAt least for the most part said hey let's let's talk about this
