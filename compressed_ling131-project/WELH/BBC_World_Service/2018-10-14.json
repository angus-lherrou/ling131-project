[noise] I've heard different um what I remember but my point is they told me to love\nAnd you haven't seen them since ... when I was five years old how did you lose contact\nAll his money in a war country like uh last time my daughter was killed and my mom was well\nYou have a brother yeah and you at that age looking off to him\nYeah and he was two years old of going to do as a baby on the most important was finding food nothing else we will leave to survive we don't leave to see the future we'll have to survive you've lost contact will happen\nIt was very difficult to some points and I decided to find the friends of my dodge way we used to go out to hung around with my dad so I went I left my bravo with them and I didn't tell them my house I plan to go somewhere else\nSo you were separated from your brother at the age of six yes he was to ... and up until very recently you haven't seen him again a tool you had no knowledge that he was still alive\nYeah um for some reason I had I had to hope I say he is strong enough you will survive if you know strong like the way I struggle he'll be day to because a little skewed died before hunger food and stuff like that and\nYeah I Know there's been a miracle of\nYeah it's hot enough to our state nine nine news and I look at him again it was kind of\nMiracle on him seeing me doesn't recognize me he said I don't know that guy\nHow do you know this is your brother or somebody just contacted me because I'm I was trying to stay away a lot of 'em on the social media and stuff but not post myself because when I I I'd be [laughter]\nI got my professional contract football and a lot of people ... stop posting pictures I said when I was six years old I lost my ... this country and if anybody finding mile give him this amount of money and stuff like that there is a these will be available and then there is so many people contact me for different kids\nAnd then finally there is one password and who may shed and my mother's name correctly so I said he might be they want so we arrange to do the DNA test and then we did it they can sense yeah it was confirmed what how many ... um it's\nCold like up to and said my opponent was cold and it was like okay this is not true false\nI didn't believe the second thing what I did is to get a flight the next day well we'll see he was look at it in Uganda Kampala other strict cute as well and he's managed to bring him to lump\nYes she is here with me and he's living with me now so we'll have like after all this time [noise]\nVery nice feelings like there are very nice or this is the family that I was waiting for a long time\nAnd they've not even being living together for a week it was six days ago the um it moved in to it smells so he was a truly inspirational young man up with me in the studio rubbed ... and Ron I'm Michelle I'm ...\nYou can probably identify with that story because you were an undocumented immigrant\nI'm absolutely I left Liberia when I was six years old I'm moved to the United states to drawing my mother and my father\nAnd pretty much overstayed my visa and lived in undocumented man limbo from the time I was six until I was about Twenty years old so hearing that story what it really says to me is you know this sort of\nRacist than a phobic populist notions that are migrants are um a purge on society that they are swarm who come in and feed off the system finite resources for those who are not documented\nUm who are documented I should say is a complete mess um this young man is a is emblematic of the sheer resilience and the great and the hard work\nThat migrants put in a minute from come from very difficult circumstances not for me I left Liberia before the war started but as a result of the war I had to remain in the United states and my parents showed me for almost fourteen years from that fourteen year armed conflict\nUm and as a result of that my parents had to work exceedingly hard um to pay for very exorbitant immigration fees to send me to private schools because public schools as too much questions about my status\nUm and so I think listening to this story should make a lot of us rethink our notions about migrants whether they be documented or undocumented that they actually contribute meaningfully to society um and that many of them come through very safe orderly in regular manners\nYeah he is achieved so much I mean so much more than most people would achieve and the whole large already and unease barely getting started run and what did you make of that type\nI thought I mean ... it was an absolute inspiring story and in many ways very useful at this global moment when it seems that migration is almost always associated in news headlines with negative stories stories about\nThe exploitation or stories that migrants simply take away jobs from indigenous populations are which are of dislike self contradictory stories they come to be true at once\nAnd I think hearing it smells story reminds us then science we're not talking about a zero sum when migrants joined the community we're talking about a new contribution where the parts are more than the sum of\nThe whole this particular story actually I think is interesting because of course he's gone on to imperial college London He's studying science and technology what are the areas where the country we're sitting the United kingdom desperately needs to develop new specialization news skill set in those terms it's very clear that smell and his brother I guess a contributing to something that this country really needs\nIs smell

she said this is not the green policy of you know you're officially the foreign minister from ten years ago the rather sort of ... this is the role of the more radical fundamentalism type of green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually it's often just with a different place the Green Party they have two very charismatic leaders are they've gone and they worked very hard\nOn them they're they're at their\nPro you know there are anti racist I mean and they're part of a large movement in Germany I mean there was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday\nTo uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people turn up and two hundred and forty thousand people turned up\nSo they're they're pro tolerance or pro environment you know ... uh you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people are are more interested in that kind of humane politics I've also heard people say you know at that mean that they see us you've had for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they missed the humane policy and politics that used to be and not those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it there's a migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\nAnd well it's because that migration has since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country\nIs divided the way people think there are a lot of people who don't want people coming in to people who are doing very well particularly pensioners this is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money so to speak [noise]\nThey're also worried about loss of\nAnd their their sense of ... you know their culture they're afraid at part of the thing that the ... say they're against and immigration particularly from Islamic countries and that this is a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh\nThe flavor on the color on the sense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope Cho\nJust looking back to that report from James ... from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows just sticking with the topic of immigration that's the last speaker was junk to know the founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas you grew up in the United states as a migrant well she'll take on that I\nDid I thought it was particularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrants I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls in detention to ensure that those people from across\nIn Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more climbed a sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers so you're essentially what you're doing is you're giving smugglers and people who engage\nAnd an income um and and you're creating an opportunity for migrants to some to be more danger um so I just I just found that it was quite interesting that this you know I'm Latino Republican so harsh\nAbout migrants coming from from Mexico when in actuality that's the same rhetoric the same race is sort of xenophobia grabbing rhetoric that Donald Trump has enabled across across the United states I I don't know why this happened\nBecause you you'll rush I've heard this perspective before why would someone with it you would have ... an understanding of the issues that immigrants face what why would they moved to that ... I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a you know notions across the globe have done a fund I had made a fundamental impact on how people see the U.S and us and them\nKind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states um tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because he is ... you know there's this find not set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who looked like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can't have migraine ... which for me it's very warm psychologically but that's that's the way of the world\nAround them is it your professor of history and politics of\nModern China just how big an issue is immigration and China\nWill the really big issue there is no immigration in the sense of people from outside China coming in but in terms of migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nEssentially moved from their home villages throughout China to build you know buildings were on high speed railways and essentially provide the labor back to China but those people were not properly documented they can't claim for welfare pensioner education rights\nFor their children and that's where the single biggest problem facing shines today the question of poor people wanted to move to where the money is\nThe city's weekend from the BBC well service with me I like Fritz ... German his foot bowling side has continued they've lost free now to the Netherlands that six defeats in ten games I looked at Ross joins me from ...\nHow much pressure is that for a change of mine at ya how you ask a question of first defeats the metal and since Nineteen Ninety two first time ever that Germany I've gone three games without scoring that bought some of that three team European nations lake with to match is to go I'm facing a trip to world champions from snakes so\nGiven this all comes off they finished Baltimore that group of the world cup of coffee angry and very public international retirement of ...\nDespite the fact that he's won the world cup on a confederation scalp and his twelve years in charge manager at your your love knows the pressure to perform is growing\nVoluntarily just see if we thought it was the heart and disappointing match to lose three mill in the first few minutes we have control and created a few chances are biggest problem is we're not taking them the situations that word wedding training didn't work in the matches disappointing the way we played in the last ten minutes when we can see the two goals\nAt this level that I shouldn't have chosen amount of hours in the first thing\nThat was the big match in Europe on Saturday and the Africa Cup of nations qualifiers and ball boys to one way in the Congo amount of gas cars will know when a white ... Ecuadorian guinea provided the shocks well much area and South Africa both both posted it very big wins\nThey put themselves in prime position now to be the two sides to qualify from groups\nPay and intent of should we be surprised that Roger Federer has failed to make the final a Shanghai group and I think a lot of people will be surprised at Roger Federer\nBut a month ago so in that sense perhaps not but being in the semi final against the Twenty one year old who never reached the final Adam office event default federal was all basically going to be the favorite in the end up on a charge\nPosted I surprised six ... six fall when he spoke to his final place against ... but federal they still happy with how he's performed in Shanghai\nI'm happy or the body is held this week I feel like I'm explosive out there I'm returning well I'm showing the middle I think it's OK could be even a little bit better um I don't think that played a match where I didn't get broken so that's something\nThat it's more unusual for me but um this week I felt like I was hitting the ball well and I think that's something that I can take along with me\nOn that final charge against jock itch gets underway in around two hours type\nAlistair Ross thank you very much you're listening to weekends from the b._b._c.

I'm\nSorry I think ... little cut off here\nYeah it it it's not the best I I I was a question for all of you um and in fact rubbed do\nWe have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of United States the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world does it work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think there's a small cabal of very small\nGroup of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer pricing or less the financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment I think those will serve as the parents\nOption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe so that people really face the full weight of the long\nRun up and I think it's very important that liberal governments exercise that kind of transparency and the anti corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the\nUh the waterfront countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways of cracking down on corruption a more effective and the liberal will have to have an answer to that\nWe're having all sorts of trouble with the ... and a half to say goodbye to our friends from Amnesty International guard thought of as a newspaper article written that you've written a in front of me here and this is well this is corruption automate just go buy a movie star in China just tell me a ...\nIt's in this morning's London Sunday Times and it's basically about funding being the single most famous movie style celebrity in China sixty million followers on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter and she said she disappeared in July reappeared on E. three months later and very mysterious circumstances with the tax bill\nFor a hundred and twenty nine million US dollars which is almost as high as a BBC present the salary I Believe yeah but I ...

politics of Martin China and runner I go to copy of today's Sunday Times newspaper here with me and he writes about the corruption charges against the Interpol president in China [laughter]\nThat's right and many will know that he was arrested last week in Beijing and has now been put up on bribery charges in China but it's part of a much bigger story which is a crackdown by Xi Jinping the Chinese leader and his Communist Party government on not just corruption but actually political opposition as well so the two things come together\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting phenomenon which is really big in China the growth of alteration intelligence ... so\nThe state is using tech for surveillance in China\nMuch more than any other governments in the world you might say\nIt's almost a kind of trial run for a soldier surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards and on those not just the financial details or your rent a criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's a real social change happening in China this\nAnti corruption stories just one positive\nBecause I read an extraordinary thing on the news was yesterday and this was the the the the software that is in in the hands of the Chinese state was going to be used to target the credit rating to lower the credit rating of anyone found smoking in public\nThat's right it's what's called social credit in other words if you do things the criminal but or in some ways against public morals can be crossing the road at the wrong place almost seriously of course criticizing the government that will be on the record and you might find that for instance you turn up at the railway station you went by rail ticket\nAnd you'll ID card says sorry you don't have enough social credit points to actually do that it's a completely new way of controlling the population and it's going to get bigger and bigger\nRoped into you mentioned earlier in the program about your research on race based immigration in some West African countries how much debate you see about this in the country is concerned\nWell it's race based citizenship clause that so the countries Liberia and Sierra Leone which I'm we're formally\nUm slave sort of a slave history with those two countries where former on many minutes it slates from the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have re citizenship clauses that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and Sierra Leone\nUm and what's fascinating for me about this historically is that you know the Westphalia and systems says uh or or sort of use whiteness as a reference for citizenship white and it's a male and it says a reference for citizenship but what these countries are effectively doing and you can debate whether or not it's right or wrong is that they're\nCentering blackness as a reference for citizenship for me this is incredibly revolutionary\nBecause it basically states you know this black lives matter movement black lives matter movement is bringing to the fore that black lives matter um and black citizenship batters and it should be the central focus point for having a discussion about us citizenship there is a debate particularly in Liberia about whether or not it's important to aggregate the clause\nDentist ethos people were crying and shouting I go down and looked at him lying there bleeding do such confusion no one knew what to do\nIs killers have never been brought to justice protected by an amnesty ... off of eight Nineteen Ninety to peace agreement I spoke to the American journalist Jean ... in South south at all\nIt's mainly an atmosphere of great joy and celebration they're having two major celebrations tonight in different places one being the ... the jewel downtown\nWhere he gave those Sunday homily that made him so famous the other is the little chapel on the grounds of a hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while saying mass one night\nThat will be people who've never heard of Oscar Romero who is he why she's so important\nWas the archbishop appear in set titled the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twelve year civil war broke out here and he was he was really be loved\nAnd respected because he spoke out very strongly about the injustices that existed here and at that time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing his life he was shot to death the day after\nHe gave us Sunday sermon directing himself specifically to the members of the armed forces in saying to them you do not have to obey and immoral ordered to go out and and kill people\nAnd that did not go down well with some of the authorities said who killed him\nWell it was for the most part\nPeople from you know on the government side the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point\nOut that there was a growing leftist movement here to ensure the grew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war and when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed\nIf you will you make a mistake and uh\nDenouncing you for it in his homily the following Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killers of never being brought to justice why not\nWell for a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and with that the case couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court has overturned that ends the law and\nActually this week in Rome the leader of\nThe Catholic Church cardinal rules that child has has said he thinks it's really important that there be a trial because he says the wounds from the war has never healed and the only way for them really to heal is for the country to find out what the truth really was\nAbout his assassination and then for justice to be applied\n[noise] that was journalist gene Columbus speaking to me from El Salvador\nAnd the three thousand people have signed a petition opposing a plan that statue of ... county in Malawi commercial capital blanche off the ... muscle group climb now suddenly that the Indian independence or I did nothing for the southern African countries they accused him of being a racist\nJimmy Kenya teaches media and communications at the University of Malawi and told me why he backed this cool\n... had most in Malawi has no connection to our country they used to live in Africa and ended up being in the listener is that have been a few publications that are questioning his stance on Africa Africa's arguing about he was one where we have a racist\nYou had a lot of people will be quite surprised to hear this but except perspective that much in recent years what do you see evidence somehow McGahn deep being a racist [noise] when\nYou look at the relations in Malawi has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and that business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in weight as the Indian Malawi doesn't leave him ... doesn't really socialize with a list or the wider community so from my perspective there's a context to that argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in ... and as you said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise]\nHe is the point from in the government respective is more or less like how they argued in gonna win in government was forced to take your stature yet my to my gun from the rest of the argument that has been sort of cardio relationship and has been good\nA diplomatic relations between that country in India the same argument that I was being made in Malawi and here we're talking about is that you something that is\nGoing to stand in the middle or might always commercial capital wouldn't need to be a sort of sign of tolerance if you want to have this statute build a sign up not always moved on\n... you could argue from a perspective but then when they begin to think about what a structure stunts voice completely different thing by housing starts are basically you're attending feature demolition of the ... that is somebody that I Do my ... it'd be\nSo if not Mahatma Gandhi who would you like to have a statue of\n... so it's good for for me just to name one pill is on but I think it would I Would do something about them and started ... were fired Joe ... who is one of those pardon the eyes of an phone you're struggling this country he had to British national didn't take\nYes but this is actually happening ... subtitled struggled people are struggling ... points out maybe pretty much every country that I'd have to do something but it wouldn't be so I was looking for something\nTo me Ken yeah from the University of Malawi statues are a bunch of things some say I'm Brooke ... absolutely I think\nThe outgrowth of a de colonization pan African is moving across the continent where people are looking at colonial structures be they buildings or names of streets\nI'm fly the line just recently changes names that flood teeny to go back to the indigenous name 'em and even the rose must fall movement at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it pits that make violence um whereas you know racist policies across the university\nNeeded to move this uh the statue of subtle Rhodes who's a sinister colonialist um across the southern African region so I think\nIt it's it's a bigger kind of conversation that's happening across the continent in academics basis but also at national level\nRather you are listening to that to what did you make of it\nWell first of all I Hope that uh the the speaker is what's going to campaign to have the name of the city of ... change 'cause I think that's an alternate ditched his name but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagree with his position\nThe first one is that he said that Gandhi has nothing to do with Africa in fact ... having spent large parts of his life in South Africa\nAcross the whole of Africa in Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere Indian communities would deeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress of course very closely involved with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that was gone these great contribution to independence movements the idea of mass\nNon violence in our current terribly violent era I think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course it on a dumpy had some reprehensible views when he was younger he moved complete it goes against those when he was older\nAnd rejected cost racism and so forth so understanding how the ... developed means that they're not saying that human beings who deserve respect and gum has much to say Africa as great African leaders like Monday law have to the entire world\n[noise] it's interesting though how one person can be viewed differently in two different places ten seconds each\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know I hear the the points that are taken I think the the concerns across Malawi are um are valid again coming out of the colonial sort of an African is anti racist movement um but yes you're you're absolutely right that that's the power perspective isn't it\nRonald ten seconds really I Would say the ... and ... should be placed on around the world and plenty of others he gets to\nThe final word run a ... a professor of history and
