to be around point ... percent in the third quarter very similar to the thing is we had in the second quarter\nBut within that they will be major differences and perhaps the biggest one\nWill be from France has been struggling for two or three calls is now largely because of higher energy prices and squeezes own household incomes but by the third quarter when residential taxes have been reduced and underlying wages of\nBeing picking up we should see quite a big uplift immigration numbers from so within this very stable ... picture that may be better news from so many other economies\nWhen economists they're looking at these numbers and they're saying you know Europe is growing and it's growing steadily and his ... point ... percent GDP Growth coming through that's pretty pathetic compared with almost anywhere else in the world and they're not just talking about China will some of the fast growing African economies compared with the United states everybody else\nIs but the last

probably not going to be very different from the second quarter something of their own point one point to Italy is still struggling and the defense budget proposals for next year come through that growth rate might pick\nUp a bit but it's nowhere near as boy in Spain for example is growing by that point six percent a cool to have the the Italian attempt to give\nThe underlying grave members a bit of a boost because of the budget proposals for next year it's still pretty unlikely that they will be able to grow the medium to any higher than the woman one and a half percent that they've

individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n[noise]\nIn the u._k. the full separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers of colleagues Oxford University shed the independent commission on banking set up by the u._k. government following the crisis I asked him whether this has made banking safer\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions\nDoing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on the lives frowns then the second heading was how to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses\nIf we're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cooled ring fencing so this is the idea\nThe ordering high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped as cool things which we all as individuals and small businesses depend on which the government can't let for life without titled calamity\nThat those activities in major banks\nShould be in a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposure to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperiled domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some jeopardy so that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the adoption of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentrated in fewer hands in the u._k. is in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bailout the ailing banks and too sweet and the terms of a much bigger banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks go even bigger and competition was reduced\nThe big banks are not too big to fail and if they collapsed that would bring down the whole system this implies that governments which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's enough to have ... of the bankers' new clothes\nSize of the largest banks certainly grow\nThat will tell you that they did the favor swallowing that ... that there's really nothing natural nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in lock it they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they had the privileged existence why they keep getting\nFunding despite being sold risky insult pay\nTheir too many privilege until many subsidies that come along with the status of being sort of that big\nWith you because they know you can't default on your lungs\nAre you off to where the measures to prevent the mix financial crisis have improved matches or made them was\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been their first response you know quick solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nGrowing complexity and into dependency of the banking system was facilitated by revolution reached technological changes such as growing computer power\nWhich allowed physics and math graduates to build financial products which the top bosses let alone the regulators politicians and customers do not understand\nFar from reducing and offsetting risk innovations we're raising and spreading it\nI think we were told that all these innovation that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about\nClever ways to hide their asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily is for for society so yeah at some level you you want it functioning financial system and the financial system can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it's it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy it was spent in justifying things that are not that great and in a void in discussion of all day\nSubtle ways some times in which the public was deceived do miss sold and older misconduct that goes on in this industry\n[noise] as the pace of technological change has accelerated this concern

Australia and Kenny ... from Nigeria so your booth operating at a level where many of the artist you worked with on huge big names and know exactly what they want\nTo think came in specific examples where you had to navigate accommodating to sing holding on to create a vision and I knew him and you say that you had a hundred percent success rate but they must have been certain points with somebody when something a little bit different they say just and does has yeah\nYou got to understand initially in the beginning it wasn't this way because I mean I have to put myself in especially being a woman in the industry and competing with of course jumps doing to men because it is a male dominated field and that ... the editor cross all starting off\nOn television so I was a pretty person that now want it to to be the girl with the camera so it was an obstacle that I needed to jump over to change people's minds and the only way I could do that only weapon I had\nWas every time you get the opportunity you have to knock it out the park the first ever project that I did one official project and I did music video was a music video for an award ceremony at I was one of those\nAnd they had a a song that was going to be the theme song on and they had a lot of the big names pitching for it\nAnd I'm like you know what do you do not like you know I'm the director now and it's like yeah I mean this is what we want you to start when you come out of the stage and things like that and I mean I'm not just one thing I had one day I had a dream about the concept tries to be as visual as possible\nAnd I sent it to the guy that you know it was running the show and he called me like I was like actually love this treatment and bite off you are like that in the\nI call with this one and I need to make a decision as I pointed and I said you know what how 'bout you do this\nHow about you don't pay me\nGave me just what I Need to execute this project and you get a better deal because of course you're gonna have to pay these big name just give me what I Need to execute this project so at that point I caught that Charles eventually\nTo position myself and it wasn't heritage that I knocked it out the part I might not have gotten a lot more boosted tuition but that is the only part of an effort to pitch for it\nBut then once I was able to deliver it wasn't always like a business card to universe and a lot of people call me they don't even though I'm a girl so [laughter] because it just be the music video and like I Want that person and and that's just how it's been\nLike I can talk about how much you're charging [laughter] I'm very expensive very kind you never know how they ... you don't have to give me the exact figure to give me a sense of how much you're charging a fence it depends on the project\nThat things I charge denied that things are charging all is a ... ... they're probably like I'll give you their projects that I Do for nothing at all\nThat but I made me the most money when they came to me my budget was a little bit too much for them I really love the project I wanted to be parts of it I thought it was something that I needed to be involved in that particular project might not have\nLied my pocket at that point in time when I was probably make me the most money down the line because people have seen that and gone I needed to work in this project\nRight for them when it's an effort is going to be given today I mean what they can get at you and let's go now I mean I can you give me a sense of how much she challenging\nAnd it's funny because actually my family has not increased [laughter] because there's a rule of thumb that older actors get temp Senate budget\nIs what would be typical budget I mean can give me an example of the budget or we took him out of hand hundred thousand us donors are we talking about ten thousand US dollars it can be either\nIs around ten thousand and that means that direct to get a thousand dollars but that would be like a month's work so you would get more working at a supermarket [laughter] because\nAs a matter of hours you put into a project where you drop everything and literally just do that you're not making much per hour but if you're working on a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand dollar project you can you end up with a little bit of cash in your pocket\nWhen you see the dynamics tempted then what does that mean I tend to send the total budget so who gets the budget well normally the budget comes from the label\nIn your experience how a male and female artist treated differently by their record labels\nWell in my experience and is obviously general conversation doesn't apply to everybody of ways but it really depends on the artist and like how much they already have to bring to the table but if it's somebody who has\nTo be young and like a little bit lost and not the shore and that stupid talented and have an amazing voice and maybe the songwriting needs a little bit of collaboration with other writers so it it it you know that's when the label get really involved and I've noticed that it definitely happens a lot more women

momentous decision overturning the international tradition of immunity for former heads of state\nBut Patrick had already begun pushing a different idea an exception on the grounds of Pinochet's ill

more than a hundred and eighty people playing disappeared into the sea shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital Jakarta and a search and rescue effort is now under way up and speaking to our correspondent ...\nAnd the last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out long ah which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat to be such an rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point\nThey still haven't found any survive as they both are sent helicopters to scour the seas\nIn the nearby areas to look for any people\nCharisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue\n... says to the cause of the crash\nWell it's kind of what they do say is that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crash some thirty to forty meat is into\nThe sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I\nTo add but what he's been able to analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the washer it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had to struggle to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon enough to take off\nThat's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though\nIs that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened encouragement give us an idea what do we know about line air and there are safety records\nWell lion air is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of a lion air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been ... to say the least over the last several years however aviation analyst have also said to me that\nLine has taken safety most serious the over the last few years and has invested in safety procedures and that's been a statement that come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find any survivors and to find out what happened and why this plane crashed\nAnd he had his a group of loyal voters that or only be enough to elect him congressmen\nAnd doing Thirty years he remained like this\nTo the point that when we had these car wash reparation back basically sweat to wait ... great parts of the political establishment he was one of the most vocal voices against the workers' party that was untouched by corruption\nGiving him an edge and this aura of someone that could represent a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was actually a vote for Mr both an hour or it was a vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else a vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in body the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the algae Beatty cute community and he made racist comments about slave descendants what is his presidency going to mean with all of these coming from concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were appalling remarks\nProbably from an individual who never thought that he wanted to reach were ... I Believe that the Brazilian institutions Cindy president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent that ideas like this\nAre transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible\nI believed it up hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strengths of their president legislative and judiciary system [noise]\nNow those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single really wanted better economy for Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nHe gained a lot of strength and support particularly with the president market when he chose total kid just to be his ministry of finance oh look at it as as an economist that is very respected in Brazil and he's someone who has very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring this trends and also twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that Brazil was a parliamentary system disguised as presidential new system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America so the key decisions or they go through the parliament so the key aspects to observe his relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition base\nThe the indicators that these relationship gives will give us a da da Da Nang six months for when you go because\nUh if his relationship starts to tremble a little bit to show some lack of communication then they must be concerned about the ability of\nYeah I'd I'd go at their Brazil analysts on that big win at four giant most ... the country's new president but also big challenges had [noise]\n\nCouple of years as being what feels like endless bad news about plastic pollution with pictures of slugging beaches and trucking animals going around the world\nNow some two hundred and fifty organizations including businesses accounting for twenty percent of plastic packaging produced globally assigned a commitment to get rid of the so called one used plastic in the next seven years that's plastic you one time and then just go rattles\nNow one country that has a very real interest in this case the Seychelles which relies on his blue season pristine beauty the tourists donors\nBut which is struggling with growing mountains of plastic some put you sit home much of it by those tourists and some which flights over the sea from other countries I spoke to ... vice presidents at the Seychelles weed out the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we generally think Seventy two thousand tons of waste\nAnd setting percent don't this is plastic waste so you appreciate the manager of the problem we consume plastic but we did not produce any and yet we have such a large amount of plastic we also received a large amount of the ethic as marine debris\nLending on a show is coming from other countries\nAnd other regions that is affecting a pristine beaches\nAnd also and they do not ... refund\nThis is unacceptable for the health and the cleanliness ... reefs and now the beaches in line with us to stick their image\nI I look at one recent report from the state news agency sign that said volunteers picked up one point two tons of debris on the beaches are just one island or south ... island um is this the sort of thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away something so many people depend on their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists are women they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number and you as a myriad of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S are very much part of it they are aware and conscious of the need for us to protect to a beach or\nAll sees a Walter from plastic so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nOr to support the government is doing to read a country of the of the plastic that we know ourselves for just about that lend up on our beaches\nSo there's measure that just being an ounce to get rid of this single use plastic or a plastic container say they're trying to use one since ... be recycled how much of a difference do you think that will make to you\nWhether it will make a um a lot of a difference because we we fight we bear the brunt and only if we have a twenty percent of those words in ... joined up I think it's a beginning\nIn the beginning because there's still the cheapest sent as you say you have and I made a very small steps towards sounds like a massive problem\nAverage uh begins with a very small steps we have done exactly that and we have a winning the partners like minded but those who haven't joined us and I think the effects are far reaching beyond the twin\nDeepest and to have a who have joined in and I think there is a lot for us\nTo get from those we are sure that others will joining because we all appreciate that plastic is affecting the heads of our planet we'll appreciate the fact that he does not only profit that shooting the ship humankind but also how we\nProtect the health of our planet which is the only one that we have\nHas been some maritime vice price\nIf you look on lights the loss of pictures images of\nA kind of damage plastic waste is doing to his country say show\nIt's almost at night for me and James ... on Newsday Dan Damon is here to tell us what's coming up on where they're coming up shortly on the world\nSaying well we're going to follow up on that story I'm going to talk to Ireland

what it will be is the cloud of celebrities and the blood of non celebrities in refugees in made into little cubes and then made into big cubes\nAnd put it in a steel frame and the point is that the blood is the same now you can have your own opinion on conceptual art I don't know how I feel about that I Know I think that's the point if you're ... you're supposed to feel slightly uneasy yeah it'll make you think does conceptualize it makes you think or do you think it's just\nA clumsy way of representing the bleeding obviously there's a problem and say what are you know it's it depends
