Facebook page they won't make it to any of his website to see any of these disclaimer as many won't even click a link if they see it on their own Facebook feed\nWhat they'll do is they'll just share the headline and from this perspective histories don't look any different from any other fake stories that are out there\nThat has the second like CrossFit that justifies rushing off an offensive fate nice he says that he's actually a true Democrat liberal ...\nOr ... what's known as a liberal for all\nMy purpose on line is to\nExpose the modern American conservative\nHe says he's staying as associates infiltration of right wing America to make conservatives look stupid okay you better explain that I Know it sounds weird but he's very open about the fact that he writes isn't true precisely because ... says this demonstrates that people can cherish\nWho are by and large are right wing Republican Trump supporters\n... ... plus just says this demonstrates that they up stupid or evil or malicious\n[noise]\n\nSo any say in the timeline of the story of fake news we've got to about two years ago right yeah it was tougher Blair is making money writing fake stuff Martin shank is making considerably less money debunking it but after the U.S election is suddenly a huge outpouring of attention on so called fake news\nAnd it's not long before the business model of fake news comes crashing down\nOh I Am absolutely the bad guy on the bogeyman I'm married to for many people are always will be I've accepted that the one thing that I enjoy about marriage they've always said that I

of just information\nIt's an arms race as long as there is a potential for profits people will keep trying and they will keep finding new filth of them and they will find ways to get around the filter\nAnd also stoking each other\nAnd swapping messages on line for so long question marks and finally talk with a little help from us\nI don't I'm not contending with Martin I'm contending with any of them I Hope they keep doing their jobs on um [noise] I don't know that he wants to close ... does it you know\n[laughter]\nYou're welcome to try deal I'm close to start writing\nGo no I'm much

Mike Pence stickers as well\nI Know you haven't been able to follow everything the President Trump is set in response to this particularly at a recent rally elsewhere in the country but his condemnation of what happened and all the bums being sent was for me it wasn't it\nIt does seem to be for many many at the beginning however um today he did tweet something about\nAnd has been pushing Palestinians to the curb but also it's been going its own way in the middle east and to a certain extent Europe in this way can demonstrate that it has its own interests and then we'll go its own way

to follow up for the me too era of Hollywood needs no reminding of course of the allegations faced by film producer Harvey Weinstein allegations he denies the BBC's Moffat county has been discussing these issues with Jane Fonda she began by\nAsking how she first got the idea for the film nine to five which also start Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton\nOne of my friends was an organizer of when an office workers she would tell me stories about the kinds of things that they were facing is that they had to put up with and finally one day I said I Want to make a movie about this and then was my idea to cast ...\nHow much convincing did they take a year\nTo convince ... to be in a movie which is pretty amazing given that nobody ever had Dolly at a movie before\nLooking back on the film do you think it stood the test of time\nThe issue with me too movement which began just about a year ago is very much front and center and of course nine to five very much dealt with the issues of\nSexual abuse but not just that also the fact that uh the character played by Lily Tomlin would train young men and they would be promoted past her and the salary differential those dealt with plenty of material when it comes to making a seat for children\nSexual harassment still exist the men being promoted past women still exist but now many of the workers will be\nSubcontracted which means that where do they go when their wages stolen by their boss where did they go with their fired because they're pregnant so we need a new movie whether the script will turn out I don't know I hate to get my hopes up too much\nAnd when in the wake of Harvey Weinstein in the allegations that came out about him did that present personal dynamics for you about whether to speak Kaushal knows\nNo I've never had too many difficulties speaking out\nWhat was important for me me too was the survivor's coming forward and telling their stories and being believed the time's up movement is now what are we going to do about it\nLike having more women on boards of directors having women and more positions of power\nBut right at the beginning of time's up we in Hollywood received a a wonderful letter from seven hundred thousand women farm workers you know it was really dear sisters we understand what you were talking about and rising up about we deal with it every day in the fields\nAnd it was a transformative moment and a lot of us realize that if the time's up movement is going to be successful in the long run we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters that are less visible if it's even harder for them to speak up because they will definitely lose their jobs\nI had read that do you yourself have known some of the allegations about ... percent or a cat but haven't spoken to them\nWell no you can't it's the survivor that has to speak because\nThis was before it became public that Rosanna told me her experience and the experience of other women as well and but she was too scared to come forward but she knew that it had affected her career that she had rebuffed him but I I couldn't override her and speak\nDo you think that the whole controversy around ... ... and his appointment as a Supreme Court justice do you think that that can be seen in the context of the me too movement in the sense that Christine Blasey Ford herself was willing to come forward and speak about it\nWell Anita Hill came forward and spoke about it before there was a me too movement in fact African American women have been ... coming forward and speaking about this long before white famous white women in Hollywood had been doing so but I think\nThe behavior of the old white men on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd how they were too scared to question her blessing for directly for fear of appearing away Joe Biden and others who questioned during the Clarence Thomas hearings so they hired a woman lawyer\nTo do it you know that's a cop out or cowards\nThat is because of me too they knew they had to be a very very careful\nAnd so they were careful for a while and then of course Trump insulted her and ... her and then people followed suit and what ensued after her when Kavanaugh

get two groups of individuals perhaps the whose minds can be changed\nSo I mean we've seen Trump for example using social media very very effectively\nIs this the trick that in fact as being missed by one side and being used more effectively by another if in fact they're seeing Trump is this the idol of somebody that that they can follow her\nSo I think tricks are probably being mixed but I suspect you know I again you know we we were talking earlier about the the caravan heading towards the U.S border this is this is another feeling of that\nBuilding an impending situation that says oh my goodness me we are as close as we can possibly get\nTo a fifty fifty situation where somebody is only just going to win and you know we've seen this in in our own situations very recently in relation

become a candidate he has been using it and he he has like it's real time he's always like\nGetting gauging support and get engaging his voters so he made it a really good use specially though what\nWhat top right now there is a big discussion if what's up while I was responsible or at least to\nMe that I had an impact in this election in Brazil because what's up it's the biggest social meter right now that people use is all the time and ... because I think ... system you don't know\nAnd who is sending a lot and what kind of hate speech that is going for it to this to this spot for 'em and then so a resident or regulate it a little bit more a little bit like Facebook and Twitter\nBut what's up was a little bit out of the scope so from a so both on how to use it really well like

later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us\nI suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of the national community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I was born in Chicago\nNow there will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like Viktor Orban hungry who you mentioned in your book I'm like the alternatives to Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who listen to you and think\nWhat a ... view you know what a liberal Californian view your day mate has passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and go to all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react\nTo that you know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live in de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where they're going to we're going to be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to\nHave a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of being open to people uh you know that are different bash analogies cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions\nCollectively ... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you so you're you know not California and that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIf a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S\nVote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans surely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt is from Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um the Justice Department and\nI think that if he gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now\nAnd I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really are built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts independence of prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of his book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black yes\nIt's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk ... democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes\nBut platelets got in the middle ground that doesn't feel as if we've got to anything stable to stand on so I I think that balance between\nWanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that work together and work against each other at the same and the same set a sentence [laughter]\nSo identity politics is really saw shifting sons\nIn terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either end of this extreme and people gravitate towards the middle where we find unhappiness with it and ...\nTo the extremes which then become uncomfortable then we moved to the middle so that much in isolation and that constant brightening most shouldn't effectively in politics is really interesting do you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show my identity is that it's a multifaceted and so my political beliefs\nBut I think this issue Shia is is really I'm very profound and I think France is so key albums has stunted the debate which I Hope will be grab by people more likely\nOne of the assumptions as being that I'm the end of history that western liberal democracy is the way forward to we are not going to go in the fall of ... ... it's not going to go way\nWithout even though it's so new indeed and history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date\nAnd if it is if we do think it's the best system than we need to understand it in ... uh they didn't and and change it to the mountains who fashion\nThe tension that you spoke about essentially the tension between the value system of liberalism and the democracy bed which says a ordinary people decide what they want\nNow the value system uh his policy the system from which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people other people that suffer economic deprivation most\nIs that a few disenfranchised from the legal system and the ... and it is these these people that are hardest by extremists politicians who are anti democratic and in the longer term\nSo we do have a big issue here which does need to be addressed to insult about but much more likely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and cross but in a democratic system otherwise it's very French\nOne problem soon we're wrapping up the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy in the ... which is\nFine as lots of beating up you know there isn't the passion surrounding the neurons of liberal democracy is a ... um and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes and the extremes and the damn pens as they go towards the middle ground which is actually viewed as being safer ground\nAnd that's the ground you stand on ...

president Donald Trump pronounce the United states would withdraw from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty signed by America and Russia in Nineteen Ninety seven\nThe agreement was defunct hostage with Russia repeatedly violating its rules on it also left the buildup of bombs by China um tracked\nDuring the Cold War the ambitious ins creaky aimed to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons delivery systems it helped to protect Europe in particular from Soviet attack\nA hundred times both sides were prohibited from testing producing possessing ground launched ballistic on cruise missiles with ranges between five hundred and five thousand five hundred kilometers [noise]\nSo what does leaving the treaty means for arms control now I asked on diplomatic correspondent James Robbins first with Russia breached the treaty\nIt's very clear that the United states and I live in a way to think about being serious violations\nOf the treaty by Russia but equally the Russians think that aspect of the United states military posture in Europe and the diplomatic or missiles in Europe has an effect on demand to treat the other way so there's a balance of accusation if you like but I think\nThis is much more about ... and with uh the world should worry whenever arenas dismantled more than anything else\nChinese intermediate range missile development is arguably the biggest threat for the U.S [noise] but do you think America can or will do anything to try to now negotiate a new\nInteresting isn't it I mean the United states clearly believes that the constraint is on there as a result the IMF treaty because after all it can't break out and confront China with the sort of ... thinks it should in response to aspects of Chinese medicine physician it's clear the United states\nThinks that that is a future threat potentially actually far greater threat and the threat posed by Russia Russia after all is sitting on a declining economy\nTalks the talk and there's obviously still a substantial military power but we can see a state's emerging company in which China the dominant economic power perhaps in the second half of this century\nIncreasingly authoritarian perhaps if we uh take just a limited example of the evidence the BBC has been\nShining a spotlight on this week the face of the of the week people in western China the emergence of what looks like mass prison camps relatives Henri education centers\nIf an authoritarian China were to fall back into a militaristic nationalism particularly if it felt pressure at home\nI was political and economic if Chinese growth continues to stall as it has done\nThen perhaps it could emerge as the biggest single strategic challenge and the United states doesn't want to fields in any way constrain perhaps actually from beginning an arms race with China which is then ended or at least reduced in scale under threat\nBy separate arms negotiations with the Chinese but the United states wants to be strong position to confront China and it feels that way the limited treaty the IMF treaty dealing overly bilaterally with Russia that it is constrained\nWe seem to think less say as a result of this is Russia claims all author any advantages to what America is doing\nWell I think it's very simplistic does look to me that uh we might be less safe after all scrapping nine a treaty does feel like\nIt doesn't it scrapping at least one speed limits on that particularly dangerous section of road is something you wouldn't necessarily want to do\nAnd I get back to my big point there's a lot of concern

thousand injured in the wool a correspondent older Karen has just returned from Yemen to if anyone was putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to stop its bombing campaign\nIt doesn't appear to be the case I mean this has been a disastrous war for Saudi Arabia since it began when the Saudis originally announced their bombing campaign that was back in March or twenty Fifteen\nThey announced it was going to be a short sharp campaign to restore the internationally recognized government of president ... well that's turned out to be anything but true\nBy one estimate there have been airstrikes carried out by the Saudi led coalition in Yemen every Ninety minutes since then and the impact has been absolutely devastating in terms of the loss of civilian life in terms of the damage to infrastructure\nBut also I Would say in terms of the grave damage to Saudi Arabia's international reputation\nAnd the longer the conflict has gone on to more instances have been identified by the un of civilian targets being ... in coalition airstrikes hospitals weddings funerals schools\nWe went to the scene of one of the most tragic counted the notorious recent airstrikes in a place called die young and the

saw the empty desks we saw the new grave yard full of children's bodies the empty graves that are waiting for the remains of children that still have not been identified two months on\nOn there are many who are asking if there's another Saturday airstrikes actually amount to a war crime so it's a deeply damaging inexpensive conflict for Saudi Arabia and there's no indication that they have any exit strategy\nThey're all ... million people in Yemen facing found them in twenty Eighteen what did you see there\nHad an opportunity over a period of about two weeks to see the scale of the men's

energy clearing forest some demotion wetlands oh contribute to the problem\n[noise] CO two stumps heat from leaving the planet one reason why the average temperature is higher than it used to be scientists in the U.S now say that some technology able to capture count them is ready to be deployed on a large scale right now\nSo is this a solution to climate change I all star environment correspondent not McGraw the\nProblem with these techniques that they talked about here is that nobody's retry them yet because there's no real financial incentive to do them but on the basis of the calculations of these scientists and others have done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd that some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody had some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer technologies that are coming on there you know we're talking about planting trees and changing farming practices the brothers would be boring things more slowly fly into things where you've got these machines that looked like washing machine to fans in the ... of the year\nThey can do that right now the cost about six hundred dollars a ton of carbon that they are removed but the report's authors are actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a time if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove ... why bother reducing your use of fossil fuels and that's one of the big dangers the politicians and campaigners environmental is really worried about because if people think there's gonna be a solution ten years down the truck they'll keep flying they'll keep using me to keep driving cars the do all the things that are contributing to the problem right now\nTo the extent is carbon capture happening all ready and how can you make it more appealing\nAre there are lots of different things going on to the moments every country in the world is planting trees pretty much people are trying to change the way that they do for a station that the ... linked into ... tons of trees grow or they changed you know when they have\nQuickly the bigger more technical industrial challenge of you know focusing on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that because all these big bits of kiss tossed lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park is to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report has come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do blue carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshes Neal to see if you can protect those their main using source of our sing for common they soak up more carbon than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton per capita than not is really really cheap the bigger problem costs a lot of times we don't have enough of them you know the fight the number of coastal areas in the world is fine nice\nPeople want to build new coastal areas and you've got this thing called sea level rise happening as well which might wipe out some of the games are making so\nThe big tech not really happening a lot of smaller sake is happening and it's cheap and not just report things we do more than how do you\nIncentivize countries such as China countries such as India which have been industrialized in very very quickly and actually getting rid of some of the landscape that was doing carbon capture\nYeah both China and India are taking a lot of these steps in terms of planting trees and doing other things that are also on the sea building lots of coal fired plants as well [noise]\nHow this works out no one really knows to be honest with you the hope and belief among the richer countries is that if they develop better technology to capture carbon and sequester it\nThen there will be able to either share that technology but Indian China nothing really happened so far and there are number of intellectual property questions about all the the big challenges with China and India they remain on salt at this point\n... that's it from the well this week for now don't forget to join us at the same time next week for a look at what's happened in the next seven days
