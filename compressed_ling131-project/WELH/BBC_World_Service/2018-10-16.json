this report\nI'm surprised to see information reported about a potential release of information\nBut also I really don't think that the fallout from this incident is going to go way since the uh by the Saudis navy admitting to a version of of what happened and I might even short that\nPeople will entirely accept this a version of events without some sort of hard evidence but the fallout will not go away and cook possibly even intensify as the details become more publicly known\nWhen you say fallout do you mean the fallout between the United states and Saudi Arabia the international community in Saudi Arabia or the international economic uh\nAnd financial community and Saudi Arabia\nI Do think it it includes all of those areas particularly in the United states because it's at least being a

behalf of Asian American students who failed to gain admission athletes houses the policy noticed affirmative action which many universities choose to adults to give disadvantaged groups are best chance of getting in this\nMeans that they're not lesson just on academic ability the Asian American students say they were good enough to get in but what kept out because African Americans and Hispanics have their chances boosted by some direction racial balancing it's cool\nThat we have from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly\nNot for the phone\nI come from an Asian American background and a student at Harvard and I think actually that preparation tennis university and that's actually how many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case has affirmative action\nWe shouldn't just be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but sort of how many of action is impacting different communities and the point of affirmative action has been to support\nCommunities that has historically than underrepresented are excluded it seems like it's fouled Asian Americans right now as it looks like hardly\nAdmissions policies are discriminating against Asian Americans systematically keeping that embrace lower it's hard to say what Microsoft ... looks like a sort of how it affected me but I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in an ac rapidly\nBut the amount of Asian lacking admitted to Harvard has been saying around the ... I started having us\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard or an who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kelly ...\nA ... a her stance makes a lot of things and I I'm happy that she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action in support of affirmative action is not as she says to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of affirmative\nAction is to increase diversity of course the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been that's not been talked about as much in this\nLawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass\nHere at Harvard and many other colleges and universities across the country there are a critical masses isn't quite frankly Asian students um don't have to walk on campus and feel like they're necessarily represent there's a good group um or that they have to speak for every person from that background um is is particularly true of Chinese\nUm students are are students are Chinese backgrounds however for African Americans for looking all Americans for indigenous Americans is is not this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even ways affirmative action as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but just before you were at Harvard you you were UCLA and one of the complications of this fact is is that in California affirmative action isn't allowed so what was the effect\nOn the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I presume that that's how you felt\nAbsolutely and there was the case um I entered into a class of about two hundred and fifty are entering Austin\nAmericans um this is and\nThe state of California which is as much more than just a four or ... or ... or three or four percent African American and Mrs in an environment in which I was you know in classes debating highly intellectual and highly\nSocial issues that involve things like raise 'em in history and I was one of two African American men in the room just have a huge effect on my ability to um\nTo judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without feeling like I was speaking on behalf of everyone\nI can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional and of course what you'll you'll get to study principles and argue about\nA sort of intellectual facts are without being muddied in that way [noise] I Wish\nThat was the case yeah unfortunately it very rarely happen that way\nBut for example in your class was not one or two Asian or a Chinese and Marilyn how did we should defined them or have they all Reggie managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support and critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that there are underrepresented sub groups\nWithin an Asian Americans are among the amenities as\nA Southeast Asia and Pacific Islanders students I absolutely underrepresented um an all facets of higher education but if we're going to talk about Asian Americans are as a general group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice in front of accident and I argue schools that do\nAnd why would that be\nI think it has a lot to do with the caliber of students applying um the number of students applying um and what are they besides the gate the applications are obviously I I think it makes a lot since a lot of Asian Americans apply to harbor\nA one interesting fact about this entire lawsuit that is not discussed as much as that I'm twenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year um roughly\nIs Asian American but also twenty two percent of the application pool is Asian every year\nWell there you up affirmative action two sides of the student argument is an argument that uh is being taken to the court case are taken to court or against Harvard University at the moment\nI should say is a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action but Harvard as a private institution or because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do it and\nIt's just it's a private institution that they can make that\nGoes on you know less than ... do you have to be in a state where you can have affirmative action uh and many people are interpreting this is a really significant court cases over the legality of affirmative action in many of the ... just\nIn the academic sphere and I'm a there's lots of accusations about who's on behalf of whom and who's wearing a tool divided along sort of community\nAh backgrounds no I'm Talking about class in Britain that would be a class issue a rather than a a a race and the ... election

nations develop maybe scrambling to get into a\nAre those that can be invented ... controversial pronouncements lead by politicians that truth is not really truth comes in lines yeah and\nOne can only imagine what he just sort of social media and the Internet today that\nCross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there's a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare returns Schiller or many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then is just pure swell and I think that um this image as as a misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm In its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think are writing ... crosses mind could mean many things that could mean\nNot including a comet due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought coke constitute their co form one another\nThis for crosses all an indication that there was something deeply arrive in the morality of the author or more likely\nA one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate what I'm Talking about one of cross as more humorous pieces are set up pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries manned by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this piece Esperanto a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floored pros juxtapose then against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing is he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings\nThat are in heart in language but that has language actually obscures and so this has kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate sloppy language to either he didn't do publicity or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSo by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about more than that and they have yeah and these other schools are funded delusions two classic works of Jim and ... and Shakespeare as he said and he was a continued the ... tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of the truth or principle you've heard a few of these already and ... started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and lights it published them in book for several times\nBut he himself was all say aware of the limitations\nAnd now for ... never coincides with the trick is either a half truth or woman to half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows Joni Katrina why was say it's so important to him\nWhen I think at this had to really and they've been in relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't work out at the end and he very much disliked modern development for instance um they give back to max Reinhardt too\nGermany especially um he developed they own a mental maybe showy um productions\nAnd contrary to cross the kind of embrace that yeah tricks of blender\nBut what crossed imagined or was it ... just to stage for the spoken good and not to edit pieces to shorten them and and make room for for the stage but to really stay with the drama uh itself and the thing is\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crass than is before the first World War is someone who is surrounded by lots of colleagues fun to watch his\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably had a choice in pulling the others circumstance I mean this is fascinating

last three months that triples what she had before and she got a lot of money from\nIndividuals as opposed to communities are groups are companies or whatever and and it's from all across the country she's become it shows that she's the kind of this kind of see your head in this progressive business\nAnd does that mean that this rice and this one district does as we heard that from the former math become this bellwether for how the Democratic party is is running\nThe um progressing groups that want to prove they can win in swing districts are looking to this state she is one of the one in the only ones of this kind of new crop of leaders that in\nA conservative area so if she can win here you're going to see a lot more progressive trying to make the case in other swing districts that they can win and then they should get national support because look parties and did it\nIs there's something about what's happening here in Omaha Nebraska has brought to to the top and the Democratic party or is it simply a national picture [noise] oh so the\nDemographics of Omaha haven't changed all that much but I Do think that this is the year for progressive and you're seeing that here as well as elsewhere there we had progressive in Omaha\nBefore um but they never had a candidate to rally around like this and a lot of her policies are becoming kind of mainstream democratic principles and so you're seeing it she she has more opportunities this year than she would have previously\nNow we're talking about midterm elections which don't generally get used to an outside and that's going to be teachers so she's got some money she's got a bit of momentum she'd go energy nationwide but will not necessarily translate into votes so that's a good\nQuestion so her whole hypothesis is that she needs to give voter that Democrats in Nebraska should give voters a reason to be excited and then they'll show up on they haven't shown on previously for the more moderates so she's doing a lot of door knocking and be heard and she's been a lot of outreach to voters directly because her whole strategy is trying to turn out the vote\nAnd you don't see many of us had dumb bacon is sizzling bacon I vote but he ... he said on the TV every often out but you don't see it\nShe she does have some ads she's not focusing on it as much you might see more ads from her because she got that one point five million on but she also has spent a lot of her money on voter outreach which isn't the traditional typical\nPath they take um what about the Trump ... how does how does he play into this race in this state so\nTrump um came here and spoke and bacon spoke on stage with him on\nRight now it seems that cabin his nomination of cabinet in particular is actually turning on both sides so Democrats are really mad about cabinet but you're also seeing Republicans mad about how Democrats handled it and one thing that I'm hearing a lot from Republican women is that\nThey are upset that liberal women have kind of been speaking for all women and they want to send a message no we're not\nWhat the the ... these other women say that we are\n[noise] that was Roseanne morning or from the whole world Harold Jamie you clearly dumb the defining grease on ... and was from John ... where are you moving next\nYes well actually heading north east to a state that is a millionaire to news outlets and it's not just in America because that would bring to which comes in one or two times before most recently for the state of the union address at the beginning of this year we met some folks who uh well they were in a district which voted heavily for Barack Obama than heavily for Donald Trump\nAnd they were big fans of it are they still big fans will have a have a look at that will also be looking at the Senate race that which is an interesting one and pipes\nVery interesting the governor's race he's a a whole string of course of races in the midterms all of them will have a say in how the next couple
