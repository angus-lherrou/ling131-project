something by just by thinking about that but\nWould you want to it so easy for me to just north to rather just\nJust won't do that you don't have to have [laughter] very common thing Rachel mentioned as a role in national\nThing to do and when you do and to not check on your life like allergic to changing something in your house to the emotional during it\nThanks to Sophie page on no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the ... for that means trick\nNow I'm going to go out on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on stabbing does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either but it was a bit surprised by how strong ... version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on ... how can something that we know isn't true you still have an impact on the way we behave\nAnd to Jane rises and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nSo where did he superstitious or choose to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process sees and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen\nWe are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not so even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being causes related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is\nThe way that he respects or sort of the rules of some that are mind will rely on so it's a a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program on on those a bit in the museum about voodoo and um but producing ovary cruelly brought along some pictures of my some loved ones and I was asked if I Would like cut them up or just a she couldn't bring myself to do it oh just so chasing it with the bad outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative ... are sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you just drew a smiley\nSeems so problematic it's that it's the actual representation of your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how\nA very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources or sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition and the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintained that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment\nWant you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep your ... or you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what do you go full\nYou should go for the two [laughter] no question you're rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't traded their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile thought they could really high number and so what you're saying there is the kind of choice the between the intuition and amend the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and an sometimes rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first ... system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not the rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the costs of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition she this is going to be really bad if I ... through a picture of a loved one\nThat's a big cost so I'd rather avoid done not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the\nOnly thing that I Would add to that description there is\nHaving an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying I mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining it as a possibility Jane writes in that\nYou are listening to crowd signs on the BBC well that is the program the onset of your questions about life on the universe is\nWe've heard from Jane about how our natural tendency is human beings to seek causal connections can help us to understand all world that can sometimes lead to a rational or false belief is that what's happening with list them also to help us all to that question is David Spiegel hope to an ex but to uncover incidences [noise]\nDo you believe that in good or bad luck

you've got to include a a range of of ethnicities\nSo how do you go about building booze coalition that cooperation\nWell so I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just to just that yeah as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the whole point\nOf intersection allergy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are a state of values and objective um there are many applications of intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms and discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the ah claims that were made by Anita Hill I'm what I argue there was that there was a common history\nOf anti racism and feminism sound and the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge admit that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination was largely set forward by African American women plaintiffs\nWho are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into feminist\nShoulder is but but but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights companies have looked at the history of looked as you say the failure of times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black ...\nI'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist road it's time to ... back into survival mode the tradition dumpster fire on live by black\nFeminist agenda and [laughter]\nI mean I could build this land\nPeople who actually uh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group miss\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are few individuals um who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who\nUm is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of a white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it as well in fact\nI'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe doctors lazy Ford there is a far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean that patriarchy isn't working sure it doesn't mean that we don't need the intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time\nGet I get the into sick now the argument that you can bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to orders are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the ... the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pull them groups\nOr many of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was\nA multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nHow do you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the president there do you feel about Morocco bummer 'cause he's with the midterms coming up his reruns of the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and they'll GDP Americans not as well known since I he said I go vote\nFrom every demographic do you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect bronco bottom of actually Washington rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWhat they can stop for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nUm I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor\nI'm sort of a difference of within a broader reality\nThat we are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he tried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's a good one\nDimension of American power to an unjust\nTo final thought on that as we go into elections that we're in an election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nA ... democratic votes as he said I clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the coach tree liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that\nAgain in this world of of of sort of into sexual morality and I'm I'm group based politics it is a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAn eye out and make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones they gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator who was the first a Democrat or to the elected of Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use and black women\nAs the whales and the best but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them as we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class 'cause black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political global mobilize\nA coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this election

be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world kind of like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably to understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator without having that conversation on telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other or at least they think\nWell yeah I mean I ... when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people respond to these people or box or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them do use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is critical trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that\nAnd it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially an architect did by a group of fake accounts on social media\nCan you say the mainstream news meter complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company but it has and you have not yet\nBuried under ... who suggests a variety of on says to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all those new they're connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized attack you know trying to get it if\nHe centralized but it's also you can't delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they have this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic that this is going to ... that we have a way through because ultimately we've all got to live with the Internet is not going to go away because on invented\nCan I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we'd outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like Tim are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that's actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I'm absolutely optimistic about it\nAn optimistic berets and dissident who like Larry small sees the beginnings of change but neither of them expected to happen quickly\nIt's not just technology it's going to require major international country by country regulation of legal changes\nIt's a bill of rights there's nothing more fundamental and it's going to take years if not decades to move in that direction but the solutions are beginning to be on the horizon\nInternet pioneer Larry small I guess we should stress that this is just one vision a point of view that he's putting forward there will be many no doubt from Internet firms and elsewhere who disagree over the design fools he's describing\nBut whatever size you settle the debate about the future of the net vulnerabilities is clearly a cheap ought to public conversation now\nWhether the Internet changes will not than expect coals for an
