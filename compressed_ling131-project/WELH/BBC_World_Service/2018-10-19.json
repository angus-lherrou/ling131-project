I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have left to do with identity of a sudden than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that's a little bit more Adrian past\nWhat does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized identity individuals and small groups very often focal minorities that saw rocky ... for quality and inclusion and democracy\nIs now elevated of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes us different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things I find this to get citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in math its response to individualize and but I think it's an individualized response rather than a more communal collective response\nYes among yeah to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems from mixing goes up so I'm the one hand what we're seeing at the moment is\nA lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAs sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups as ... elements of the state line of trying to\n[noise] I think the term ... around the ideas that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I regarded as anti individual for ma'am part\nJust about any group that I was born into female American what have you I Would like out of that is I find it can find it in and my idea of what identity means is much more individual and I regard to these groups that we didn't choose none of us did\nThe real victims those real oppression exploitation but the way to go over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it's by that human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't ah to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have simply not recognized to address exactly in\nFact I watched the debate team movement did they said look this is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what has to sexual swans and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but there is real discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit toward a more justified would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin Americans than a comedian who falls enough with a white um how can we go into sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which bad movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying what isn't the problematic that this round protecting this has to find a white wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the ride was saying\nWho cares if you find somebody who he was enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate fat and was parts of the left but some of food that was problematic exercise leave for me is the crux of disagreement about what society ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between\nCultures rather than one where everybody is to stay in the lane and devoid cultural ... on you to picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably ...\nIdentity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up I find some of the discussions off\nWhy can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value as the way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life who even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after I mean we don't politics until I kind of ... Hollywood wrong call them light all I Want to\nBring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on the issue of they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well I think\nThe we what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not\nVenture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful is on a an an order a social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are\nSocializing with people who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party\nAnd there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe you're gonna think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word\nMe might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's the intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also political correctness on ... pops and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined was more than the country of course they're real differences out and that to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out to the ... we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she moms yeah of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus then they shouldn't be warm\nBut at the moment we simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's I think that's what you said on\nSaturday on strike I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I hadn't ringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that would get unless black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples but first what I wanted to make the but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that mess disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers is also true but the majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the registry small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to be a few cases if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice but you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go out to parties you should also be worried because actually there's white\nPeople who got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off people have never lived in monoculture Monday religious monolingual states this is no send you a\nSituation that we find ourselves and why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's just 'cause I guess is 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee no longer function fiscal policies trade unions churches synagogues temples mosques some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions banking situations and the communities are not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized nothing the problem with the sensor them Tuesday's fight definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we are talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier\nBut the tree or democracies in the world was founded on a mono ethnic mono cops hotel conception of themselves and thank God who started to challenge that and we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more to ethnic societies that that if something has talked quite new ...\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which they're addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that way by if his minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called\nIdentity politics and this means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering okay\nPledge to think about that thank you for now to our panel\nGrandfather Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver in Adrian pops we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let us know what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us at the real story at BBC don't don't UK or treat me at ... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to\nJust such a BBC the real story in your poll cost app\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

happy and his biggest space people pushing themselves into\nWhat I think now because the mainstream parties offering something that's intrusive an off they still stand for you know a consensus that has failed people economically and culturally\nAnd I do agree with that of course the working class is not simply washing and lots of other components of the of the working class has suffered in often suffered more than the white working class but saying the other people who suffered more doesn't mean that those who have suffered who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against the status quo and and who reached to tell them that somehow that I didn't see much as last semester father does not like I'm not saying I'm not saying you did what I'm saying is\nThe editor somehow we can just say\nWe look at the most depressed people in the early ... an in yet everyone else should just you know hold back on bad feelings is is is not that was approaching ... rational utility maximizing preaches\nWe ... we have people who embedded in relationships institution the knots and feelings do methane disabled belonging and if I'm going to place to people to communities and countries masses we kind of feeling out of politics or will it got to\nThe obvious question that footage from that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease positive reason for identity politics that actually it is people expressing a sense and on the longing that she ... the identity that was that fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there that these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement shouldn't saying on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far ends of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties\nAnd I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly you're either Protestant or your Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinctions it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nIn northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their tried then they want representatives\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully\nAnd advocate for their interest not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door of all in some ways it was six if you'll\nNever end the remote the in India and you a pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India\nWinds bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country\nCountry is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and we we do naturally I think as\nAs a species break up into what are often very competitive clumps sorry Ken I'm confused I\nThought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice ... tribal it is a problem\nBut I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural tendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around\nTo break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away but it but it's a good politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay\nI mean I'm very bad at all I don't know I mean I think the\nQuestion is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who have close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ... and the question is how do we deal with this in highly diverse society in a productive manner\nA one on such which I've bussing these talks have been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for collective belonging and to become a form of cosmopolitan when I look at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years\nAnd I don't think that's realistic because actually especially in the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated hop wild feast of nationalism to try and claims for sales to make it inclusive to say that either hire a collective\nUh it is a level of magic kingdom of looking at states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under the common identity ... how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us in a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots ...\nOf patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you love the people of your country or wherever they from you can also respect patriots you love that country is a question of mutual respect\nFor the other hand around so bad I don't think I think that he's saying that you love 'em that it really enjoy it isn't out of control what's wrong and loving your country and its people accuse people of identity politics but I'm saying you're not just because your liver you opposed to nationalism I imagine you are and you join us\nUm you know you're you're ... you're\nSaying making my country but for the\nMajority of of of Hindu majority lets them so I look at nationalism that's something that has served stuff that's in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the right response will be ... it is the order nationalism over Congress party but sad but we're all Indians respective\nAll night and I believe that he's not he's not true and it's not as though the older a form of nationalism the Congress talk he didn't have an ... elements to it the one\nHand that we do our days of areas of angry as well as looked at what age and if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is a we\nWe do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity group saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not\nSuch gets well 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and some ... ...\nYou know we can be worked as we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes on national element is still within the cross 'cause it's bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan is and I guess just spoke about\nThat can doesn't have to uh can be a bit abstract I think at the your PIN number isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European British or German or French but I also feel they have a local events the diesel a as a possible\nSo that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with it's great to have lots of people here and the answer is that if everybody identifies primarily with the national try and\nSay I'm Jewish I'm a Hindu Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we had our sense of collective pride and the level which coincides with the actual ...\nInnocence doesn't everybody carry multiply it must have called on the edge of the English in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly\nDo and the people like ... like a Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of people who share my identity is to emphasize our common interest as Americans and identify and emphasize the ways\nIn which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of a ... a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent\nAnd let's demonize any form of collective flowing above it level to such an extent but we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common\n... that's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national at something that let's to breakfast at which is a big nationalism was on the paint by a sub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down\nThere is a clear correlation between what you were called something nationalism that his English nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again it's I don't think we can have the right fit into that I had radically in the ...\nWhile I mean it it actually quite a lot of people ... did that for breakfast I I personally am not accepting the ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different notions\nOf what an Asian might be my understanding of an inclusive nation is one that doesn't discriminate and I think there was some amount of xenophobia in the Brexit vote and secondly one that recognizes that the international sphere can be when when\nDot O.

this stage is the last year we saw this critical shift in thinking of the of the Chinese\nAuthorities recognizing that they want to redirect resources towards the households ... household\nCan go out there and spend more can consume more an power the economy and a part of that was to say okay well we probably don't want to be taxing having these high import tariffs on on what it essentially will be consumer goods so since last year they've they've started on to take these these cuts in in Paris\nI'm In in the import tariffs\nJust is is this trade war is is kind of is ballooning so on one hand you have them hiking or tariffs on imports from the u._s. but we've also seen in the trade date to the the authorities have basically gone down the path of saying okay well we're we're not going to

to promote a anti sexual harassment ...\nExplain exactly what you mean by that ... usual buddies ... this was ...\nYeah yeah yeah I I I bought a billboard whatever what what what wherever I go so I I

so the Nazis pill for his connection to the last month off to Seventy is a painting from his collection to women and a garden by Renoir was finally returned to Sylvie at Christie's in New York\nThe ... you know say that the Morgan bank and that's where the Nazis told them most of them were found after the war that we're still paintings missing five hundred to walk including the one I received back in New York\nWhere you will wed this one particular painting had been missing all alone\nNo never I never heard about this story\nThe war was a taboo subject I suppose that's when my grandfather died you would never expect we could find his paintings so long afterwards and he died I was Fifteen so I was very young and I had no idea about what happened\nAnd I discovered many things up to my mother died now I must say that I've got tons of questions but it's only five or six years ago that I was told that\nThere were a paintings that belonged to my grandfather ... ... what did it must have been quite a shocking revelation [laughter] I mean yes it was a huge shock and awe after a few weeks\nI've been told that that guy was investigating on the property of the painting and\nIt's your painting so they going to give it back to you so I was a yes\nYou did not know that it belonged to you I mean hasn't made you more curious to go and look at water the looted property there is that belong to a grandfather\nWhat we know actually above the five other paintings\nBut I've got an everyday life and honestly I'm not living with that kind of idea\nI think I'm already been very lucky to get one back but you can't do it when you you can't keep this particular painting unfortunately not because the French government compensated for the paintings so as I headed back\nTo give the

the peace so everything about ... transaction where subsidies was arm's length in good faith for park west\nWould have had no notice no knowledge does know wasn't any red flag whatsoever there would have clued park west into the fact that this was actually stolen from the Weinberger family by the Nazis database\nSomewhere that tells you which pieces of art of stone Leno or considered you know

these will say the same thing it was not listed on any day today so holiday to know\nYour presumably their relationship to the piece goes back to at least Nineteen Seventy five looks like it's sold to suffer these auction in March of Nineteen Seventy five in London and then it's sold began through subsidies in December Nineteen Seventy five in Johannesburg\nSo they they certainly have a much longer
