I'm\n... these ... these these computers were compromised once they were running and small these were able to access\nA them and according to Bloomberg they say that after investigation for a year and they've called evidence sold for a wide ranging attack\nAnd that the Chinese spies got access to search he launched companies and many federal agencies in the United states\nA hobby 'cause I was gangs ... whether it was mostly at kind of ... and that kind of business espionage all if they're also organizations such as that you know the accusations leveled against the Russians\nWere these days um

government and um you know this this could actually help a lot of Chinese companies\nThat are connected to the Chinese state and also don't forget to China is trying to push I go to planet by twenty twenty finally that wants to be a world leader in lots of technologies President Trump has criticized Dotson reckons it's a threat\nSo that could you know you can see that this can be a ... it's very difficult to tell sometimes if these allegations are correct where basically the China state ends and Web business begins\nBut whatever happens these are the secret saw rump all basically very very useful are just sort of been saved at Amazon and apple apple has posted knowledge that there's any substance to ah Bloomberg's a claims and then they say that they haven't found anything to support them\nInteresting interesting times and you thank you very much indeed\n[noise]\nNow let's take a look back at the century old massacres I Wish that hundreds of African Americans dead in the city of Tulsa in Oklahoma\nThere aren't they just may Nineteen Twenty one has been described as one of the worst episodes of actual violence in us history when a white mauled descended on the ... of Greenwood setting fire to hundreds of black owned businesses and hung killing more than three hundred black people and leaving more than ten thousand\nMany calls for a detailed probe into what actually happened it's also mayor has said that there will not be an investigation into whether there are a mass graves in the city from that time the announcement comes as Tulsa prepares to mark the hundredth anniversary of the violence and after the Washington Post\nQuestions about what happened to all those years ago I spoke to Tulsa city council member of and that's the whole Harper was been behind this investigation encouraged it before going into the pro she told me what we know what we know about what happened a hundred years ago\nObviously there was there was much racial tension in the community and there was a black man named Dick rolling\nWho worked in a hotel shoe shining in downtown Tulsa the story goes that he was actually in a relationship with a white woman who also worked in the hotel in the elevator\nAnd they would sneak off sometimes to see each other and one day they were caught and the story goes that the white woman they say screen right but in recent versions that that wasn't necessarily\nThe case that she didn't but at any rate the racist white community use that as an opportunity to destroy the black community the business community of black Wall Street this relationship is believed to be the cause of the new fancy dance which was which was a massacre\nAnd so the rampage began in may thirty one and Nineteen Twenty one what happened when the white mom descended on Greenwood\nWhat happened a massacre is what happened\nA rumor began that a mob would hang your ghrelin\nThere was a group of black men who were veterans of World War one who were armed who came back\nFrom war and knew how to protect themselves and so they went down to the courthouse and basically demanded that that he not be Hong later on they had to go back down there when they went back to the second time they were armed again this was because of the rumors of of\nThe attempt to kill growling and the white mop got angry that the black community even had weapons or that they would even dare to protect themselves or protect their community or protect growling\nAnd a white gentleman grabbed the gun of a black gentleman\nAnd the gun went off and that's when they say hell broke loose and they say over three hundred people were killed I think it's way over three hundred but we know that there were many many people who would never heard from again I guess historians or should I say white people\nWho wants to tell the story would like to believe that a lot of people just left and never return and I'm sure that's true in some cases\nBut not true and others and so that's why it's so important that as we come to understand and come to know where some of these grass mass graves are located that they'd be excavated in that we honor them that we memorialize them but also to get a better sense of how many people were actually lost\nWas this something that was generally known in Tulsa do people talk over the years about the possibility that there could be mass graves after that rampage\nThat there could be mass graves absolutely yes we absolutely knew that\nThere were inquiries network ... the community has certainly asked but it was left up to the administration of the city or the at that time and in past administrations they declined to do anything about it they said no\nA lot of this is still left buried and we want to uncover it\nThe truth is going to come out I Believe that they are still some people alive\nThat had something to do with what happened on the drifts all night and so it's important to me because it's going to to allow the truth to come out allow some closure and most importantly to me is going to honor our ancestors is going to honor those people\nTo get more and that we're joined now by not head but daily as she is medical director of a special at Athens unit at at um at the national emergency infectious diseases laboratories in at\nThe U.S you're very recently you were deployed at any outbreak region close to the border between the DR see and you've gone to now had what was your reaction to this incident were you surprised that people are still in denial\nUm thank you for having me I actually my initial experience than two thousand fourteen in the early on when I was at the border this time I didn't really go into the RCs I can speak from my experience in the last ... or\nThis is a scary disease right and I think as health care workers you must see that the the immense amount of care that we must take with a personal protective equipment with the but the isolation of patients all of this\nTends to be quite alien and you're trying to convince people who are suffering from a disease that potentially is has a high mortality to lead their family members to be\nTaken away at a time when they'd rather spend those last moments with their family members and so I I think all of those are already dynamics that are in play to create trust and um\nI I think to act it out I think particularly in the are the are looking at an environment where there has been active conflict for a long period of time so you're asking people to come into care to to become stationary and and and to give up that amount of trust you know to to outsiders wage which is I got to be hard to begin\nIt's interesting though because I could understand that maybe in twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you said there was the outbreak and and places like Sierra Leone Shirley own and people were still trying to come to terms with the fact that they cannot properly say goodbye to a loved one who's died they can't touch them they can't bury them\nBut the DR see for example that had many Ebola outbreaks and in the past ... you would expect that in it\nBy now people know that it's so dangerous that you shouldn't be in contact with with the body of someone who's died of Ebola\nI I think that those are two very different community and you don't know if the people who are involved currently had that knowledge permeates through those communities right I mean if the knowledge is there it's not so much potentially a knowledge issue as much as there is a trust issue\nI mean think about climate change him into the same thing like you have so many people have the science and may not believe that it's the same thing here where they may have been told it but it's in the end it it comes to building long term bridges to those communities and and having those already in place to for a crisis like this happens\nAnd I think um that's why you're sort of seeing that district and not and and I think these are communities like I said that has been affected by conflict for a long period of time that may not have that trust at baseline how do you prepare\nThere was a health worker um to to care for the patients or to go into this area here for the patience to go back to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash it\nI Can't even imagine I can tell you just without in in the early on when I was taking care of patients it was hard to begin with because you're providing care in this very strenuous situation that takes a lot of physiological reserve\nBut it also alters the kind of care that you can provide you know it alters the relationship you can develop with the patient because you're in these guards you know these personal protective equipment\nAnd then to add to all of that I think you're also\nActing in a in a in an environment where you're worried for your own safety and I think patients can sense that rate and and and we do our best to make that connection and so all of those things combined in in addition to sort of\nUm having going into a community that you you have not care for the past this is why national healthcare workers training national healthcare workers and\nMaking them available and making giving them their resources is probably the best strategy in the future because they have that connection getting connected to the community and that's why the artsy has been successful I mean you can see the prior outbreak the one that happened in ... like they were so successful in controlling this\nBecause of those existing network and religions a bigger outbreak that requires more outside forces\nNow had thank you so much with is not had Delia their medical director special pathogens unit at the national emerging infectious diseases

is medical director of the special pathogens unit at the national emerging infectious diseases\nThe bar trees in the United states I spoke to her a bit earlier about these kinds of attacks from people who are still denying that this virus exists\nTheir workers you must see the immense amount of care that we must take with a personal protective equipment with the with the isolation of of patients all of this tends to be quite alien and you're trying to convince people who are suffering from a disease that potentially is has a high mortality to leave their family members to be\nTaken away at a time when they'd rather spend those last moments with their family members and so I I think all of those are already dynamics that are in play to create trust and um\nI I think to add to that I think particularly in the are the are looking at an environment where there has been active conflict for a long period of time you're asking people to come into care to to become stationary and and and to give up that amount of trust you know to outsiders wage which is I got to be hard to begin\nWith it's interesting though because I could understand that maybe in twenty fourteen when all of this was happening and as you say there was the outbreak and in places like Sierra Leone strongly own and people were still trying to come to terms with the fact that they cannot properly say goodbye to a loved one who's died they can't touch them they can't bury them\nBut the DR see for example that had many Ebola outbreaks and in the past ... we would expect that it's become part of the general knowledge that you know the ... by now people know that it's so dangerous that you shouldn't be in contact with with the body of someone who's died of Ebola\nI I think that those are two very different community and you don't know if the people who are involved currently had that knowledge permeates through those communities right and even if the knowledge is there it's not so much potentially a knowledge issue as much as there is a trust issue\nI mean think about climate change write him and it's the same thing or like you have so many people have the science and may not believe that it's the same thing here where they may have been told it but it's in the end it it comes to a building long term bridges to those communities and and having those already in place before a crisis like this happens\nAnd I think that's why you're sort of seeing that district and not and and I think these are communities like I said that has been affected by conflict for a long period of time that may not have that trust at based on\nHow do you prepare there was a health worker I'm up to to care for their patients or to go into the area here for the patience to go back to go in the area but also to face this kind of of of backlash it\nI Can't even imagine I can tell you just without in in the early on when I was taking care of patients it was hard to begin with because you're providing care in this very strenuous situation that takes a lot of physiological reserve\nBut it also alters the kind of care that you can provide you know it alters the relationship you can develop with the patient because you're in these guards you know these personal protective equipment\nAnd then to add to all of that I think you're also\nActing in a in a in an environment where you're worried for your own safety and I think patients can sense that rate and and and we do our best to make that connection and so all of those things combined in in addition to sort of\nUm having going into a community that you you have not care for the past is by national healthcare workers training national healthcare workers and making them available and making giving them the resources is probably the best strategy in the future because\nThey have that connection getting connected to the community and that's why the artsy has been successful I mean you can see the prior outbreak the

that pile is no way but there's a paradox this country is still a major producer\nAnd exposure of oil and gas on the real story this week we're debating Norway's energy future what\nA country that's

you how strong would you say a new ways green credentials\nKerry and his ... well I Do\nBelieve that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention\nWas a very it's political parties have done the wreck or several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across the highway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of ...\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical and that's caught the eye major leaked towards a more green society especially we know that the transport sector is a big country be thrown into the field to credits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active\nPolicy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has\nThe oil and gas sector because it gives us the money to do all the research on how\nOld is the green technology development\nGay Sunday is that I think that because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better global and we do a big job abroad and we do it'd be job inside no end up is because we have the money for more than gossip to do the job\nWe do a lot of things you can do reinforce numbers on those we do look with the electrical cars you know where that is a good thing\nAnd say ... say far from all the panels these green credentials that Christopher ... are you going to agree I agree\nWith the examples they have with a domestic strategies and spending a lot of money abroad for the rain forest but I think\nTwenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and the ... transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing fulfill unit in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy\nThat's holding you transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the ... and it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment it was fine as you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it and places like the ... seats in the ... I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debates so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the barn see today they will still be producing and twenty seventh day\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets ... can Goodman says\nWell I think we have to see it on a great to scale because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on coal\nInto work but I don't know oh you know we're talking about my point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas or even oil they will be more green in the postal world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener\nRe first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually if yeah ...\n... ... in this in this moment of transition it\nProbably does make sense then driven the bar and see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there I think it's\nLimited how long a county or and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... find out what's next sense and and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to the international conferences where we are discussing climate change\nBut at the summary of the whole conference it was saying that Norway is the bad guy and put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and pull them out what's going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good sunny stuff\nI Would look at the time frame because ... says well it could be draining until twenty seven to ... yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I eat a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based\nIf we'll go to do a big big job you're going to increase renewables about six thousand percent unless it's a huge huge job ... on on how well do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that he lied to no end and we'd be debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce\nIt's being built toughest new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types that renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil team competition with the do as a politician and in a country like new way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough is anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become used to have I been working environment place just for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify yourself in this I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can Goodman says this kind of\nWe have to look on what are our options walked all the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable\nBut where do you have to do so well uh you get that perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but uh if not you have to produce it by making\nSome of our Lance part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineer stuck the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called the new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift\nSo my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process and oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green\nOr at the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and use it is both a sense\nWhich have successfully than no trial with ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time on this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to this is one of the great things that we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like another Norwegians state\nYou construct them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we're\nCarry you wants to come to his she's yes it's definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway what effort political party actually ... let me just explain what we mean by that cash a story and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take the call them for the environment and and put it away the underground\nOr under the ... yeah so we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology ... it's a matter of making it profitable and making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting government system quite all of a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and CCF has been focused on an alright for Twenty years I think that also I needed to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think women know what the harm is doing the climate change is if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you please do less than what you think is a program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC don't casual UK and you can subscribe to the ... such the b._b._c. the real story pulled coughed up\nDistribution of the b._b._c. World Service in the U.S has made possible by the American public media producer a distributor of award winning public radio countered eight PM American public media\nWith support from the three R O T addressing the world's most challenging problems that the convergence of artificial intelligence oil to the ... cloud computing\nMoritz see three our own T ... they are\nAnd\nThis is Rhode Island public radio more news from the b._b._c. World Service is coming up in just a moment\nAnd\nReporting on south coast communities is an initiative of the Rhode Island public radio and the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth journalism alliance\nThat they have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so\nVery cause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export ignored by you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in in terms so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which you can\nFurther than oil actually had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can't government's\nFault no most of this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the developments in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a ... a great expansion Andy a matter of time sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants well then you have to\nYou've made it out there I Know but it's it's it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well if you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my\nAnd that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now and the energy sector is really happening and they just happening in other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the clothes higher polls that's absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls the way a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there's an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the barn and she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nBerets you could argue that no agent energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to lease powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia or China or ...\nAnd the parents said they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression area that we need to drill before rush up to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that nor by goes to Brussels and love bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nYou ... that is according to the carbon projects on if you see the court and Brazil has been originally sees the summer it is a totally different pictures coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe I\nGuess we'll exclude coal we've recorded lay on what you mean by that call them price the price you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy but\nOn the market inside Europe um the person that would be or to fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push out renewables\nThat he would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid something called the core of approaching no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to nibble energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia ...\nBall of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an odd investing in renewable energy so I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments that\nBut this is about what kind of view do we have for Europe past twenty states and Europe so committed to have\nSierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector after twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's a very poor country in the Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way in which treats citizen says that he gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of it stasis his new way\nAfraid pots on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting a far too short picture because no it was a will for states before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or to have this the only place in Europe where it hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on on thank God we\nDidn't have an ability we we have a very uh society in looking\nAt a lot at the history and one important objective and an incentive is supposed to keep in moderate pace of the construction\nAnd when they hit that limit that set in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years\nAnd then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states but we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\nBut but I guess I think what I'm asking is is somehow psychologically has allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nThat means yours anyhow [laughter] I mean we have we have a vote\nFor a state that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from ...\nTo pay for our running bills not from the oil and gas industry directly itself so for our everyday living and the for the political system for the ... sells it wouldn't have anything to do other than of course we will lose your income\nBut it would be very very stupid because in the European Union in the world they have to increase coal emissions because they would lose no reaching gas so that was my main points or in your home so I'm back to

are not on the seven of calls this all happened well roughly around this time last week\nBut because of the mudslide and because the enormity of it the possibility of living and pockets within not

day to know exactly what will happen on that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedure hold up today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and then all of this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up ... not normal and that there are barricades set up and there are ...\nJust about any voted any kind it it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills passing a bill they they aren't doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how vial the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if they sites towers them far more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Here Scott a David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of this for re have Grassley I think by and Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time limit on Senate votes if could stretch out for a half\nHour or more a before then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford for many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information\nBut Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides in both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years for example somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago\nI remember I remember that I actually remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be hurt\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nSexual assault even under the lowest standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this case is even worse than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event soon those witnesses either refuted or allegations or failed to reach\nCorroborate there for the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor couldn't bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of it\nWe have surly investigative judge Kavanaugh's background\nIn addition to the prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who have known judge Kavanaugh his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation is that we received are more than twenty committee staff members\nHave work night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations in the FBI confirmed what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and neither the Judiciary Committee or the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents does ever\nBeing good enough\nTo satisfy Democrat leaderships in Washington who staked out
