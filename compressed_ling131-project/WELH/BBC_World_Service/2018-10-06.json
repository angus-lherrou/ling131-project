Norwegian oil and gas which is an industry buddy and their crust office and associate professor of political ... to\n... say well conceivable I Want to begin by asking each if you how strong which you say a new ways green credentials\nCarry it has ... well I Do\nBelieve that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention\nWhat a various political parties have done the wreck or several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across the highway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Ken Goodman says\nI agree last month a fifty percent of all new cars where electrical\nAnd that's a ... a a major leaked\nTowards a more green society especially when we know that the transport sector is a big country be thrown into the field to\nCredits yes so for me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives us money to do all the research on how\nOld is a green technology development\nGave some days that I think that because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better globally and we do a big job abroad and we do it'd be job inside no end up is because we have demoted for more than ... to do the job\nWe do a lot of things seem to reinforce ... we do look with the electrical cars you know where I thought there was a good thing\nAnd say ... so far from all the panels of these green credentials their Christ office and ... are you going to agree\nI agree with the examples they have with a domestic strategies and spending a lot of money abroad for the rain forest but I think\nTake it out cleaning from the ground and where the good guys none of us I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of south such a climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being dependent on importing from ... in in many countries to want to be\nEnergy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy\nAnd that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the marsh gets\nTo which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you can sense shut the new ... new exploration licenses for it and places like the ... seats in the up to I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about here because if we accept and say yes to a new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing in twenty seventh day\nTwenty eight and that is a couple of decades after twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate gets ...\nWell I think we have to see it on a great escape because if you're going to shut down all the ... power pounced based on cold in the works\nBut it does not oil we're talking about oh yeah that's\nMy point is that if you have replaced\nCoal plants with for example gas or even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener\nRefers has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them fast enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worst agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way\nChristopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the parents see because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's best to then say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah cats here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw in the south pole and find out what's next fenced in and out came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle\nThat now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students at when I talk to them today and told them I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good son is a\nA would look at the time frame because ... says well it could be dragging on two twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a natural Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based\nIf we go to do a big big job ... to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nUnless it's a huge huge drove ... on on how do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you like to know where he smoked and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time\nAnd it's going to take a lot of drastic measures but it's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built ... new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with the do as a politician and in a country like no way would you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow enough does anybody else can I buy and well it's difficult in a way that it's become used to have I been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen there is such a moment and\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you think well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more always feels for the future can convince the kind of\nTo look on what are our options walked all the renewables\nFor example we are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our place to make their more renewable\nBut where do you have to borrow do so well uh you get to a perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of this circle but if you have to produce it by making\nBio diesel production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called at three new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's start with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green it's a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay or\nAt the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and use it is both a central themes in the transition into\nBut not one of which have successfully than no trial yet again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers do this is one of the great things we could use our universities for the ... from the burned see is like ...\nYou can stack them up on each other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution there's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are\nKerry who wants to come back and CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway ... effort political party actually agree on it sounds like just explain what we mean by that ... and it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take become for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government they no way are shifting governments have spent quite a lot a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and see the U.S has been focused on in our right for Twenty years I think we also need to challenge to politicians here with a greater plans because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nWe have to take a short break now but just to remind you ... you think of the program or if you have any ideas the topics ... the real story at BBC dull casual UK and you can subscribe to the ... such a BBC the real story you'll political stop\n[noise] distribution

[laughter] it's probably not extremely efficient\nAnd some home renovations that get personal no I'm not getting a new leader\nThat they have to pay so much more for that energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way it can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is ... ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical thoughts and chips because for a shift nation and I was being so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy secure it is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuck it talks about is only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway\nThey have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of his other it's just we're dealing with and I think of\nNew oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in terms so I think he would rather studied renewable energy at our university which accounts for other than oil actually we had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask where it came to him and said\nWell no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the merit to him a business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man and a ... a great expense and the a matter of time sector or because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have ... I don't think I think you've made that I Know but it's it's it sounds like it doesn't say sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change do you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and that turned ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening in other countries that the moment I mean look at China that ... the speeds\nOf of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with ... but my argument if you will see now that renewable energy we indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really need is at the moment today by producing and exploiting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new ... twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian gas and all the gas\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the bar and she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than old not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energy as clean as some people might not reasons to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia and China and ...\nAnd the parents the they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before rush out to set the standard in the parents see and I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and ... for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nThat that is according to the carbon projects on if you see the current price has been originally sees the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high and Europe gas will exclude coal lift record lay on what you mean by that call them price the price you pay\nOn the market inside Europe on the person I'd be already fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push up renewables that he's\nStill a it would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid to be called the core of approaching no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to nibble and that is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to two guests and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exploding gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nIt does is about what kind of you do we have for your past twenty states and Europe so committed to have\nSierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector off the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's a very poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way which treats citizens fed the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep the wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of it stasis is no way\nAfraid pots on some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you're painting a far too short picture because no it was a will for states before they all came\nMade a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the ... the only place in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on on thank God we didn't have an ability\nWe we have various aside and I've been looking\nAt a lot of history and one important objective and an incentive is supposed to keep them moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years\nAnd then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independence states but we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\n... but I guess I think what I'm asking is is somehow psychologically has it allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow and it wouldn't have anything to do with our use of our cells because\nInsurers anyhow I mean we ... we have a vote\nFor states that's actually very clever because we have this big fund we use money from ... to pay for our running bills not from the oil and gas industry direct gates\nFor the political system and for the site itself it wouldn't have anything to do all of them of course we will lose future income\nBut it would be very very stupid because in the European Union and the world there to increase coal emission because they would lose no reaching gas so that was my main points are now so I'm back to that [laughter]\nThe Rhode Island public radio go to our I.

key senators despite an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations\nIn a public hearing last week professor Christine Blasey Ford said she'd been assaulted by judge Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers in Nineteen eighty to judge Kavanaugh denied the claim an allegations that he drank to the point of memory loss of the time this in a feisty confrontation with Senate says\nThe Republican Senator Susan Collins who is a key swing votes in the confirmation process that said she doesn't believe the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh are strong enough to stop his confirmation as a Supreme Court justice\nThat that ... percent do not me that her past her for what's not sexually assaulted that night or at some other time\nBut they do lead me take ... to head the allegation

justice\nAre there any other figures to people are still wondering about in terms of the final decisions\nEverybody know his sort of get an indication of where they stand no there are still some people wondering about Jack Black now he's given an indication that he will support Brett Kavanaugh but you may well remember that he was a senator who became concerns after he was approached and indeed cornered by a number of protesters\nIn a left in the Senate buildings at one stage and it was last week that he said he wanted an FBI investigation he wanted to take a pause and he has been

invoking people some people believe it less next time\nAnd that's when dangerous things can happen and when people can move back into the hands of the base of ... for example an extent\nUm so I was struck by by basically you know how how how difficult it is to get around to the needs are and how they were spending my time doing that\nBut also how they have to sort of balance that the that that

field of physics is being recognized is important area of physics it's great to get that powerful but secondly the right people have been recognized for the joke that they did\nUnfortunately in the past that have been instances of discoveries and big breakthroughs on set and people get recognized that or the other is\nThis time around donors Strickland ... have both been recognized for this prize equally answer that that there aren't that many women in physics compared to men at present and that there are so few women that have been recognized by the Nobel physics prize can make the it's a nice bonus to that situation we now have three women\nThat are recognized in the physics hall of fame of making contributions to the science and innovation as we know that\nYeah I'm so proud to be

you're trying to build with so they needed a technique that could boost the energy while keeping it but what we call the damage threshold\nAnd the application of this I was reading for example laser

basically you know and it gives you an idea of like you know how ah how much like cyber to his now are very much\nAt an essential part of the Russians are tools to advance a they're a foreign policy agenda and they use it quite at all and you know and the all the ongoing whether the conflicts or like geopolitical Russia's that they want to achieve\nAnd all those potentially being ... to pull them able to resist first tools for it to me\nWell basically I mean uh if you the thing is with a sign of crimes and cyber attacks is like more often than not\nUh they will be like you know what I had already infiltrate into the system without you know you knowing about it\nSo it's very challenging at you know about all the infiltration into the systems\nBut of course you know I think what happened yesterday kind of like raises more awareness on the Russian activity and I think even though you know some might argue that Russian is not very much like a shame of the nation that is that does cause adaptation of damage and that does ... said the way\nFor a more economic sanctions which would be like really a challenge for the Russian economy now\nLet me bring my guess into maybe all sorts of questions about what's on your mind\nWhen I was struck I mean I'm I'm a big fan of John le Carre and and and I don't know much about sort of modern the modern equivalent of fine but I was struck by the day is very tasty released by the I think the Netherlands I'm\nSort of at least about about the kind of how basic it seemed like they were doing you know how to go ... full of equipment or a jacket covering and I am tonight\nAnd and that they were sort of they came on to on diplomatic passport but presumably but with trace from from that from the beginning so it seems strange to me that we're talking about cyberattacks but then it had a very physical presence in the same time and I wondered about that is that how most of them are done or is is is that it just ... by by these ...\nI Believe like you know these sort of attacks that combined both uh I was reading so you have to do some sort of like a fun activity combine that with online activity or what happened yesterday with it of relations\nA show that can be for like a an embarrassment I Would say for Russians and better just because they are they've been very keen and the recent years to show supremacy and the ... and when you know you're caught with like a taxi receipts and like you know all these things and the mood of your car it shows that\nProbably there's some reckless I Am going on from the Russian policy but also when you are engaged in so many operations across the ... and then you know a sooner or later you would leave some ah you know in the disputed wide I Would call them digital bread crumbs but also some physical evidence that would then\nAh basically lead to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the ah these as spies with call in April and we only had about\nA a decent yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of\nAh coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about\nPatricia I'm just on a purely practical level um it seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is\nClick on a trip to infiltrate it'd be seen really what looked like clumsy attempts that that have been really quite effective and\nTo me what I'm setting is a story of it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean is there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds you think well\nI think of course like you know a ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective\nHaving all these governments coming together right and accusing Russia that also puts Russia and their and their way and a good place like you know that managed to get together all these governments to have all these like press conferences ago across the good old\nI guess if we see like that does for them and a good place by the end of the day or you know when you are or you know I caught\nYou know you know seven times a then it's kind of a you know like with what we saw yesterday was like you know how to them and they were kind of like put things into perspective and probably you know what they've been trying so you can lead to prove that they're so great at these kind of like starts in people's minds actually you're not that great\n... I mean you you use the word embarrassed when you look at the main figures in the crime and when you look for ... for example you just look for in burst\nYeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know whether I Would draw the lines\nOf seems that may be people looking at a red faced\nI'm sure they didn't receive than use our happy faces I'm sure that was like something that caused a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you try to show off your at your skills and then you get called in and some of that as a temp that's not really a great day for you\nAre but that's also like you know obviously like the the Russian or an additive old ways you know whenever they're called another there's an accusation as old as denial it's always like you know ah they walk or the or the investigations they older say there's no blues over your see although we did see you know the ... pictures and all of these things\nSo that's that's not really surprising thing\nWhich was not just as soon as I said I Do find that I'm finished that it it it just keeping into everyday lives of other things that you think we could practically due to to to push back not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives and a lot of pushback against the sense\nI think that's a very good question I and I think you know a one of the things that we could do as citizens and our daily life it's practice something we call digital hygiene\nSo very small things such as like you know a changing your passwords often backing up your data being a little bit kind of like vigilant and care for of how you deal with your uh online life like the same way though you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave your door open\nAnd I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like back this nice minimal things that would I mean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of ended in jeopardy practice this I'm a digital and hygiene you could limit up to eighty percent of the ... crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex the geopolitical level is that the choir\nLike the sophisticated level of sophistication\nAnd all night geopolitical level do you see any sort of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes well a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday you should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level\nSo late to this this month Russia or expanding on submitting to drop through the motions\nTo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for house they should behave with a to get a you know each other into cyberspace but also won a Jew I said just staying in you cybercrime convention due to place one that has been um implemented by the concept of Europe\nSo obviously there's a lot going on on the international scene that has not ...\nI think um so the Russian activity and like you know a they wanted to stability but also they want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that they ought to take something and the information we now that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals safeguard that on on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against this ad is really just do they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries that are not you know Russia or China or like with the states that are in the mid ... for the undecided the kind of like you know to as best I though you could easily argue that like\nThank you very much for coming in and led to his act May of ... house you're listening to the b._b._c.

a number of feminist activists I'm In\nGreat International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment stickers at subways and bus stations but before they were even able to to carry out that activity\nThe Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around to harass in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women to Beijing where they put them in detention in the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually preserved at an enormous global outcry um ... which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as you can preview unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nAre much more broadly defined really are the ones who made headlines for the reasons you just described how much will be representing the day to the lives of Chinese women [noise]\nWell this is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected\nA by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism um but actually the feminist community was

and continues to grow today\nLiteral debris magician would do as well I'm Emma may be a question to learn to\nThose high visit and I wanted to use it as going today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect to me to current day on the ground [noise]\nYeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally when made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles there's very very heavy Internet censorship there's no press freedom so unlike in the U.S where\nOn the news about Harvey Weinstein in you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is um the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse in China have virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles\nAnd and today you still see young women emerging up all across China um across sectors even across class\nComing out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse\nFor me to post to being censored on well\nThey a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the meat to hash tax so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when\nI'm really aggressively one activists came up with the idea of using him oh jeez I'm for the characters that sound like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie emerging made

whether this played into its it's all\nWell I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThat she doesn't have to compete with her brother for parental investments\nAnd so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more brothers\nWhy do you think we all ... apparently so troubled by some and when you look at communist ideology that doesn't necessarily say to you that

Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of ... now the domes famous sayings is that women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... for several decades in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women
