Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollars on from his father and help parlay that emptiness\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] and we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars ... two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also is the ... in many cases um these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nThose Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you'd run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then of being off to the races\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he use the money for\nMany of his ventures see how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City and elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to this father at these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments\nThat also see that when his cell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nAnd it you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips and at this period his father is there for him\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will sexually and do well and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's host in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months has dropped to that removes Donald was the sole executor afraid Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new will is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life were toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money and what for so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt to bring his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use the umpire for Trump doggedly\nAnd patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after a break we'll talk about another skiing used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate empire to

R. S.\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on\nThe lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families you hire the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or\nThey're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in the state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask\nYou to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or another comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself\nA few weeks of the publication of this both\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tracks schemes that we describe in the store it\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually coincides perfectly live at the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice in the song money money money might not happen in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the\nMess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities and so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that it's interesting when I think about\nThat I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it allowed\nTo go [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh just\nThe three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy but only write them they're\nA little claustrophobic the item imagine [laughter] and then other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it and stuff\nThank you for telling us about it Suzanne ...

know\nWhen they get work please\nI've been doing some research do research she got to help me do you think that you have this under control [noise] and I am ...\nI understand why do things with me any difference alright I'm attract craziness you were just embarrassed because I was like you know this amazing thing that you're special treatment or something and you don't like why am now who are you asking me down here and this is why I Am\nToday we'll hear parts of terrorists interviews with chefs first her conversation with David and the chef recorded in two thousand date she started with a question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how your son's personality changed when he was using that\nHe he became unrecognizable or he went from being\nYou know just one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nYou know this coast a sort of coming out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost he was given bombs and he was\nJittery and and then his behavior changed I mean he went from being ... sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was ... he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable that he would do\nNick why was nephew adrenalin preference like when you started using it what did he do for you that that made you want more\nWell I mean with all drugs I sort of had this feeling but yeah with math particularly with like I've always been I'm really\nFor that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was an neck would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know\nNick didn't agree for a long time it's just that he that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control he had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and in recovery I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of time you know trying so hard\nTo practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe and ultimately you know when I sit with myself in the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nSo that the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important that we learned is that there isn't just one way there isn't just one way to get healthy again sober and to stop using the first thing that Nick told me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you mean about the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that we had was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... ... you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that but I mean you know that's what he says that but those three months were essential\nTo do that program that you not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of that but um\nThere was a lot of like experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experienced some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all and that I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do\nWith a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nGive it did you find you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is um it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before\nThis is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is a way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they told me but all of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through [noise] ... what does it mean to you if you don't believe in God\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question\nIt was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save neck please help heal my son I remember that's what I chatted to myself over and over and over again\nAnd it was way be that way just to stay sane and it just so focused on something that you know that I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um what part of what saved you from your math addiction was it degree a self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think when the we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean that's you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's it's ... I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know they can help you I think that's awesome after they\nUh Nick tells a story in his book but to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see\nUs I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy or we were in this we haven't seen that for a long time in in ... you know let's let's invite neck to join us we were going on a family vacation and it came over to the U.S\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what had been going on and was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that it's I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and we had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed by you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving oh I'm that's what's going on here I'm studying my I I don't really want to leave party wants to stay here\nAnd be a child or going to be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... ... and then all of a sudden he said that he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back and the rest of the trip was it was great we had a really nice last day but then he said what just happened he said another time in my life\nThat moment would have just been the beginning of dissent and it would have been the kind of dissent that ended up and they're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then it's a mess and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together well\nListen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the ... can you know you get a good luck with some you know is continuing in and everything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much thank you Terry thanks Terry\n... chefs memoir about his struggled with addiction is titled tweak growing up on methamphetamines David chefs memoir about his son's addiction is called the beautiful boy which is also the name of the new movie starring Steve ... based on both their memoirs here we spoke with him in two thousand date\nDavid Sheff returned to fresh air five years later to talk about what he'd learned about the science of addiction and recovery will hear that interview after a short break\nAnd movie critic Justin chained will review the new Melissa McCarthy film can you ever forgive me [noise]\nThe babies and this is fresh air [noise]\nYou've our family foundation supports WHYY stretch hair and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere\nCapital one what's in your wallet\nCapital one NA and from London me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting platform was over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more it go to meeting dot com\nThe Affordable CARE Act is the central issue in Arizona Senate race but the way voters perceives the law has changed we'll meet a mother who saw it as a lifesaver than a burden now chooses to go without insurance\nLike I don't have it back right now it's terrifying\nIt's absolutely terrifying I'm Mary Louise Kelly healthcare in Arizona's mid term this afternoon on all things considered for men hearing is\nFor um the public radio eighty nine point three FM\nWhere support includes doctor daycare nationally accredited infant toddler preschool and school age programs across Rhode Island owned and operated by Dr ...

is about the medical science of addiction and recovery 'cause earlier book beautiful boy about his son Knicks addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve Carell\nIf your child's under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nIn most places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks but um I never\nBut whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes neck would just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it uh but as things went forward I mean the last time that ... you know he's been sober for a long time it was after Nick and I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of vodka then I took one I thought to myself\nJust one which is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd send the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week\nSo he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the Higgs field and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatment before that were failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so ah\nIt shows that it's possible I mean people think that treatment can't work a mixed proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a twelve step program\nIs probably going to you know a a twelve step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just as the search for the book do you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program too I think most people know what the positive\nA part time but what are some of the problems you have to stop\nTwelve steps are completely a profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternatives\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when they became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I I was ashamed and I felt\nAnd over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got Al Anon meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where\nPeople are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling than I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\nWere sitting on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK ... if it's not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as person that just gives all update on his life is that's not ... too much\nIt's it's not I mean this is really you know I think he's gray market I said he's he's\nAn unbelievable person I've been out of his dad and so I'm I'm prejudiced but he hit extraordinary has just this lovely person that he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gone into recovery is really healthy he exercises\nDay he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade he's writing like mad he just had a novel or accepted\nSo you know we're just so lucky whereas if we're lucky ... I mean all these other things are are great but the main thing is that he's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it\nDo you have a chest thank you so much for talking with us and I'm the semi best regards to your son Nick I spoke with him once [laughter] on the show and and I'm so glad he's um he's doing well thank you thank you very much I've Terry thank you so much\nDavid Sheff speaking with Terry Gross in two thousand Thirteen the new film beautiful boy is based on two memoirs one written by David Sheff and the other by his son Nick chef about Knicks addiction to mess and the subsequent recovery\nWere happened to update that Nick is drug free today he's married and has written two novels and scripts for to television shows", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "19"}
