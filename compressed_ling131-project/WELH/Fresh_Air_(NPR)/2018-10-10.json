I. P. R. die to work\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with ... W singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nStrip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign\nThey were hip to the importance of this what did they do so it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject to virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm this military campaign was accompanied\nBy a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the\nCampaign in twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nThen Hamas would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the proxies if one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set of model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they change by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I work clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nOriginally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the find a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving and one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serving the cause and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from uh Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlisted in an online army and get you what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swiss army of swift ease you can list in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are\nAnd by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd sources so to speak and\nOne of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion to drive it to your own ends\nThe same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army which trying hijacked discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air Dave Davies

new book like war the weaponization of social media it's about how social media has been weaponized for political campaigns uprisings and wars\nLet's talk about social media in political campaigns there's been a lot of attention paid to the Russian efforts to interfere with the twenty sixteen elections and you describe the appearance and twenty Seventeen of somebody on social media named Angie Dixon she establishes a Twitter account what was her agenda what do we know about\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict in social media was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the comment on hearing in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nUh it was in a certain way you hide both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything\n... where are they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nThat wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you had the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the double gang or a narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again and again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona is in the like\nAnd the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative be buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stylish and learn about history we kept the DEA so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian um actors go on to a PDF very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook that was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kind of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections and the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nNeural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some way surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nWonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world um and it's very powerful\nThe future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example\nThat might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on a war a certain way to challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes\nThese are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies in term are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks and so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome\nThe origin of social networks online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks like would be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane of committed something\nTo give real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave\nOr there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger to uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that and meld together to allow you to a in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson broken ...

absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I've been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region Hansen's the incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar FEMA addict terrain at least two\nTo ... and and uh but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing you know the sort of journey from the kind of intimate home life on the ground to destroy the extremes of human experience out in space\nSea off the set you look out

shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film it is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we serve would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle\nThe bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them but this is this is a piece by piece a hand built\nMachine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts arts something better just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nNational puts together a press state meant about the ... of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't forget they Donald national preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a band of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGiven Heinz who plays ... the whole date is is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the\nWillingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a line in the in the speeches says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon\nWill know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intended that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures or could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil if Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was writing has a dictionary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people of\nMy ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and whiplash

on the lunar surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what himself would be seeing as you first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or who's an sort of plan to walk off to the little west grader during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from many cameras are and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think there were really important to us in terms of in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase you not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nMy guest is Damien ... he directed

Gosling as Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ... [noise]\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing and my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay yeah so it's\n... piece called lunar Rhapsody yep and what I find really interesting about that is is that you know this comes under the category about of of the genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like\nIf I may describe it this way with all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices a therapy and this incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate\nVersion of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually seen the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked distracted and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the\nTrack itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and so the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a ... a listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly\nPlay distracted really no one\nListening knowing image control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nIdea why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called women or Rhapsody [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nOh uh oh\n[noise]\n\n\nI'm uh [noise]\nAt the interactivity which Neil Armstrong played on late afternoon and accused in the new movie first manned missions directed by ... lesser directed land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and they found remarkable was that you were working on land before first man but a lot of land with a turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man er and er so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know ...\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim and sending a fell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be in\nReally interesting and ah by the way also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical scripted and I said oh yeah you like musicals so the I Love Gene Kelly and we talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and it was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joy and the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real ... and then miniatures it's it's\nIt's you know la la land was a complex film but that's because of like the choreography in the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like technically difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I uh I think everything you described gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were ah going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I haven't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nThey mentioned bell thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our shown congratulations and thank you\nSo nice to
