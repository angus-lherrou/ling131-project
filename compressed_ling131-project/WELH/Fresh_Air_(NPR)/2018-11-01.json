G. slash the butler [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross\nThe Supreme Court has changed during the Trump Administration the court now has to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch replace the late Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell block President Obama from choosing Scully a successor and Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justice is my guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful\nIt also includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as past justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict how each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and during for example the recent cabinet confirmation hearings you her questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justice to decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left\nTo the political branches cheaply means Congress or state legislatures and they do so for a variety of reasons but I I think the thread that runs through [noise]\nThe views of most justices most of the time and I interviewed a majority of them for this book I interviewed them on background and I can indicate which ones I interview that was the terms of the deal I the attitude you get is if not us who will do show some will look out the window in point of the capital\nAnd say look at the dysfunctional Congress they'll make reference is veiled and otherwise to the presidency of these days\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece\nI think that in some respects a leaves him in an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true\nPartisan shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases you think that might influence\nYou could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAre are there Republican interest or their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving said all that they are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of a sexual\nUm and say that Thomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February there was a New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who\nHad stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas so it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was truly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back\nTo light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige\nI think it helps to uh in feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act this 'cause they know that the justices across the street\nWill act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with a with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm\nPresident Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in the case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was or not the ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him\nIs misguided one of the great aspects of the system which has lots of flaws is that once you're on the bench have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can do anything\nAt that point other than tweet so I think\nBy and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remain friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and you say some movement conserve it\nA ... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course ... nomination why was he ... to lack that's\nAll they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives wanted instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be sharing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we don't I Will go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinion saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst them now I happen to think that cabin on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nHave been or that Gorsuch will be I Would predict the capital will be closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional is him his affection\nFor the court and for its own reputation may lead him in ... on some occasions to rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively show\nThe Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then ... in that direction than for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David a caplin former legal affairs

the Supreme Court for a decade\nHe's the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution which happened about how the Supreme Court became so politicized how it became so powerful\nAnd how it's changed during the Trump Administration with the addition of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd from west in hotels and resorts west and is

western dot com this is fresh\nAir and if you're just joining us guest is David Kaplan author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia who was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means are interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a texture list I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is ...\nOr ... or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they would both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a um trope\nIs that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no clause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me\nBased on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nLet's do something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights you say that originalism favor as\nA status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents were senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because of the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen\nBecause of their stellar credentials those were unnecessary requirement for getting chosen they were chosen because I thought they vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that was made against ... was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved so often it raises the stakes\nOf who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues\nThen you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't always that way when John Paul Stevens\nWas picked by Gerald Ford\nIn the mid Nineteen seventies and it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees that includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together and they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court\nPack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House and twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court just add to more seats a point to liberals then eleven member court you have a six foot majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your theater Ginsburg now eighty five and how old was a jump hosts Stevens when he left Ninety\nYeah so ... you can say for a really long time um\nSo a lot of people already ... it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah\n[laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\nUm the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was ... cousin part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise]\nUm so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have\nWell would lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single\nTerm of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I endorse\nI think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make courage justices leave it would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen [noise]\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country if it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be a nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve then you might\nActually give forced to the idea\nThat the court as a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice but that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority the system might look\nMore like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not\nA new issue it's just far more dramatic than it used to be and it cuts against what we all learned in civics class which is that the law is supposed to be neutral where government of laws not men and women and so forth having said all that\nBut they have a Kevin thank you so much for talking with us it's a pleasure thanks for having me David Kaplan is the author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme
