I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well in your movie was that your ...\nI actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I Love Dennis O'Hara who played Dr ... and uh he it's a weird job because there's a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about the fertility industry\nUm because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine ... character is a writer\nAnd she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies\nAnd her her agent costs her and said have you seen the cover and Catherine Hans has no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of Catherine has a feminist and\nAn undercover there's a woman and it's like white flowing dress in a field of like purple and green and\nIt's so quote feminine and like old fashioned feminine and so she's mortified and so here's the conversation she has with her husband afterwards a who's played by Paul Giamatti I should mention that as they're attacking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAs ... or what\nIn college is sending its ideology ally that I didn't have a career in in ... panned out just send them the bills for our eyes and I have yes\nYou can play second wave feminism for our ambivalent about having a ... [noise]\nDon't know you're not because you realize that the voters leaving the dog but\nBefore you kept changing the deadline is remember\nOh we'll start as soon as I finish to play or\nRight after I get the story published finished the book\nHe blaming me knowing awful oh I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation\nA lot of women have famous hit forty one I thought I could to [noise]\nI just don't think it's Florida's thumbs falls if we can't get pregnant [noise]\nI guess it is mine too busy writing my stupid but [noise]\nI didn't say that all the doctors that we're talking about it's my it's\nBad for the turtle a my old egg and one of the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise your sperm like\nWhoa whoa whoa what so suppose nothing\nSo that was Catherine ... and Paul Giamatti and a scene from my guess timer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nSo did you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in your own mind yeah\nYou mean blaming myself yeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my and get her on in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was\nI think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of a leap to that and I said you know it's butter and this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why\nShe feels betrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori signed ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed\nBut I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nAh to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly she feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um\nSimply not available to her I think for a lot of\nWomen when you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nAway from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of becoming\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really you know that marriage and\nHaving babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but that combined with the you know pursuing a\nCareer in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was a performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided that does go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe\nOther than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his suit and hadn't had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing\nUm in part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nEven depict him as the appreciative type [noise]\nI'm right and there isn't a strange men need between you between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so that is unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent at during that time has made you so focused on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and um we you know didn't\nLive with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we\nWe did a lot [laughter] what what is your Mother's Day arrangements um when I was a teenager or at that point I had like I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living and my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um she was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid a tangible than I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard\n... became our parent he paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother [laughter]\nYou know getting a PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in um um and then when we lived with my mother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and\nThere was never food in the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail through like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on the ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off mass of mhm so what was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at this you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that said even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]\nWhatever Jenkins it's great to have you

small family farmers\nDo we have any idea who the hackers were or why they did this\nYeah so the short answer Jeremy's that we don't really know yet are there have been questions about Russia there's obviously a history there with Facebook as it relates to the presidential election so people have been a sort of talking about the possibility of a state actor state sponsored hacking here\nUm but we just don't really know who's behind this yet um we know that actual count passwords and credit card information stored on Facebook by users was not taken\nBut a lot of personal information like names and phone numbers apparently was so that's the kind of information that can fetch a nice price on the dark Web or other marketplaces where hackers and even some marketing companies buy and sell information on users for a number of purposes\nOr identity theft but also the ability to spam potentially millions of people might go a long way for and unscrupulous marketing from\nOne piece of advice I saw as a result of this was that you shouldn't use your Facebook a log in to log into other sites which they often ask you do you want to log in or do you want to log in via Facebook and that that might protect you a little bit are there any piece of advice you have for people and how they can protect themselves\nYeah this is a really good question and yes they did it affect other accounts that you might use Facebook to log in to you and Facebook has made a big push to be the kind of single logging system for the Web\nJeremy my suggestion is always a use a password manager rather than trusting your password credentials for multiple places on the Web where you might store financial information or other personal information\nDon't trust a a tech platform to do that necessarily unless it is specifically a security tech platform like a password manager\nOkay there's another big story happening at Facebook which is that some of the big names are leaving the two founders of Instagram just left a Facebook after differences with Mark Zuckerberg or about how to run Instagram which Facebook acquired back in twenty twelve WhatsApp cofounder also recently\nDeparted Facebook Facebook bought WhatsApp for twenty two billion dollars back in twenty fourteen what's going on\nHere [noise] yeah so these are these are two different stories obviously but they have some uh some cross over and some similarities one of the interesting things about Facebook is that it's you know it's one of the only big platforms that truly requires you to present as who you are\nA it's difficult to be anonymous there that's an important part of Facebook's design and then the fundamental way this goes against the idea of privacy online right\nAnd I think both of these stories are connected to that so I Would the case of the uh Instagram co founders\nThese two men are left the company in part because Instagram is such an important a key part of Facebook's a future revenue um the company really is starting to try to change Instagram to be more friendly to advertising and this apparently it was part of the departure there\nUm when it comes to what's that you know it's another sort of unique story but again it's about privacy and ah and about the founder kind of having different ideas than Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook about what what's that should be used for and how it should make money\nYou too right the ship at this moment I I'm just looking at their two year stock price yes it went up and up and up and up until July and then just fell right down I mean it hasn't gone all the way down to where it was back in early twenties Seventeen but it's not looking good right now yeah\nSo everything we know about platforms is that most of them go away over time right new generations of users often want or build the platforms for themselves um Facebook school maybe to connect to everyone but teenagers don't necessarily want to be connected with grandma and dad on Facebook right\nAnd this is why I think I object in the past that Facebook might be the next my space or the companies seem to have a two pronged approach right now or retain Facebook users and the revenue they generate and make its both on start ups like what's happening Instagram generate more revenue\nUm but it's important to remember that that while its growth is slowing and the U.S and Canada Facebook is aggressively focused on growth overseas and there are people in emerging markets whose entire experience of the Internet use Facebook so I I wouldn't count out the world's biggest social media platform just yeah\nYeah I don't think that we can say that Facebook will ever be the next my space because my space never had two billion users here that the area [laughter] Ben Johnson who

Washington ... nothing new here says the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee\nAfter seeing a new FBI report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the report was requested to investigate sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh NPR's Brian Naylor has more\nRepublican Senator Chuck Grassley says in his words there is nothing in it that we didn't already know that neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations\nHave it all has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women including Christine Blasey Ford who testified under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her well both were in high school the FBI was ordered to investigate that accusation and others\nThe bureau interviewed nine individuals the White House source tells NPR the Senate could begin voting on the Kavanaugh nomination as soon as friday Brian Naylor NPR News Washington\nThe confidential FBI into cheerios are available to senators in a secure room at the Capitol Senate Democrats continue to insist that the FBI review of new charges was too narrow here's top Judiciary Committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein\nDemocrat agreed that the investigation so should be limited\nWe do not agree that the White House should tie the FBI's hands it's simply not credible\nTo say that public testimony in last week's hearing as a substitute for interviews by FBI agents not only to senators lack the expertise of FBI agents we were only given five minutes to questions judge Kavanaugh\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is of the opinion that something is in the new materials\nI disagree having received this the a briefing on all of the documents I disagree with Senator Grassley statements that there was no hint of misconduct\nNine people question getting a supplementary inquiry a World Trade organization summit in a couple of weeks will take place in North America but the U.S is not invited Dan ... explains\nWashington has been left off the guest list for the two day summit because the WTO is one of the organizations derided by president Donald Trump Canada's international trade diversification minister Jim cars says ministers from Thirteen like minded countries will attend\nIt was directly a result of this decision to open themselves up as a platform because what they'd done was they'd allowed an academic research or to use some of the data\nOn the platform to build a personality quiz but then he sold back data to the political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica and that sort of back door the way in which that data went out the door\nOr has created much of the crisis that now engulf the company today\nAnd you're right that the executive within Facebook Sandy ... kill us was put in charge of looking into what these outside you know at the developers were doing with that the data that they got from the Facebook users who you know plugged into their games what did he find\nWhat he found unnerved in a semi park illicit joined Facebook in twenty eleven and was one of the people responsible for going out and figuring out whether the data that they were given to developers was being misused in any way we're\nNow where people are violating privacy where they um taking more data than they were supposed to and what he found was that they were in some cases programmers for instance were siphoning off people's pictures and they're private messages\nAre in other cases he found a developer that was building essentially shadow profiles profiles for people who've never given their consent\nUm including for children and it was you know this was a case in which there was just this feeling of it being the wild west this data was out there and nobody was paying attention and and he raised alarms internally as he tells the story what he did was he said look we need to do a a major audit\nTo go out and figure out where is our data who has an how are they using it and as he says he was told\nA that's not going to happen because if you do it you may not want to know what you're going to find meaning that they may have already lost control of so much of that\nData that they didn't really want to discover the full reach a and and Sandy ... left\nBut in in many ways his warnings turned out to be prophetic because exactly the kind of undisciplined to use the data which he had warned about and and and try to raise greater alarms about internally\nOr turned out to be the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scandal which became so I'm so consuming for the company this year\nSo a lot of resources within the company devoted to pushing growth not so much into doing it responsibly\nAll I needed engineers to help me try to police where this data was going but all of their resources we're going to growth he said at some point and he told me that the growth team had engineers coming out of their ears they had everything they wanted everything was devoted to growing and it was not devoted to making sure that what they were doing at the time was safe\n[noise] what are some of the things the company did to keep growing that kind of pushed the boundaries of privacy\nWell they begin to build in lots of ingenious details into the design of the site things like a auto played video this is something as simple as\nChanging the nature of Facebook so that when you scroll down your page that the videos would begin to play without you having to click on them what that was was essentially taking advantage of\nSome of our own psychological wiring that means that just eliminating that small obstacle makes much more likely to stay on the site to watch that and ultimately to consume whatever advertising is around it\nAnd they did other things they for instance you know you remember the very beginning Facebook used to have pages single pages you'd have to click onto the next page they got rid of that so it's just a continuous scroll\nAnd all of these little tiny details um\nWe're in a way making Facebook into a new generation of behavioral experts they figured out how to you tweak people's vanities and their passions and their susceptibility and their desires in order to keep them on the site the most important thing Facebook could do\nAnd this is how they measured it was made sure that people were\n... were signing on and staying on whenever you joined the company in your orientation you were taught about something very important metric known as el six or seven\nWhich means the number of people who logged in six of the last seven days and whatever you could do to try to raise that el six or seven that was the priority [noise]\nUm but as somebody put it to me\nThe problem with that is that eventually you exhaust the positive ways of boosting that engagement and eventually you start to look at what this person described as the dark patterns\nThe ways that you can use anxiety or vanity or to try to get people to sign on one of the things they discovered for instance was if you send somebody an email that says\nThat a Facebook friend has uploaded a picture of them to Facebook that people are almost incapable of resisting the temptation to look um and that sort of tweak that just minor behavioral nudge turned out to be um really hugely important to the growth and Facebook\nHave

with journalism alliance [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with New Yorker staff writer as an awesome as he has a piece in the magazine called ghost in the machine about Martin Zucker burg and Facebook and its current controversies it's in a recent issue\nNow Facebook isn't a lot of trouble these days because of data breaches it its role in elections but you're right that some form or Facebook executives are voicing doubts about the company's role for other things are exacerbating isolation outrage addictive behaviors and give us an example\nThis is a big change for Facebook traditionally it's former executives have been silent they leave the company and and very often don't say much about it\nBooks first president he's as sort of well known Silicon Valley figure um gave an interview in which he said that as he put it he's become a conscientious objector to social media you said God Knows what it's doing to our children's\nBrains and and then a few days later there was another very prominent former Facebook executive named ... who had been the head of growth a vice president of user growth which was an absolutely central position at the company for a number of years and he came out and said\nYou know in the back of our mind we all had a sense that something might be going wrong with our product the thing that we were building I'm paraphrasing here was as he put it contributing to the breakdown of social discourse the breakdown of society and he said he would never let his children use this kind of\nProduct I think because the public face of the company has been so on message about how they contribute in their minds to doing good in the world to have some very senior former executive come out and talk about what the public has come to believe which is that there are these very serious side effects\nTo the company's growth was a real wakeup call externally and I think somewhat internally yes\nSide effects in terms of increasing you know social tensions in some cases violent political activity what about isolation addictive behaviors\nThere has been a growing body of research that shows a and it's been published in sort of the major scientific an academic journals that there is a correlation in some cases between heavy Facebook use and decreased sense of wellbeing a sense of connection people feel lonely\nThere is a lot that they're trying to figure out about this but it's gotten to the point where the data is Annette ... and the company has been done to acknowledge it hurt for the first time early this year\nThat Facebook said look we recognize that there are different ways that you can use this and if you're just using it passively if you're just sitting there scrolling would glazed eyes hour after hour we recognize this is not good for you\nAnd so what they did is they said we're going to try to change it a bit so that people are more actively engaged so that they're you know talking to friends actively communicating with their family members and stuff like that but that was a key\nDifference from how they used to talk about it which was that if you didn't agree with the fundamental premise that Facebook was basically good than it was a kind of heresy and they wouldn't want to have the conversation they are now slowly acclimated to the idea that people just don't buy that anymore you know you talk\nTo ... a fair amount about this you know pushing the boundaries of privacy to grow that as he regard this kind of experimentation\nHe absorbed a central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he has an and some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we're doing something in ... intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a uh to to get out into the world\nI'm very often what he came to believe was that they would criticize him at the time but it overtime eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nWho can solve the problem he ... he said that they are going to have over a hundred people a Burmese speakers who are going to be policing a the a Facebook in ... but I think it speaks to a broader a broader\nDynamic at work here with which is that for a long time as one of march afterwards friends said to me when there were complaints about the company\nHe either thought that these were just LED lights these were people who are slow to embrace technology or in other cases they were exaggerating are overstating the role that Facebook was playing he looked at a place like me and Martin said well they were probably going to be fighting anyway I'm I'm putting words in his mouth or this or not words he said to me\nBut I think over time he has come to this realization and by his own description of belated realization that Facebook is not just a tool on the table is not just an of a new implement it is in fact a fundamental and very ... by its nature it has\nTo be responsible for the forces that it on leashes [noise]\nUm but then building the systems to try to get control of this\nIs is hard and they have moved much more slowly than they should have a in some cases by their own admission\nLet's talk about the twenty sixteen elections did Facebook was when the election was approaching see this as a big revenue opportunity they did\nSaw this as a an important moment they Sheryl Sandberg and call with investors and analysts\nCompared it to the world cup or the super bowl with a cave operating officer of you know she is yeah she's sort of arguably the second most powerful person at Facebook and and and what she said was this was going to be a major opportunity for them to sell ads a political\nThe candidates and political organizations became more aware of the importance of the Internet that they were going to shift a lot of their spending from television into the Internet and that that you were going to see a a nine or ten fold increase in how much spending was going to be available and Facebook want it to be a big recipient of that\nRight and and it had gotten the special exemption 'em to print ads which didn't disclose who paid for them right so so that was kind of a wide open opportunity\nYeah Facebook had used its lobbying power it had\nUm it had argued to the federal election commission that it should be exempted from rules that require television advertising to be identified by the source of the funding that point at the end where they say who who paid for the ... they said we shouldn't have to follow those rules because we're a new technology and in their filings they said you don't want to stifle the growth of new\nInnovation but as a result that meant that it was in a sense a very dark terrain that things that were being posted on Facebook that were ads are around politics were in many cases of mysterious orange and it was very hard to know who was pushing them and why\nAnd Facebook offered to embed Facebook employee with both the Clinton and Trump campaigns to help the campaigns use the platform effectively how did they respond\nWith the Clinton campaign or rejected the offer 'em\nThey thought they had more or less enough of their own technical capability to do it but the Trump campaign embrace it eagerly they were much smaller almost sort of shoestring operation they had very little uh of the season political expertise that was rallying around other presidential candidates\nAnd so Facebook moved employees into the Trump campaign headquarters and they helped some craft their messages they help them figure out how to reach the largest possible audience how to\nTest different messages many many messages a day um to figure out just what small differences changing the background color or changing the texture the font\nHow that would impact the number of people that would click on it and ultimately might give money and support the candidate so later in the end when after Donald Trump won the election the senior campaign strategist were very clear as one of them Teresa ... said\nTo an interviewer without Facebook we would not have won they played an absolutely essential role in the process\nHow did the Trump campaign itself you use the platform to affect things like turn up\nBut one of the things they did was the Trump campaign bought an ad campaign on Facebook that was designed to suppress turnout among constituencies that they expected to be important to the Democrats including African Americans and young liberals and and white women and\nBite bite targeting that population using these incredibly powerful tools or persuasion that Facebook has which are really we have been engineered to to optimize to to get people to respond I'm\nIn the view of the Trump campaign that was an important piece of their\nSuccess and they've talked about it ever since

Bergen Facebook ghost in the machine was in a recent issue of the magazine\nSo when word began to emerge about the spread of a false information on Facebook or some of it by ... by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency and Russia um how did soccer bird respond to this\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might have affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were in [noise]\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here\nI'm over time they have come to understand that that's simply not the case they\nInitially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin\nHad fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project and yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout\nTheir powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not had\nThis dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction right\nUm and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's right um so ... who was in big trouble ...\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do\nWell there was a lot riding on that appearance ah you know in many ways a kind of felt like a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and it was growing calls for regulation and\nHe\nSome ways is vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point Orrin Hatch senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\n... kind of 'em gave a little smile and said Senate\nTo anybody who's paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies and Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]", "show_name":
