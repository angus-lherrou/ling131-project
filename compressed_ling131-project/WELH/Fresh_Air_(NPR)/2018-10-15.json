relationship\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years they're near oh okay okay I Know what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women some people of color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um\n[noise] that can be\nI think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done\nThey're hanging out that you do I think you can feel sort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men and the audience\n[noise] yeah I mean I think he just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can ... is that allowed\nNow have to believe it too so why bother\nI don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\nI'm Sorry I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why why tore across America and we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been down in ourselves this whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we\nHave different energy that a lot of the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell her jokes in a different way or different style and we were beating ourselves up in allowing that sort of\nIs to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or a culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have laughed and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a ... queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally messed it up I couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura she doesn't know\nShe's a she just wakes up and she has ... ... ... like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that make me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and\nAll these sort of shows where you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I can kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning for not attractive to straight do than for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards mhm is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer was no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that soft outcome and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in the house\nIs not about a number if you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than\nI I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans I feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ... I Know that\nBut there there'll be like oh yeah we have a size four and it's like that is unacceptable to me to only have a size four is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people\nI'm a ten twelve that's just what it is and they'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you\nIt's like how dare you be like oh well we couldn't find anything in your size you didn't look 'cause I dress myself every day [laughter] yeah I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need to have this sort of oh well we only have a zero to four so you either ... or ...\nAnybody I Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into and every time I didn't fit into something I'd be like I'm Sorry\nAnd the Apollo time I would apologize after every single offered in ... I'm so sorry and my they knew what size I was four weeks before I showed up I is not my fault I'm decides that I Am [noise]\nThere's an afterword and it didn't come to your book in part of your book

your amazing\nAnd then that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we will have this happy life together and so that was one of the biggest lessons was like not looking for this great relationship to sort\nOf define me or make me realize that I'm lovable\nI just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I had been like found my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never once they check and see how I felt about myself\nDid you have to learn how to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go into a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um I just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the experience absolutely\nI mean I I did all that stuff where I just always think like you go out to like a diner or a movie go by yourself and you think everyone is just like dropping the ... arrest right everyone's dropping therefore cars are going there is a woman singled out by herself\nAnd they're all like focus on their ... they are not thinking about you you know and it was just was so sort of like self absorbed Ron Mike everyone's judge me for being single and yes there are certain people and everyone's lives will like judge them for being single but it was just kind of like\nWho cares

what happens in short order to escape attempts here are successful\nWash breaks away from that plantation the hot air balloon no less\nAnd ... also breaks away in her case leaving behind the confines of the conventional historical novel and transporting readers into the ... the realms of romantic era travelogue and scientific exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium of fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation\nThe new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage\nHis younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights he turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nTo pitch in lists wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that washed possesses a skill for executing detailed scientific drawings\nAcross the color line the to strike up a kind of friendship\nSo much so that when it seems likely that watch will be killed in wrongful retaliation for the death of a white visitor to the plantation\nTeach fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment\nThe air grew colder correct in webs across my skin all was shadow red light storm fire and frenzy and up we went into the eye of it untouched miraculous\nIf only that escape or the soaring conclusion to wash his adventures not just the beginning\nBut inevitably the friends that attempt to float above the consequences of race springs elite and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ... ingenious story telling gifts but her name\n[noise] washes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from pitch elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to later exhibit\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science is the great equalizer watch says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence above categories as she tries to do for her hero watch and see huge and clearly aims to carry her readers up up

one candidate is prestigious literary award the dealer prize she spoke with fresh air producer Sam brother\nHas to be a huge and welcome to fresh air\n[noise] Hi I'm really pleased to be here\nOn the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm\nNot a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a you know there were expendable so that the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher [noise]\nThe ah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite artistic to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field worker on the plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the man house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nBut the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant merely just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes live forever because a bond forms between him and this is what it meant to catch\n'em and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in this than this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nAnd that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrows stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty in itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him with his natural gifts like he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man is just completely [noise] you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a a good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch\nBought some you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a ... character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get them to help them if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his\nA philosophy a adult life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy in his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll washes scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people can persuade them slit the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that some ... for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in light and ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of themselves as being quite a moral person and\nThen he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place in in the world but he's not really thinking about the fact that\nYou know for all of his scientific pursuits this is being funded by slavery a and he's kind of turned a blind eye to that and so he's profoundly affected by it because he wouldn't be able to do what he does a without that a dark commerce going on", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "15"}
