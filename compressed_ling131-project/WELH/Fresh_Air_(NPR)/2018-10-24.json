R. G. slashed the Bible or\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross we're about to have perhaps the most important midterm election of our time the outcome will determine who controls the house and the Senate in this very divisive era as well as who governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the ... election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cutbacks to early voting and aggressive purging voters\nSince plenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose it policy which removes people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough\nIn Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering and I guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones reporting fellow of the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election\nTwenty four states have implemented new restrictions on voting so nearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws\nTo do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote or to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now and the twentieth elections\nIn critical states like Georgia North Dakota Kansas et cetera\nWhere there are very close elections\nSo is it a coincidence that all of this is happening [noise]\nNot a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party\nAfter the two thousand eight election when Republicans gained control of a number of really important states in twenty ten\nThey began to introduce a wave of new restrictions to tighten access to the ballot then those efforts were basically given a green light by the Supreme Court when it removed a critical part of the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen and the Shelby County versus hold her decision\nInstead of those states with the longest histories of discrimination no longer had to approve their voting changes with the federal government that allowed states in the south that previously had to approve their voting changes with the federal government places like Texas and Georgia North Carolina an Alabama to implement these new restrictions on voting so I think you're seeing now\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nNot just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been a leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case\nFor restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act that did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or\nThis law blocked one in seven cans oh almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state's the federal court actually struck that law down\nEarlier this year and said that there was almost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote\nThat part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed in Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobach only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in Kobach favor\nAnd the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nReduce turn out by ... percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally in twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called back due to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd ... had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted illegally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim\nAnd showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nKoh Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted to legally\nKris Kobach has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is a voting issue Kodak advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it used to draw districts for state legislatures it used to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine how many electoral votes each state has so the census has instrumental when it comes to voting\nAnd what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time and the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he\nNow in his words the illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I I don't want to get to tactical hear Teri but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted\nWhen it comes to drawn a district and deciding what level representation an area should have what Kobach wants to do is restrict those districts\nTo only counting people who are citizens if you did that\nAreas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California\nWould have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way\nDistricts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking areas of lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live\nWill get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and accurate census\nSo where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York\nAnd sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the centrist is unfair if the census is inaccurate and so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and inaccurate as well\nMy guess is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones\nAfter a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression in voting rights\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment

Ari Berman about voting rights and voting restrictions which may influence the outcome of the midterms in this key election he's the author of the book give us the ballot for modern struggle for voting rights in America\nAnd he's a senior writer for Mother Jones we've been looking at some of the states that have added the most consequential restrictions [noise]\nThat would be the largest in franchise met of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas and other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent the mouse and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons Charlie Crist Jeb\nFive thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida during his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised\nAfrican Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have\nBeen appealed as high as the Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh not to the bench what's his position on voting rights\nHe has from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights\nHe upheld a voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but Calvin I wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence of the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court are ready this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the twenty Eighteen election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights [noise]\nAmazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread or pervasive in his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia orange days that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act\nMore protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically are going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fraud how pervasive hasn't then\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent\nBut incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's very difficult to commit fraud in New York what we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York in the state without a voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their addresses I'd have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine\nAnd I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that so it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most\nAnd so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or see\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is journalist Ari Berman is the author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's also a senior reporter for Mother Jones who's been reporting extensively on the latest developments in voting issues will be right back this

extensively on voting issue as\nIf you consider this wave of voter restrictions to be part of a larger Republican strategy\nWhat's the starting point for you is there is there like a starting point or a group or a person that you see as having um you know lead this or or or be done it\nYou know I date the contemporary effort to restrict the voting rights back to the two thousand election in Florida because everyone knows about hanging chads and butterfly ballots and an all the problems that we saw that election but there was a massive voter purge that was\nDuring the two thousand election and Florida was one of them's only a few states have prevented ex felons from voting and so what the state did is they purged thousands of people\nFrom the voter rolls and they said that an ex felons were registered in large numbers and had to be removed from the rolls while this voter purge was very inaccurate it was also discriminatory African Americans in Florida eleven percent of the electorate but forty four percent of those on the voter purge list\nAnd what happened is people showed up on election day they were wrongly told they were felons and they were prevented from voting and this was overshadowed by the hanging chads and the butterfly ballots and all of that but after the two thousand election to end up ... sued the state of Florida and the state\nConceded that twelve thousand registered voters who are disproportionately African American\nWere purged from the voting rolls and I'm able to vote because they were wrongly labeled as ex felons and that number of people purge was twenty two times\nGeorge W. Bush has five hundred and thirty seven vote margin of victory I think coming out of the two thousand election Florida we said this could never happen again we could never have these kind of voting problems but I think elements of the Republican Party however saw different strategy\nThe public radio dot org [noise]\n\nFrom WHYY in Philadelphia I'm Terry Gross with fresh air\nWe share with

evangelical preacher in a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nUm there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also an incredible capitalist who comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and he become antagonists and in in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you and your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parenthetically\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another uh oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sense him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they less\nSugar here well what are you sure\nThe laws cages you Julie I'm going to result right\nYou're gone on\n\nDo a musher [noise]\nCome here and you wrote and grows

be blood\nI'm actually mentioned you are the slapping sounds that you're hearing at the end of that scene that's Paul ... character like slapping the devil slapping the devil out of Daniel Day Lewis a U.S so getting even with Daniel Day Lewis was\nBeating them up earlier in in the film that that she and it's almost like this incredible operatic do wet did you think of it that way when you're making it [noise]\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know that it's time for me I I'm I was sort of cast the last minute and this and I started about four days after I was cast in this part\nYou initially cast as the preachers brother\nYeah and then they moved due to be yeah the the teen preacher is that why those two characters became became twins were they not twins we're there were just brother they're just brother but now that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger\nPart yeah I should I suppose so but you know ... so I mean sort of sort of why it was going back there is is just listening that quip you know give me I'm a feeling which was I just remember the last two days before I started\nSpending went up to sun down in that church alone um you know he lives church and\nThat was a really sort of um beautiful couple of days just sort of trying to learn the script and make contact with the ... the character and in in in this empty church I don't know why that's when I went back to\nLose your idea to to learn your part while sitting in the church\nWhile I was just suddenly on location and I was like what okay how well they want us Monday and okay I'm going to go to the church and learn like seems um [noise] it's funny because that quip to quite a long scenes so that was a sort of seeing me film for all all day long and uh\nI Believe our first set up was probably some kind of wider maybe some kind of master shop and uh I I slapped Daniel as you said and towards the end of the scene and I think we were supposed to once we get that part just stop you know 'cause we're we're going to be doing this all day and\nAnd I remember ah the first take forgetting and just slapping him many times and as soon as we cut I remembered that I was supposed to stop and I went oh God um and I think I'd ...

I think there were things that I was aware of that I felt like I don't know if that's the healthiest um\nBut money celebrity exactly in their bubble\nYeah and I\nWhich we don't often talk about 'cause it's not what we can somebody's interested in but like friends and music or like basketball you know like that that's an important balance point you know to to who I Am so I just didn't want to be around all actors that the simplest way to put it 'cause I was already a big part of my life so [noise]\nUm I went to college is an English major basically to kind of double check like hey let's let's make sure that you're just you know the the the trains already moving I Need is you know I could get off so to speak um I'd already done a film called LIE when I was sixteen\nIt did well for an independent film\nI was lucky to have an agent you know and and to sort of have a one little foot in the door\nBut I needed to know\nThat it was me and my choice a sort of studying something else being into looted poet for a moment or you know reading the great Russian novels or whatever\nKind of helped me you know go okay you know what actually I miss [laughter] you know that and I like it and I want to do it and and frankly it was getting the part in a film called the balance jak and rose\nWhen I was Eighteen we someone when I was Nineteen that Daniel Day Lewis is in and that was the first time on film I got to play a character that was not my ... like myself so to speak I just done a couple of part was like a dorky glasses which I you know sort of and in real life and\nI felt like I don't that's not acting to me like I don't want to just be a version of myself and I was worried because I didn't know yet that you had a choice to say yes or no part\nIn getting somebody believing in me to play this part and ... maybe go oh I can be an actor like this is what I Want\nTo I was reading an interview with your partner ... than and congratulations you both have a little baby now [laughter] [noise]\nUm and and she was comparing some of the gender differences between her world as an actress in your world as an actor so she said nine times out of ten in a rural she has to cry and that you rarely have to cry and that once in a dish and she had to have a gun and be tough\nAnd you've had a lot of additions that if it involves guns are being tough\nA liver like I'm frustrated with the number of movies involving like guns and and and violence and\nWell yeah I Am personally you know even as a viewer and I've always myself chosen to look at it like\nThe ... part of it so yeah like a film like prisoners has violence right but I think that there's a sense of morality I actually think it's conflicted you know your lead character is\nResponding in a violent way and I don't think it's looked upon you know with shiny eyes um that's I think maybe it's okay you know I Hope I'm not just justifying it but I mean I Try to look at things and go what's the cost of this you know twelve years a slave there's a lot of violence but this is you know the story that\nThat has a value and and also frankly like actually a little squeamish even though I Do a lot of dark material emotionally I um I don't respond well to to to just pilots for violence sake you know that's not my\nUm so what does make a Swedish [laughter]\nOr blood actually and I think the older I get the worse it is actually it's not like something where you become more it actually becomes more on easy for me especially now being a parent's right like\nSeeing the first breath of life taken and to wash life expires so easily again and again you know on screen I Do think entertainment's okay though and and I just think it's about how people handle it right\nSo you know your your partner cars and just gave birth a couple of months ago um that's messy [laughter] squeamish about that\nWell I thought I Would be and I wasn't and I loved it\nHard work yeah and uh I thought it was\nAbsolutely
