sellers money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis looks at Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says I filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is is the risk you failed to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you\nAnd the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump I come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government tried to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the ... now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWhat was the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of lights a fire under me is what I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course at at every been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election and they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to do receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody to Britain in many cases when I go get get get these briefings I'm the first person to have got them\nAnd I I thought well this enterprises managing all these ... ... ... but we as a society to spend much time thinking about\nUm it's being neglected ignored and and uh is operating on the basis of ignorance so I thought what happens when you do that across a big portfolio of risk like the federal government runs and what you what happens is you\nYou amplify the wrists you increase the probability of of these risk actually causing problems\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project olive which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow among and there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on a department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem I mean it's like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a trivial had a prize the site it ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of\nOf abuse and scorn in his collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know is paying much tension because of slow moving stores and this to me you know\nWhat aspect of the fifth risk is we've got a lot of the risk that the government manages are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them\nA cleaning up or you know\nHorrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and ruin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been frost is very short term attitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration has incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle\nAnd the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that kind of level of government where things are being done with positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\n... and people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about ... three ask atomic bomb includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did you sign on the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was a ... is the biggest part of no ... and how do they get their back in the seventies\nOr Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department as an act of vengeance\nSo is there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department are and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does\nUm is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nYou're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather Prediction Center okay\nWell I'm\nSo here's the problem ah typically the person who runs NOAA has has a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but\nBut the weather prediction has gotten generally dramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nUh all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let them as if it has it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the next\nAccuweather can do it instead\nAnd that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that\nWell in the first place is the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that the these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayers you'd have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts\nBut what he's been trying to do is organized a sexually a card of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that um\nIt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public so Barry Myers\nOr had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break and Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearned more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from ...

I'm Terry Gross let's get back to my interview a journalist Michael Lewis author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adapted into films and the undoing project his new book the fifth risk looks at the federal government under President Trump\nIt seems to me are you in your book you're basically saying you could predict some of the problems that the federal government was going to have under President Trump by looking at the transition\nThe department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to engage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting an ... because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually a direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place one of the\nInsights that drops out of the work of the psychologist day an economist and Amos diversity who were studying the way people judge risk is that when you\nEspecially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking at the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poisons the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of intimacy showed you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place [noise]\nSo you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse if he's asked an eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm seeing what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability in the end and and world markets\n[noise] well I'm a big question [laughter] question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say oh the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds as causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole our money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalized and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shocked me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you could have financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable they'd be a flight out of the dollar\nA U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be you know better than gold\nQuestion and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger or the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things were were ...\nWhen they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nIf you were a sustaining number of Rhode Island public radio you were doing your part to support journalism based on research facts and integrity thank you [laughter]\nBut if you see the new credit card in the mail recently here's the board could be interrupted you get an update your credit card information ...

G.\nFlashes sustain and thank you so much for your support [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump\nA lot of the government is often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything ...\nSlows down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it's just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and I'm so lazy stupid people is it has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy change through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department the Commerce Department\nAnd I try to having exactly the same experience that political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconception but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like um this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have cut up contempt vague contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be brief can be you know they become informed about these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes is is a mission driven person they're not paid well\nUh there there 'cause they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids the people in the department of energy scientist about a passion for their particular size since they were little kids\nThey essentially it's essentially what they are all these people are firefighters are in spirit and\nThere's something really moving about groups of people who were doing what they're doing not for money but from mission uh they they have a purpose in life and it just jumped off the page I mean it jumped is jumped into my mind to dealing with a minute so I came away from it thinking\nWow I Can't believe we as a society of treated the this slice of our society these kinds of people who are really the best among us as badly as we have and\nWhat screwed up people screwed up it's screwed up that it takes a hundred and six days on average to hire someone knew where the federal government or or you don't know your budget when you're planning or that\nOr you make a flight is mistaken you you become public enemy number one but you do something really great no one pays any attention all that's really screwed up\nBut that's not their fault that's our fault\nAnd that that's that's what sort of needs to be fixed or because in a way what we're doing is wasting the greatest spirits that our society\nWell Michael Lewis quite to talk with you again thank you so much for having

I should mention that as their talking she's finishing brushing her teeth\nAs ... for what\nIn college [noise] feminist ideology ally that I could have a career in any case panned out just send them the bills for Iowa is an idea\nYou can play soccer in order to find one of them for our ambivalent about having a ... [noise]\nDon't know you're not which is you realize that the voters leaving the dog but\nBefore you jump changing the deadline is remember\nOh yeah oh we'll start as soon as I finish to play a\nLot after I get the story published finished the book\nHe blaming me knowing awful [noise] I I'm just saying that we need to take some responsibility for the situation a\nLot of women has been a hit forty one I thought I could to [noise]\nI just don't think it's Florida's starting unfolded we kept a pregnant [noise] loose follow this\nI guess it is one of the sea busy writing my stupid but [noise]\nI didn't say that all the doctors that we're talking about it's\nMy it's bad for the turtle a my old eggs in one of the middle of an idea that oh what a surprise your sperm as like\nWhoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so suppose nothing\nSo that was Catherine ... and ... and a scene from my guess Temer Jenkins new movie which is called private life\nDid you have this kind of conversation in your head [laughter] when you were trying to conceive in your early forties\nTo not did you play both parts here in your own mind\nYeah you mean blaming myself\nYeah we utilize all righty and Catherine my and Kevin hon in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was\nI think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's butter and this isn't like a rational this is a kind of upsets\nButtering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed\nBy some notion of like a you know be independent and\nYou don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be\nBlamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of like a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um\nDelayed is now possibly not available\nTo her I think for a lot of women when you're trying\nTo reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot of away from the work that you're pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWe're really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of\nBecoming I mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood\nPoint of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with the you know pursuing a\nCareer and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConsuming and not conducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live by the skin of my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seem like I said like smoking is Paul malls and she sued and hadn't had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise]\nI'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type\n'em right and there isn't a strange men need between you know between the character and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um is family and you know\nAnd wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent and during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your Mother's Day arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had like I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm\n... we moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me\nUm had been a living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe sort of save my life how did he said it because I he paid attention well then I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents and we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother [laughter] you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nSchool\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like his because dad was probably late with rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my\nShe was I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food and\nTell through like olives and things that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and ... on the ... yeah ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off massive mhm so what was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a book Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there were you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at this you're pulling the stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that that even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary in in a way all of these movies are sort of like that
