impersonation of President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by Lee Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty four teen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to lose a bank cat and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flop she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her rent or her cats that Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like Dorothy Parker Edna fervor note coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote me Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nLet's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confides her secret to jak hop a fellow alcoholic who scrape spy on charm wet and numerous scams and hustles jak is played by Richard II grant each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor\nIt wants to hold my friends of death [noise]\nQuite by accident and myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminal physician icon fathom\n... [noise] I mean [noise] embellish [noise]\nBeautiful change [noise]\nLiterary letters writers little tricks low mother says\nThis was if you're not understanding the world of elite collectible literary artifacts are supposed to be full gene pieces of paper lovers\nI Am selling to come home she goes [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the rock 'cause I get a better response most vetoed this [noise]\nYou know the only one without [laughter] Melissa McCarthy\nWelcome to fresh air and love you in this new movie so congratulations on it this isn't really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic did are way\nBut it wasn't called a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent and a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um I think it's a\nIt's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know\nPut all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh and you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the searching people at each performance does [laughter] don't have much impact\nForgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter] blend\nThe bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yeah them you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay and none of\nNone of us felt that way\nAbout it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak get into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny in kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror in the embarrassment of it\nBecause we are things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the fact of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] was going to be OK some women found it liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes because you're ... really interesting because you're saying that's\nThat's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for bathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that\nHorrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and they think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting oh no [laughter] not in real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter]\nBut the most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all costs\nThe the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash than he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do hear him say or you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra our on our kids because with all the technological advances\nOr they need to learn to use them responsibly no no when he when he said to me was he told me what language Catherine\nLanguage ... ... what they do not balls said to me unless I say it\nCan you please not talk like that Catherine music manager for her ... next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake bank commercial that's what you look like you're a big commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like to read and\nMy legs and kick you out in a jar with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner rat you corner me I Will chew through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him improving insults in that scene in it just goes on and on with more over the top insult is that something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] I never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I I didn't\nRemember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory how'd you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very\nAssertive um characters that you know I think in the heat or especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything she has to kind of ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authorities so it was a big part of that character and you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is a there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guess is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air and here's a song from the soundtrack of can you ever forgive me sun by blossom

places to perform I just loved it also because [noise] you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\n... when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nWho is one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go club to a club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does it ever worked for you is any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my job off [laughter]\nLike I just every time or something in that vein\nAnd especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of\nThing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who\nWho is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do vote soon and talk about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAnd they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times oh my God so I Know there's the light\nNot to ever not be heated\nLight that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the light man I Would have flash it at like ... yes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics and ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a well my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the ... other people's time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch might surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth and I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager\nKind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up 'cause I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking and the light kept flashing\nAnd I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I I got off to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because\nYeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles\n[noise] I think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with\nQuirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people think we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like\nAll [laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and save the guy's name I'm like\nWhy doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just ... I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to place\nI'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting or morass Nate I'm an old behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now every little\nIn ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable you know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and realize their strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time\n[laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars in the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review and new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix Wednesday this is fresh air\nAcross the country colleges are beginning to offer students nor can in case they need to reverse an opioid overdose\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic defects every ...\nOthers question if it could encourage drug use that story plus the fallout from Jamal ... this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News for starting\nUp for the public radio\nFor Narragansett Bay the women's west about a ...
