Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central as national and the first season\nThe series satirized has Hollywood and deals with issues like success and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism season five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that's a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut one season one of bull jak horsemen begins bow jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and\nHe spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of a sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then let's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rochelle\n[noise] Nineteen Ninety seven situation comedy horse in the round me or don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agreed to raise three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America Alone to air for nine seasons starts horses around ... or ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie\n[laughter] okay Raphael Bob Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\n... wearing leader you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job\nSo let's just start with a surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women's step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who is such a mess and all of our Rio and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up ... in this clip by putting Oswald is are are straight person in the scene\nAnd yeah when the allegations are against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of a family sitcom\nWell the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant ... illustrator and cartoonist and I'd have been friends with her since high school I mean when I was you know ... in Los Angeles pitching shows around um she was living in Brooklyn at the time and one thing she was ...\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt at a plausible deniability or he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so despondent despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue bow jacks mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dimension and low tech does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her\nSo he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side and he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in his family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was mean to his mother and they were both mean to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part\nOf his eulogy and this is will or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horse around\nHeld it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named ...\nAnd it was about these orphans and early on the network at a note maybe don't mention they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted\nSomething to long for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Libya is birth mother comes to town she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she was to be in a live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the stress to water be careful\nLoves to have a way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous when the mom says she's moving to California Bolivia decides to go with her\nThe network really juiced because there is Olivia gone for good but of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and they had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. out of the cast stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horsing around dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to um what made you think about that well\nYou know I I I think the big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption\nAnd I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least a ... a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement which sounds so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the series or you you and the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people\nIf we give these that we watch\nOr but we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad to slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and the rate was kind of like ... back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that\nAnd then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we're forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for\nYears and years what makes you think that people are being forgiving again well\nUh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable\nThat it still feels like we are not you know Louis CK a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nAnd I guess since ... Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series boot camp horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one\nAnd marine car again will review a new collection of Eleanor Roosevelt advice columns I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men\nStarring John Slattery Amanda peaceful rise or and Catherine ... a new episode every Friday on prime video and from Rhodes Scholar and not for profit offering learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at our oh eighty scholar dot org slash retreats\n\nFresh air continues at the moment than a town it's news from the b._b._c. world circus as soon as the public radio eighty nine point three FM an HD WNPR Newport also wanted to point seven ...

Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series bow jak horsemen it's a satire about Hollywood success or failure depression addiction\nAnd the human condition in general although many of the characters are not human they're attacking animals with human characteristics\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even\nAfter a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews and never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in\nUm she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of ... that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah was\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end to the misfit toys or heart go I'm just so very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect we to him being\nLiving in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture a hundred\nPercent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated times now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me\nWho are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nNow you said it because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years it'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was it difficult for you to concentrate in long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested me I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in it\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't\nNobody was asked inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize was inappropriate\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my pants or everyone can see my underpants\nInappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're pushing the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was\nYou know or just a shouting out stuff in the middle class if I had a funny\nJoke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to say this thing so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference between you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing there for you or this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not\nQuite sure what was TV like a safe space for you or you could like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references\nAnd blow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nSaid made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all of a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it's a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for it by putting into the story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central as his running bow jak which has Netflix theories now the comedy central is rain yet starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect ... like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYou know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks and making under the right time for Comedy Central and you know we're obviously want them to keep their\nDignity as an episode of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for touch one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out um but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing that looks will embrace it\nThey will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWell it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt was my pleasure thank you so

of is no frills homes that he was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nThe Henry Ford of um of building in Brooklyn and queens and his uh and so he had an enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialize in\nTapping into this wave of federal housing subsidies that began to build in the thirties and forties and especially with the return of itchy eyes from World war two and a few would become one of the nation's biggest recipients of cheap\nFederal loans to build middle class but housing and so at his peak this is a guy who\nNarrative think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forces president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote or a remarkable investigative\nPiece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had and that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how\nDonald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air [noise]\nServing in Rhode Island and the southeastern Massachusetts this is the public radio eighty nine points free F our\nReporting on south coast communities is that they should have a vote public radio\nAnd ... of journalism alliance [noise]\nSunshine very windy today at a high only in my mid forties [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars cleats two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also is the ... in many cases um these were loans that were never repaired human he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run two two for Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase when she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch I'm so was a really steady stream it went well beyond\nYou know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then being off to raise\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah she use the money for ... ...\nThat he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City and elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn debt and this is the time he not only the bags hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to do was father at these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments\nThat also see that when he fell and then when he would fall down ... was there for Trump safety net was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nAnd the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was ... and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will sexually and do well and it was caught a soldier the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald list the soil executor for Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family what he did\n[noise] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... live\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this as an attempt by his um to Jane complete control over his estate and potentially to use\nThe ... the empire that Fred Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after our break we'll talk about

that's progressive\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters says and crab and David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published a long investigative article this month but ... use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why does Donald Trump make that decision\n[noise] so the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe sold it in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a chalk\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo so that the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death I Hope that it also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much his old empire and it sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer named ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that that empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down as Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion skiing how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely get away with it so it's true that the or else actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that we're describing the story in fact they are as ours did\nThe low valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nAvoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just an estate tax returns\n[noise] um since then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the\nShow based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals on public I'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or another comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie\nNegotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a ... a few weeks of the publication of this book so happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTax schemes that we describe in the story so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually costs twice perfectly with the moment when he's just taken possession\nOf twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of the comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the sun money money money might not happen in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from ... and yet when you watch not opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the Mets have how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making ability\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald\nTrump is still putting forward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into his\n... ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed to go you know [laughter]\nWe uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come into it one day with a with a little vacuum and and\n[laughter] because of it but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for a year um with ah yeah that's a pretty messy [laughter] I don't go ride them they're\nA little claustrophobic Shiite imagine [laughter] other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise] um\nIf people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it Suzanne ... David Barstow thank you so much\nIt will come thank you thank you\nSuzanne ... and David Barstow our reporters to the New York times article reported with Russ Buettner about the suspect tax schemes used a transfer of wealth from Fred Trump to his children was published earlier this month in the New York times magazine\nComing up can tackle reviews the new album by Eric Church who performed in Vegas at the concert whereas shooter opened fire on the audience\nIs is fresh air join us for a debate between the candidates for United States senator in Rhode Island", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "18"}
