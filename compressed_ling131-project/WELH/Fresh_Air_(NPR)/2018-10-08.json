asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now ...\nIt would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our teeth

this man was speaking from the very wrong that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons final lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and\nAdam Cohen wrote the introduction to it and they take a

Rhode Island public radio and do you mash DARPA journalism alliance\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished\nAnd it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes there was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend then quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading of homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which you talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nAppreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that have his work has a life outside of his mouth\nAnd him and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nSo I go and they want to get on their record as say oh I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm a I'm a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nWell since you've declined to read more pounds that your father I'm going to find out I'm not being ... can tank wrists are intransigent now it's just it's a\nIt's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading and not another problem with us\nFrom the interview that we recorded in the thousands sick and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was kindly according to me

selling Marion here that's no way to say goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm\nSo did you hear him he didn't he didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs and\nSingers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing at ... um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was a craft at something people actually did\nAnd the ... like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older than you then you sort of see how I remember um I remember I myself was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nWhen we were sitting on the corner will shirt and liberate\nIt's going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said he was scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSaid an amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground\n[noise] how old were you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember so how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nYou'd always he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n... like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things put at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so are you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of and\nHow is it that far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and you know as I say the ... the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate ... which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nOr there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for\nUm his reconnection to people I'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\nYeah you know\nIt is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible the [laughter]\nThe to the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics says liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they have never sold more than six thousand tickets so
