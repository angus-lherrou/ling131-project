give you options not answers data not just conclusions because we aren't just public radio [noise]\n\n\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation raise the question again how do we decide who to believe when a woman says she was sexually assaulted by someone she knows behind a closed door and the men denies it\nThat's an issue of universities have been grappling with\nMy guest finesse or group gory artists is the author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus over the course of three years she interviewed a hundred twenty students from twenty universities spoke with nearly eighty administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports\nShe says that while writing the book she witnessed a historic moment when survivors moved from the shadows to the spotlight burst on campus and then nationwide with the me too movement\nGory out as as a contributing editor at the New York times magazine in Vanity Fair and has won a national magazine award\nVanessa grigorian artist welcome to fresh air you know you write in your book that there's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses but with me too movement it spread beyond campuses\nWhat'd you the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread I guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators and the Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses\nWhat'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about what what did you take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by us the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault\nYeah if those senators had um ban on college campuses as presidents or administrators are title nine officers they would have had a completely different set of questions right because they would have already known what college campuses no about sexual assault which is\nVery few women make it up very few women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight\nSomething like not having reported for many years is not a big deal most sexual assault survivors and don't actually report for awhile and they wouldn't know that\nThey might not actually get a lot of evidence because there is very rarely good evidence and many of these cases particularly those that happens thirty six years ago so they have to look at the credibility of each percent\n[noise] last Tuesday while the FBI investigation we're still going on into Brett Kavanaugh President Trump spoke to reporters on the south lawn of the White House before boarding a flight this was October second\nAnd so this this was before the Senate voted on the Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court before they confirmed him so this is President Trump\nWhile I say that it's a very scary for young rented America what did you see a Sylvia absolve you may not be guilty of which is a very very ... very difficult times so\nCountry is not ready to receive a U.S Bush it we were to return to our ... remember what you have to so democracy\n... well ... was human rights are and they're moving demented words when the government will not be in the group of why\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with the ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nUm it is there are no commonly held understanding\nI don't\nThink that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mode and are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this and researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sexes something ... folk and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a\nPermission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when he me\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't see it that way no get away from me and pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until\nBand up giving up um\nKnow some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once you're in the room it's really hard to get a house\nOh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes you like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know kind of try to come up and danced with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and it was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I'm In one of his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happened here\nThat was definitely a first for me\nI mean I ... yeah I I didn't\nThink that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and I'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who\nTruly a\nYou know are in night clubs or at dance parties a lot understand like this is my buddy I own at people have to ask permission to touch it\n[noise] my guest is Vanessa ... author of blurred lines sex power and consent on campus we'll talk more after a break\nCan Tucker will review in early

in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have any advertising and no one knew what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside of group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did an and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was a ... can go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or jak lean Kennedy's how she pronounced it [noise] um so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of

offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazine for if there were many off at the time [noise]\nFan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean up pitiful version but we have the chef for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue\nAnd ah and ah and then it is scored to classical music where there's one note that if the gunshot and undermine crawls over the top of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was

Myers\nAnd [laughter]\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't happy ever now all drag queens or hip I mean you see him that stock and they're all really found in the sense of humor and they have funny names everything but but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest\nIn Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous a drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorist which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\nYou know early in your
