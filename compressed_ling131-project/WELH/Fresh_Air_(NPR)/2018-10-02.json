R. dot org\n\n\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross President Trump has denied Russia interfered in our election or he's a quid vacated in spite of the evidence presented by American intelligence agencies and journalists when other reporters who has broken stories that have revealed new information to the public\nThat interference and about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia is my guest Greg Miller he covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nThis year he shared a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy it's a chronological narrative connecting many of the most important stories on the subject and adding new reporting to those stories\nGreg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um\nStories of obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergei 'cause there\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time in a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was was was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nWith foreign leaders are we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the oval office\nThat start with a ... or I guess that had really direct consequences Flynn was fired so and was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story that Flynn had calls with the Russian ambassador to the surrogate Kislyak\nTelling Kislyak that the Trump Administration would lift sanctions elect don't worry about it uh the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration and these calls happened\nAfter the election but before the inauguration of right so how did how did you get onto this how did you start investigating this story\nWell I'm you know so\nThe post reported that about this secret CIA conclusion that Russia had in fact sought to help elect Donald Trump had had essentially had a candidate in the race\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCards ... actual letters in the in the mail or thanks for readers from far away places um notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and some people would stop me and thank me and\nI mean that was a that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Washington Post reporter\nBrad Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice Trump Russia and assume version of American democracy we'll be

reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice\nSee and it kind of brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration stories that have been reported by meller and other reporters that the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested that you used the word lion\nAward lying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] it's very controversial in the journalism world because lying implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not you and you're saying it anyways\nSo people are just weighing that is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se ... very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have\nRun fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there was a\nThere is an ... here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um you spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing CJD by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discussed sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone writes a ... there was digging by our news organization and many others\nAnd this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has who has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contract between Jared Kushner and and officials from Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already a banana evidence of contact that you could say that that was incidental and ...\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact and it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible that he was you know he was trying to throw sand and our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump\nAnd that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post and has written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy\nWe'll talk more after a break and TV critic David

I'm not going to cost and not in an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are your guidelines\nFor using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really an a really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U. S. government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling you the information\nAbsolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us um these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well\nWhat is the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions and government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be but\nIt's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up\nThe stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations are perfect and and then can we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news you know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right it it's really\nThe posts credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader um journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and to do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up a metal to record what ... what a transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation\nBut Trump is also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\nCombing is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting more to say he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once reporter spends a little time in jail they're making new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism or anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell let me let me ... it\nWhether it made me afraid I I was confident enough\nIn my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening it's um\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nMiller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting thank you Glenn Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and

I. P. R. dot O. archery and thanks for years for\nThis is fresh air I'm Terry Gross back chef Lydia ... which is known for her PBS cooking shows her cookbooks and her restaurants her memoir is called my American Dream\nOr what [laughter] I Love in the book you basically become the cook for your family for dinner 'cause your mother's working as a long commute and she doesn't get home early enough to prepare dinner\nSo so you're preparing dinners and then you start making like a Duncan Heinz cake from cake mix box and like you're totally fascinated with the idea of this well mix in a box [laughter]\nWell you know it it made me so successful yes my mother worked late because first we settled in New Jersey\nAnd then we moved to a story I Am but she kept her job in Jersey because she was afraid she wouldn't get another job and so she came home just in time six o'clock for dinner and she would prepare for me just like a a regular recipe you know the ... the beans whatever it was that I was cooking put it in cooking half an hour\nAnd so on all the instructions so I Would do that but then I discovered the cake mixes these wonderful kind of boxes\nThat you added one leg to the mix or maybe some butter put it in the oven and will allow this this fluffy delicious cake would come out and then you know even the icing\nThey gave you on the side how to make the icing with powder sugar or whatever so I was thrilled and I almost every night we had a cake for dessert now that was the good life for us you know we weren't used to that and it made me kind of oh an accomplished cooked\nI made a cake with every dinner and [laughter] we used to anything that sweet no no no we we didn't have that many Swedes candies or that so the whole thing was kind of a discovery you became engaged at age Eighteen\nTo for the ... you and your husband decided to open a restaurant in Queens New York uh without a tough choice for you because it's a big investment it's a big responsibility and you you never know what's going to happen when you start your own business\nAbsolutely but you know um my husband he's also as an immigrant from the same area he had come before me as a as a man a young man and was working in restaurants\nOr had worked up to being a major de lis fruit will save some money and worked very hard so we had some money and ah taking challenges a I think maybe that was the beginning of\nOf you know or to gather especially if you take it with somebody in the view of the same mind\nThen I had my my mother my father who always kind of with us and the same home to have their own apartment but live when us they encouraged to you know we'll help you or whatever so when you have the support and you see the opportunity the challenges you want to try\nAnd you're young and so we weren't really afraid although you know it took for this little restaurant nine table restaurant in in the suburbs of New York it took all of our savings ah then I\nUltimately ended up in the kitchen as a sous chef learning much more\nWas the menu and your first restaurant and Italian man you as you understood Italian food to be from having lived in Italy or within an Italian American as Americans understood [laughter] I tell ya da\n... was Italian American because you know we had worked in restaurants most of them were Italian American food uh we had\nJeff and worked with him in the kitchen and learned the Italian American cuisine and we were quite successful but but you know I must say that slowly I began adding some of the specialties that we ate at home\n[noise] so after having a restaurant in Queens you expanded that restaurant into the um store next door and then you can get another restaurant and then sold those to have a restaurant\nIn Manhattan and why did you want one in Manhattan and what does that signify tia well Manhattan\nWas the epicenter or you know of this big city with everything that was sort of\nUp and coming in in in the world of style of music and her food\nAnd ah ... my husband had worked uh most of his time in Manhattan in a elegant Italian restaurants\nAnd sort of you know he's clientele Olivia ... chips you need to come to Manhattan that's where you belong\nOr your food and of course that was the draw and also being in the big times if you will Manhattan was being in the center of everything in a sense and that's one of the press and people in the industry really began to notice at this\nItalian woman chef that hooks odd Italian food\n[noise] it's funny 'cause it sounds like some of the foods that you were cooking were foods that were cooked by like poor villagers [laughter] like your grandmother but they were being served inexpensive elegant restaurant\nYes absolutely but that's the reality you know you can place food you can\nEven manipulated and much of it is being done by chefs today but that was kind of true to form because you know the message we pack this is who I was and this is who I wanted to present you know the Libya that came from from that area\nAnd the Libya that is now in America and wants to connect her two cultures together so I cooked the reality of a you know real peasant food\nBut presented it great service so you know we had our son years they're all uh so so we brought the simple dishes to a level of service and presentation that was\nAbove what would be in the home\nWhere there are many women shaft when you became\nA chef\nThere were not that many but there were the you know George School saying Barbara dropped a Mary Sue Miller can all of those where were women that were really kind of a you know a ... working in our industry and that were good but it was you know it's a tough industry for for women is still is", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
