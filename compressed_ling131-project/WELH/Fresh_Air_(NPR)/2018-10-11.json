eleven lunar module commanded by Neil Armstrong became the first manned spacecraft to land on the moon moments later Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon and said these now famous words\n[noise]\nThat was fifty years ago when NASA didn't have the computer technology we have today\nAnd that makes a successful moon landing even more remarkable I guess ... directed the new movie first man based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and took incredible risks to test new spacecraft and fly to them or\nI'm sure has played by Ryan Gosling who also starred in the movie musical Lala land which does al wrote and directed ... one of the best director Oscar for that film he also wrote and directed whiplash\nLet's start with a scene from first man astronaut Neil Armstrong Mike Collins and Buzz Aldrin played by Cory stall are seated together at a table at a press conference in July Nineteen sixty nine taking questions from reporters before embarking on their Apollo eleven mission to the moon Neil\nIf it does turn out you'll go down in history will cut us off do you have about that when it thought it to a guy suppose that flight successful we're planning on that flight mean successful uh [noise] I I just know how you feel about being a part of history\nI think I could shed some light here responsibility but it's exciting to be first in my wife is excited to keep slipping jewelry and it might be bigger [noise]\nPlanning on taking some ... and the numbers sure\nWhat what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise] Neal when you take anything by the choices they force you\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself have been had the the same sort of initial ah you know it didn't really line up with the sort of films I've been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the ... the incredible book the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the Maddox terrain at least two\n... and ah but just on this kind of grand cosmic canvas and so it seemed like if if I could tell that story and tracing you know the sort of journey from the kind of ...\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense than\nThan the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible derailed the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh disorientation and just physical jostling of all of this\nYou know we didn't literally a spin Ryan in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and Dave Scott you know uh uh we uh\nAnd and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up to the heart and question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting ... from where we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second uh cause rice the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can ... so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to arrive that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the New Orleans I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quiet at all inside the space capsule recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space and film it is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike a spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you'd actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that\nStands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they download Nassar's preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moon disaster um and uh what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a\nUrine Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can ah again you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given but in a way to capture\nJust to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time just incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut new let's Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nMy guest is ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed at la la land and whiplash

directed the new movie first men starring Ryan Gosling has Neil Armstrong the first human to walk on the ...\n[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think it was a music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you referred yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes under the category about of of genre that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with\nAll due respect inhale Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your ... to the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye himself it stumbled on a ... book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous ... music that ah that Neal is that the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a than Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nOkay well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called Luna Rhapsody\n\n[noise]\n\nOh no\n[noise]\n\nNo no [noise]\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by ... lots of directed la la land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on ... land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about you Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut uh as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and we put dishing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real ... miniature as it's it's it's\nYou know a lot of land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequenced is this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit of the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day or this was a film but they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were gonna see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right in pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nYou mentioned that thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on ... congratulations\nAnd thank you so nice to be back thanks

Rhode Island public radio and UMass dark journalism a large [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with ... author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault but maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual object I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this as you understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan needs to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like asked means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sexes something ... folk and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely\nTo the ... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an
