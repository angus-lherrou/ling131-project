again and then being in a relationship again\nAnd what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationship\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago\nTen years after near oh okay okay I Know what\nWas the gender or race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people color few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um\n[noise] that can be\nExhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you write that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience [noise] yeah\nI mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone starts doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can a curse is I I don't have to believe it too so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\n\nUm so I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why why tour across America and we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves this whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we\nHave different energy that allowed the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell her jokes in a different way or different style and we were beating ourselves up in allowing that sort of kind of patriarchal sort of energy to affect\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or a culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like\nUm imagine what it's like to not have laughed and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a two to queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like hey young black women [laughter] but you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about\nBy black hair woes and high school with like Laura she doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has ... ... ... like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK with being\nOut numbered in a way and not letting that make me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or you know Martin Family Matters and\nGirlfriends and all these sort of shows where you could still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right\nAbout body image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight dues and for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four\nWith a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nTo overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been\nA expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place than you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that self doubt come and so I think what I have done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising but not like I don't have a skill in a house\nI make it is not about a number if you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans\nI feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ... I Know that but there there'll be like oh yeah we have a size four and it's like that is unacceptable to me\nTo only have a size four is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people\nI'm a ten twelve that's just what it is and there'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you\nSurely it's like how dare you be like oh well we couldn't find anything in your size you didn't look 'cause I dress myself every day I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need to have\nThis sort of oh well we only have a zero to four so you either ... or you're you're screwed is not how you should treat anybody I Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into and every time I didn't fit in something like I'm Sorry\nThe Apollo time I would apologize after every single offered in ...

adventure story powered by the helium a fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation\nThe new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage his younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights\nHe turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone the law\nTo pitch in lifts wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process

for the death of a white visitor to the plantation\nTeach fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime

elite and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ... ingenious storytelling gifts but her novel is more than just a boy in bobble\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from pitch elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to leader exhibits\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long scenes science as the great equalizer wash says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often

you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm\nNot a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise] to\nOf of um of one's workers a you know everywhere expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher [noise]\nThe ah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but I'm very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field work or on the plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nBut the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild who goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes live forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man church\nUm and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in this and this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrow stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty in itself to to look at somebody and and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gifts like he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man it's just completely [noise] you just naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under touch\nBought some you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a ... character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a [noise]\nA ... you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of men it's kind of weird prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his\nA philosophy or adult life but you know having said that he's somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy in his personality that's so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash a scapegoat from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives in ... you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slavery the slave economy\nYeah exactly I think that son teach for instance likes to believe that because he has these in light and ideas that he is and because he's actually\nI think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and [noise]\nAnd he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his place\nIn in in the world's but he's not really thinking about the fact that you know for all of his scientific pursuits this is\nBeing funded by slavery a and he's kind of turned a blind eye to that and so he's profoundly affected by it because he wouldn't be able to do what he does a without that a dark commerce going on\nAnd also his family relationships are all tangled 's uh because of this but by no means is suffering anywhere near the suffering of somebody like Washington who is I'm\nNot free he's bodily not free he's psychologically not free and when he becomes physically free\n\nFrom

something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting me 'cause they called me into the living room and I remember thinking oh maybe we're going to go in another family vacation\nWorld and it was fantastic [noise] and my grandfather he sat me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she's a drug addict and that's that's why she's been gone all the time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trusted one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I got older sometimes I I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share the story more widely\nThat people must have asked you kids must have asked you all the time like how can the grandparents are raising you as your parents\n[noise] they would and I would just make up stories are my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe the track my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nMiddle your mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of graphic memoir for young adults I Know I'm an adult and I really like that I I Would recommend this to adults but um what did you want to like target AT T ...\nThere's probably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they often open up the bedroom door and find sleeping right outside of air um didn't have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help you do stigmatize you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and\nThat's where for me are was such a saving grace because uh I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have that reaction you expected what did your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles\nThis is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset and what did\nYou learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics ... that that was actually\nUseful for is certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know at the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but\nNot right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise] you know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um but in regards to art style I think any sort of how to drop\nOne is just have your own style [laughter] donating you ignore everything about her [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hey kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family

Hampton I live in our ... no I didn't see the paper what happened and uh my mother was arrested for expressing false prescriptions at at pharmacies\nAnd I went in person to talk to my mother had of her court date and she she is she assured me that she was not using she was just selling it to a guy to make extra money I said well that's really not going to convince me to bring my kids around here\nAnd I really had to put some distance between us at that point you know what I had a three year old a newborn and they needed their dad and I needed to be fully there for my children\nAnd I and so yeah the the way I Would keep track of her she would she would get arrested 'em and they'd get arrested for driving without a license or or or you know she would be driving and the police officer tried to pull her over and she would try to outrun them\nShe did spend a little bit of time in jail again ah the last time I saw her was that a family funeral\nAnd that this was this would have been in spring of two thousand six team and we had a we had a nice connection you know and she said I Love you and I always will and I said mom I Love you and I always will and you know you do ... I Would worry I wake up in the middle of the night thinking\nWhat if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people just she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long and ... process from really going to need to talk to her about when I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd Arthur is her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already and on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family\nAnd on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise]\nAnd and I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home [noise]\nSo I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that you would wear the dress she wore it to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house I would open the closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was for sponsor and I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly would be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so he opened the door\nLately out of his mind he was high on heroin his eyes were blood red his skin was white as bone he had a T shirt sweat pants no no socks her shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute and I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom make my mom beautiful again that I answered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find\nCouldn't find the dress for the night my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and and all all her for drug paraphernalia\nAnd so her boyfriend at the time said oh you know there's there's the cedar closet and this other ... right yeah of course I dress that was that important to her she would preserve and the cedar closet\nSo I stepped in the other room where the cedar closet is and on a little night stand I saw him down and then on the lazy boy chair I saw three handguns and neck so that was to handguns and now I'm realizing I'm On a room filled with handguns with my back\nTo someone who is high on heroin and I said this is exactly why I didn't come to visit my mom in these last two years because this is exactly what I figured I'd step into so now I'm thinking what if I'd done\nWhat if I die here my children need me\nSo I I made the boyfriend like I just need to be alone with my mother's things could you just give me a moment so he he moved and you know as loud as I could I said well Steve and you know the\nThe dresses in here I'm just going to go to Macy's and uh by her address me and he just looked at me and he's like you sure we can keep looking at a\nConference [laughter]\nVery quickly I said okay I Need to get my baby albums I Need to get this photo album okay here's this painting I made for her ... as quickly as I could grabbing handfuls of things I wanted to hold onto in the event that the house blew up the next day\nUm wow and so now I'm I'm making preparations for my mother's memorial and we didn't publicize the memorial I didn't put in the newspaper till afterwards but now I'm really fearful this guy's going to turn up with with guns and so I hired security\nBut in the interim between that moment and and the memorial\nThat boyfriend was arrested for impersonating a police officer so he had shop lifted a number of items from a Walmart like dog for the paper towels and he brandish a a gun and said no I'm I'm with the police and it's good and and and and come to find out all of those handguns were Bebe guns made to look like real guns\nUm and that but that didn't change\nMy heart was racing in that moment [laughter] so at her memorial\nAnd and even though I mean I was expecting there to be maybe ten people there but this this funeral home was filled with cousins my friends you know uh my ... friends family friends who remember the good parts of her\n[noise] All right let's take a short break here and then we'll attack somewhere if
