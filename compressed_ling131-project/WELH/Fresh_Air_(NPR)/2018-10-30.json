life synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturday we decided to postpone are scheduled interview with Jonah Hill we'll hear that tomorrow today we're going to talk about how our views echo the rhetoric of the white nationalist movement\nAnd about the threat that this movement poses and I guess ... it was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred and focus is on the story of Derek Black\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and created the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an Arab parents in the movement but here we now says racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties in a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with Sasha ... this morning\n... welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nGarrett black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father John Black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find ... black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Bowers\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooter spotty yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight to white nationalist slogans\nFourteen refers to a a fourteen word for statement of purpose that is central to what strong frog does about um it was securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children at and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch and why people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was that the synagogue that's exactly the the language and the motivation that exist on store front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race war that they believe is under way\nYeah it was a I'm a ... hours had had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDo and both Don and Derek were central to the the sort of creation of that language even the term genocide that was one of the main things that Derrick and Don tried to spread and popularized on the radio show and and the idea behind it was that instead of speaking about ah you know\nMinorities and slurs or things like that that they could appeal for white people by the idea that their race was slowly disappearing and more than that that this was a genocide that somebody else is doing to white people uh you know it's it's\nA ludicrous idea but unfortunately it's had huge purchasing this movement now white genocide I Would say it\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting and synagogue\nI'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on storm front now there\nIs some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened ah there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that's\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global health and ah choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway\nThen you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction so\nBlack since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um and I think that he's heartbroken and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels small ways ... and do you wonder how much the re messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism\nPleasing to incidents like this there was central to creating the phrase white genocide and so it's a popular movement then somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio for years and your your wife is a I think it's it's ...\nUSS low is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\nWhat have you always wondered about Rhode Island or south eastern methods you may be what happened to the race to the top grant money or who is really behind that piece of legislation why do some streets change names every few blocks to build that amphitheater in when socket and ask\nYour question big or small for our new feature the bubble or when you ask the questions and then our reporters looked for the answers ask away and the public's radio dot org slash the butler\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Jared black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we noun sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included ... the first question was addressed to dark black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to it's like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like the popular everywhere and white nationalism in so that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable or whether they really believed that there was a difference between the\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race and their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confident way\nIs I'm sure that everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insults where they live their clients to word um\nRatio is racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing an end cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes no language that I think is still\nEffective and useful for us as we talk about it we're\nListening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett lack a former young

nationalist movement\nThe interviewer listening to us with Derrick black who was a young leader of the movement before we known thing has used when he was twenty to his father Don black is a former KKK grand wizard and founded the largest white supremacist website storm front\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nA really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic uh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how to are we going to define who is white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and ...\nOf the time and there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually wide by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post's reporting ... the author of a book about Barrett black and white nationalism called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break this is fresh air\nWhat have you

friday\nThis is fresh air let's get back to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former white nationalist leader who announced his views when he was twenty to his father Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter Eli sass low the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred so\nDerrick one of the things you did you have been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any belief outside of your family's racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida there were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's their black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were you know very upset when I found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew Shabaab dinners took the strategy\nUh not talking to me about it or I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something that we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about what we're thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general at being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermine the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where either this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast staring out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one has just built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and\nUh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew in most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people and to the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in and of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that's not happening quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick headset Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWould sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and ... yeah\nJews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you know in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs\nJews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and\nAre are are sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist would define as the white race and so ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews there was all but wiped out by the Holocaust that in ... and and that was the\nDefinitive experience of his\nYoung life was growing up in an orthodox community that was largely defined by a Bye bye\nAnd and the Holocaust and Moshe ... had had gone and traveled to these concentration camps and had had learned German to connect with his father's history and Derek and also learned German because of his very divergent family history\nAnd the fact of the two of them a week after week we're sitting at the same table sometimes having conversations and the Germans they learned because of\nBecause of these incredibly diversion family histories and began to have an effect\nThere's a lot of Holocaust denying within the white nationalist movement can you explain to me how it's possible to believe in the first place that the Holocaust didn't happen\nIt it is because you go to history conferences with people who do have history credentials who've taught at universities who've written books that are published and who are\nA respected in some kind of circle where we're at some point in their life and then you all sit around and they say here let me show you Fifteen reasons why the Holocaust didn't happen and then people just sort of buy into it\n[noise] um after Charlottesville a\nThe public's radio dot

being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation\nIt's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he's starting\nAfter the break this is fresh air\n[noise]\nServing in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts ... public radio eighty nine points three of them [noise]\nReporting on south coast communities ... of the public radio and ... journalism alliance [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money\nBall and the wolf of Wall Street\nI Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting whenever\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would\nYou be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the characters in The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\n[laughter] who is who\nMarge was Don Corleone because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer and no\nSiblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nAs Diane Keaton like why are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but uh Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who have\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things I I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this film and most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are\nYou cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kid was a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids it's so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burned in the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the aid subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbing and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the rape and ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this done it for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and\nI think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm On\nSays that when I really dissect it is well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine Corps again will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen sixty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil

word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John she ... she told me\nAnd then in Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir and money ball\nAnd then in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry Levinson or people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan bill Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny A's off played by you who eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene\nThat's going on here [noise]\n[noise] I mean it\nBuilt for them to actually see that call around\nI think we live in a building\nSwell fools\nWas it [laughter] what do you do [noise]\nUnemployment went on for work what is your\nStock [noise] germs Russia was if you saw right [noise] there's a lot of money [noise]\nYou know do a wreck for myself I'm trying to put it together from Mexico was it in the same building I'm just I'm not\nUnderstand how much money [noise]\nOn Seventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm Serious and unfair to to say how much money [noise]\nFor told you so many thousand so technically suddenly two thousand [noise]\nYou show me a place for Seventy two thousand dollars I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\nNo you're not really fun it was like quit and he quit his job was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets ... well the things about 'em to like phosphorus and white T if I got to deal with your wife ... one rooms with clear lenses just look more wash\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and\nMy guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\n[noise] I just I see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge or characters to just show their behavior as people\nAnd the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity in there\nAnd I like\nHow unabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse which is something you've tried to do and you're in a movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm going to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties if we don't want to be back to The Simpsons I mean our kind of\nYou as a terrible father right well I read it terrible father [laughter] you can't be viewed but he also incidentally loving big hearted\nPerson right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area\nOkay so this weekend this Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with step mother\nHad a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by Vanessa Bayer and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate she was named nprmontagne over now my nightmares will take place in Syria and Terry Gross\nAll that may be good if not want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay\nThe name check on that show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to here at this moment\nI was just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that you have to listen to NPR incredibly boring to a kid even though he so aware to talk about the show with such\nDetail and understanding but that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first time this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Eddie Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick the kid lean back in ... one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if you will like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that has a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times\nWell known
