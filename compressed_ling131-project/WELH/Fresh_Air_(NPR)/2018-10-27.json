fresh air and Terry Gross my guest Anthony to Curtis is the author of a biography of Lou Reed which just came out in paperback\nCurtis is a contributing editor for Rolling Stone where he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research your Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives Lou Reed cofounded the velvet underground which you played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen on many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote songs that had a spiritual quality to Kurdish as other than Bob Dylan the Beatles and James Brown no one has exerted as great an influence on popular music as Reid has\nRead died of liver disease five years ago at the age of Seventy one the Curtis says he wouldn't have written this book while Reid was alive quote this book does not at all times see Lou the way he wanted to see himself\nAspects of their sex life his drug use and is cruelty that he came to be embarrassed about or discuss here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the sun heroin from the velvet underground first album\nMm Mm\nMm\nMm\nMm\nMm [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThat's Lou Reed and Anthony the Kurdish welcome to fresh air and congratulations on your new biography of Louis read\nUm are you so much for pleasure bigger so let's start with that song which thumbs up so much about\nWhat may made Lou Reed different from other music uh being made a at that time um give us your take on heroin and how it fits into not only reach career but into the larger music of that time [noise]\nI'm such a daring statement you know certainly was recorded in Nineteen\nEden of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we are going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWere mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I well yeah\nThat's true and that and there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much of the moment interestingly because I've got a con around the block\nSee anything he was on like flu it in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's ah describes him as inter and [laughter] it's kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality was something I think you know as you gaze habits you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of open to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had to language for it then\nThat's right they didn't that language didn't exist if I did one guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this\nLose never forgiving them for that but when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI have a price on Iran I ... yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was starting about Lou being cheap introducing a guy who wants to spend money we were living in these all these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said what would your father ever given their money and she said of course he would have given him money you know if it's anything for the you know he was the you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me a reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own he didn't have any money not eat set so he got a job working for his father typing\nIn his father's accounting office yes extending transgression of is that [laughter] I'm not totally\nThey don't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time in making money and if they were they had over ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they have that kind of relationship that was a [noise]\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize that song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you know we got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they ... didn't work for lead [noise]\nThat's yeah that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... a a Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular and you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a banjo rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know ... you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground what kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be singer to you know to be there leads\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with him he's limited Nico was participation as much as he could\nYou know um she only sign of you know a few songs or the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got the you know we get Nicole on the band as well after having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] except with every you know part of those times\nUm and that was a year so that was one of the issues with Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time were who was in the newspapers all the time they're not\nYou know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like all this crazy guy you know what he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou trick advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in a\nRock and roll certainly back that was pretty Ernest thing and we are we're host seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a bad and you know for for people who haven't heard them yet you don't hurt our amazing mirror so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way out of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony ...

[noise]\n... from out of the island\nActually read walk on the outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm\nSo that so that was actually a head friendly but it's not architects from your book like he was a cat he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible they're good to be a rock band to have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know somewhat more ... to go to Adam ... yeah yeah precisely and even if you did have heads you know you got a\nYear or two and then you went home but um you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nA but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you\nKnow the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected I'm and I'm a ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record\n'em [noise] so you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed it stand you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just\nYou know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that was unsinkable before Lou did it\nAnd I'm just I'm going to look I never wanted he wanted to have his music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter] honestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it\nMhm mhm [noise] um so um\nThat album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well\nOne thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly in the song street hospital apart call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview you know at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially you know saying like rituals go stole whatever jewelry was around and took off\nAnd [noise] um I think\nThey had been falling apart there's some lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel wanting to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife and you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise]\nYou know over the course of two or three years Lu got clean a got straight\nAnd um [noise] and his gay life became something that\nI mean he still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was as out there as anybody could be he also turned on it\nAnd are often not with that you know that much um [noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it [noise]\nYou know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure but the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great raining [noise]\nUm so ... there's the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle trying to say anything about that that's part\n[noise] yeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nUh industry or as an thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they dragged him out onto the street and just left them by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his guests to get just girls body out of his apartment [noise]\nLet's hear it it's just ... [noise]\n\nYou don't live near leaving and then it really was a nice dog in and I really miss that ...\nWould you know getting the has the Chinese intensively so that was ... and it's not like we were there was this one new and it was the main you know I when I first\nWoman's noon and then within a year or two pages\nAnd [noise]\nWhen you want to be moved around the girl\nIs even worse than it is I don't have to get a loan and I knew this ain't no injury to his mind your brand new Orleans being just lay around the yard is gene by morning on the run\nYou know people who enjoys getting in line in a\nThat they can even colder\nLosers thing that the that\nLevel than the right to be one moment you know it's cool man\nThat's Lou Reed from St hassle and my guess Anthony Curtis has written a new biography of Lou Reed was going to take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air\nGreat journalism comes from asking questions about the world around us\nAnd going out in search of answers so the public radio is launching a new people Howard initiative called the bubble or what have you always wondered about Rhode Island or southeastern Massachusetts that the public radio can investigate for you you can ask us anything big or small", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "27"}
