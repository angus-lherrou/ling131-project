... and sons\nHe asked to read a poem that he just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nOr used to be your favorite drunk good for one more laugh\nThen we're both right out of luck and look was always\nYou put

something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes there was this really dark quality but\nThere was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that have his work has a life outside of his mouth and ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading\nHis poems so I've always wanted to I Want to get on their record as saying you know and I'll\nGo one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song I supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time not with my metered with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that your father I'm going to say I'm not being ... can tankers are in transit you\nKnow it's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a

into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older [noise] there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nThen you grow older and then you then you sort of see how I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know maybe maybe I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stop continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and he's scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSaid an amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and do something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground [noise]\nHow long were you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people who had been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father\nWas able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from them at all but just to follow her own whims\nAnd my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nYou'd always you always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\n[noise] oh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived uh\nAnd it was a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put at the at the tea where the road and met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of and\nHow long as you're not that far\nWell he did that and variations of that through my own entire life and and as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate this week which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nOr there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for um his reconnection to people I'm ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing his soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression\nUm and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\nYeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um been incredible that [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work with his devotion to blanketing pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and\nUm but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose

W singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media [noise]\nYou look at the Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign they were hip to the importance of this\nWhat do they do so it was actually a the twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered\nThan a mouse would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the ... of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nTwo things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nWhose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out but importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefields\nThe uh targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nEssentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you pull put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means and the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cars and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist and Taylor Swiss army of swift east you can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same\nBut the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you know giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one pulls from the world at at crowd sources so to speak and one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and ... and try and layer\nOnto it so for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion to drive it through your own ends the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh as Dave Davies included with Peter Singer and Emerson Britain authors of a new book like war the weaponization of social

speaking with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations also with us ... W singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\n[noise] you know I'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of\nHim they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and\nUh it was in a certain way you had both sides using the exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military we're using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where uh they were enlisting the online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd sourced hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh too I unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you had the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... or narrative that a doctor Ford or the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of burying the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this in the cabinet debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath as you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view\nBut history itself or at least the online place that we go to a stop Bush and learn about history we ... so for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine Russian um actors go under what competed very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nI mean where I he used a term I'm In is a high school yearbook was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term it's about drinking game the problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on week at the DEA to make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms\nAre private companies are and they're now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections in the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle task of of figuring out what is acceptable and what is not um\nAnd that there is a developing tool called neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just mimic but maybe in some way surpass I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nWonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with the machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same ... ... for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on a war a certain way\nTo challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes\nThese are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not\nThe companies in turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks\nAnd so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome the origin of social networks are online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks like that could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden honoring some you know profane of comets\nAnd creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo ah George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich oh by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take out and build it together to allow you to in essence create a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's gonna be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
