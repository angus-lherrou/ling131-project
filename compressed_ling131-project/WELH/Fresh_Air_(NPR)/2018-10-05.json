founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a recent issue of the magazine he says ... relentless drive to expand Facebook's reach\nWhich means the number of people who've logged in six of the last seven days and whatever you could do to try to raise that el six or seven that was the priority [noise]\nUm but as you know somebody put it to me\nThe problem with that is that eventually you exhaust the positive ways of boosting that engagement and eventually you start to look at what this person described as the dark patterns\nThe ways that you can use anxiety or vanity or to try to get people to sign on one of the things they discovered for instance was if you send somebody an email that says\nThat a Facebook friend has uploaded a picture of them to Facebook that people are almost incapable of resisting the temptation to look um and that sort of tweak that just minor behavioral nudge turned out to be um really hugely important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA central belief early on in his career and I think it's become just key to understanding why he's made choices that he hasn't in some of the mistakes that he has which is that he\nDecided early on that he was very often going to be criticized he said look this is just a fact of what we do as he said look we're not selling dog food here we are doing something in had intensely inherently controversial it's at the intersection of psychology and technology and\nSo when people criticize Facebook for being [noise] um too casual about their privacy for allowing data or to be a uh to to get out into the world\nI'm very often what she came to believe was that they would criticize them at the time but over time eventually they would accept that they would get used to it and they would keep signing on they would keep growing\nAnd that idea about criticism I'm\nReally hardened and became a central governing principle at Facebook the sense that they were\nLeaders they were pioneers they were forging ahead they had to push the public beyond its comfort zone when it came to being\nLess private because if they didn't do it then people wouldn't wouldn't go there but they were convinced that even in the cases of controversy when you had\nA civil libertarians or regulators or politicians ordinary member of the public complaining about Facebook that that was simply a sign that they were being bold and that idea continued really until until the present day\nYeah is it true that in two thousand ten he said privacy is no longer a social norm\nHe did and it caused a big uproar at the time or he said look this is a generational difference we don't feel\nThe same way about privacy that our parents and grandparents did\nEr and people ... that's ... that's wild that's not right to privacy is built into the very nature of the United states and it's really imbedded in the bill of rights and um his belief was that it was as ... as it was often described an antique and that we needed to push people\nFurther there was in in the early days of Facebook there was a\nA ... a a phrase that was bandied about called radical transparency the idea that you had to be\nAggressively transparent in order 'em to be modern this the sense was as one person to put it um you know that in the future because of Facebook and other things like it that were exploding the boundaries of privacy that extramarital affairs would become impossible people couldn't hide things like that they could no longer hide\nTheir lives outside of work from their lives and work and they believe that to be a virtue the sense that there would be this fusion the union of our private solves in our public solves\nBut that put them at odds with the public and and the key fact I think was that over and over again Mark Zuckerberg believed that being at odds with the public was not assigned you were doing something wrong it was a sign that you were doing something innovative and their\nTheir ... their model of course became move fast and break things and that motto really captured the way that they see the world now\nAlmost like redefining what it is to him [laughter]\nYeah they believe that this that this tool Facebook had that kind of power and and and they came to being at a time in Silicon Valley where were you had this almost messianic\nSense of ambition this belief that that you weren't just building computer applications you were actually building tools that were fundamentally reshaping society and they embrace that wholeheartedly\n[noise] there was a recent data breach or Facebook where fifty million users information was taken by somebody how how serious a problem as this\nThis is a serious one this is the largest security breach in Facebook's history and what was unusual about this and what sets it apart from other\nSeth this was a case of hackers were hacker we still don't know who it was I'm\nFinding essentially an an under protected door and walking through it and taking control of\nAt least fifty million Facebook user accounts Facebook also\nI'm to be safe or took another forty million users in and kick them off the force them to log back in so it may be as many as Ninety million or more that were affected by this and and in this case the hackers were able to get total control\nOf the accounts so ah there they were able to get control of your privacy settings that could go into your messages they could postings on your behalf they at this point Facebook says they haven't found any evidence of these hackers\nDoing that so that only heightens the mystery they don't know why they did it they don't know if this was a foreign government or if this were individuals if this was a criminal act\nUm but what's interesting about this particular case and why really leaps out to people who studied history ... what is it a few years ago Facebook might not have gone public with this as fast as they did they what if they would've\nProbably investigated it more internally but under the new rules that have been been imposed by the European Union um they were required to announce this very fast and as a result they had to talk about this breach or really before they know very much about it so it's it's raises many questions as its answered at this point\nShot and killed on the next radiolab how many people do we say killed by the police each year our

Yorker piece about Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook ghost in the machine is in a recent issue of the magazine\nSo when word began to emerge about the spread of a false information on Facebook or some of it by ... by Russian actors we now know about the Internet Research Agency in Russia um how did sucker bird respond to this [noise]\nInitially he rejected it he he said it just seems as he put it pretty crazy that the presence of fake news might've affected the outcome of the two thousand sixteen election he said that just a few days after the results were and\nSince then um\nInitially Facebook was really reluctant to embrace this idea that they played a meaningful role in the election but Mark Warner the senator from Virginia who's the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee contacted Facebook shortly after the election and said he really wanted to talk about the role of of Russian interference\nOn Facebook and as he put it to me they were completely dismissive they they just didn't believe that they had a serious role to play here I'm over time they have come to understand that that simply not the case they initially they estimated that about a fewer than ten million Facebook users might have been\nA might have been affected by Russian disinformation and and they later had to revise that in preparation for testimony in Congress and they said actually as many as a maybe a hundred and fifty million\nFacebook users um were affected by Russian disinformation and what's remarkable about that is is how efficient it was actually as a as a conduit for information because the Russian Internet research agency which was reporting to the Kremlin\nHad fewer than a hundred members of its staff on this project and yet they were able to reach a size a hundred and fifty million Facebook users that is extraordinary and it was a I I think to this day Facebook is struggling with that\nFundamental paradox which is that on the one hand their business and their success depends on their ability to tout their powers of persuasion they they are telling advertisers we can encourage users to listen to you to believe in you and to act on what you're telling them and yet at the same time they're trying to say that they have not\nHad this dispositive effect on our politics and that is a contradiction\nRight um and then there was the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which you know it emerged from working for the Trump campaign had acquired the personal data of what eighty seven million Facebook users that's why I'm so companies in big trouble ... Berg\nWent before Congress carefully prep of course how did he do well there was a lot right\nLike a trial here here he was on behalf of the company going in front of Congress and and it was growing calls for regulation and\nHe\nIn some ways is vastly exceeded expectations and that was because largely because Congress showed itself to be\nReally extraordinarily unprepared to deal with the complexity of face but they just simply didn't ask the kinds of questions that would have really gotten to the heart of Facebook's operations and how it makes choices\nSo much so that at one point or unhappy senator from Utah said to Mark Zuckerberg ... if you don't charge customers then how do you make any money and\n... kind of 'em gave a little smile and said senator we run ads that it was such an obvious fact anybody's paid attention to technology that it really I think under scored the mismatch between the scale and investment and sophistication of these companies\nAnd Congress's inability to come up with the laws and the rules that can respond to them in real time\nMaybe you could just explain that a bit I mean Facebook makes a fortune by digital ads how does it work you know\nIn some ways Facebook is actually a little bit like a newspaper in the sense that the way that it pays for itself is by running ads alongside the content that people post in and look for on there so [noise]\nOn any given moment when you go on Facebook you will find these highly targeted ads these are things that are chosen just for you based on your browsing behavior around the Internet based on the post that you clicked on the things that you look for\nUm they choose ads that you are much more likely to click on then you would if they were just sending the same out to everybody else and that formula that ability to micro target as it's known\nA adds to specific users has been this extraordinary geyser of business success they they just stumbled on something that was\nI'm able to generate returns for companies that kept them coming back over and over again an advertising on Facebook\nAnd the company is taking steps certainly says it's taking steps to monitor the the content I'm that political players are using the platform for and that you know\nIs arguably critical as we approach the midterms it's also pretty tricky right I mean how do you distinguish spin from Faye career you know dangerous content from distasteful how's the company I'm doing this [noise]\nBecome this consuming effort or you know Facebook over the last year as a as a controversy has grown they've undertaken one initiative after another so when it comes to political election\nUh advertising for instance what they said was okay even though for years we argued that we shouldn't have to disclose the funding sources for political ads now we are going to not only do that but we're going to go farther than TV does we're going to let users be able to click on an ad and then no not only paid for it but what other ads to those people\nPay for and and who were they targeting\nUm they're also saying we're going to\nDo more to defend against the kind of disinformation campaigns what they call coordinated inauthentic behavior essentially\nUm misinformation it's distributed to try to shape elections not only the United states but in other countries and they've had to in in many ways Dave it's almost like they've put gun to take on some of the qualities of a government you know they've had to hire people who actually worked in the U.S government on things like misinformation\nUm in order to try to ferret out efforts by Russian officials who are are in one case there was an Iranian campaign to try to spread misinformation but what we don't know and really won't know until after the midterm elections in the U.S and and the elections that come to follow our whether or not that's that's working\nFacebook on has become much more public these days in terms of talking about when it finds examples of disinformation will announce it will say we took down a group of Russian I'm In pastors who were seeking to affect American voting behavior for instance um\nBut that's either a sign that they're winning the battle or it's a sign that the battle has grown so much that they're going to continue to face this and and what I'm struck by is how much\nThe integrity and the credibility of elections now rests on the shoulders of individual employees inside a private company in California that's a very unusual situation for our democracy to be in\nBecause they can actually make distinctions about what what the public season would have doesn't\nYes yeah I mean they have to make very subtle choices ... take for example the misinformation what is the definition of misinformation when it's somebody being wrong by accident and when it's somebody being wrong on purpose when are they trying to deceive large numbers of public\nThose kinds of very subtle things which are usually the province of the Supreme Court or of lawmakers are now being handled in conference rooms at Facebook and it's very complicated\n[noise] Evan us most is a staff writer for the New Yorker

films before so it was very comfortable he knew exactly how to move in the studio or wherever I was with me and because it was such a difficult time it turned into supportive thing in a way it was\nAt

I didn't imagine it would be a terror and I couldn't do certain dances that season I did some I didn't do the ones I was really well known for and wanted to do\nAnd I waited a few months um didn't stretch it still danced but just at a certain level and then within\nThree months I could include physician\nAnd fifth position if you don't know ballet is the base of ballet it's the most\nBasic position that everything moved from and I literally couldn't do that\nSo that was a big shock and I tried everything I tried acupuncture I tried I was going to therapy I tried massage I tried I everything you can imagine I had injections um MRI's um and then the emmer I came back and said there was inflammation in my head\nSo I had my hip drained and the doctor also did an ultrasound and he said oh I see a complex labor will tear tear what do you mean a chair\nHow could I get a ...
