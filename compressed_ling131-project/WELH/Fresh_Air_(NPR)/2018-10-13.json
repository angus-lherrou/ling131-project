showing of the movie\nThat's Vincent Price in a scene from the Tingler directed by William Castle castles low budget shocking height made him a hero to today's guest screenwriter and director John Waters\nWaters started his own filmmaking career setting new lows in bad taste most notably with the cult classic pink flamingos his film hairspray which was adapted into a hit Broadway musical was an affectionate and funny much to the teen dance shows he used to watch in Baltimore\nLast Sunday the Baltimore museum of art opened a major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and is the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him John Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air in two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition in New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place he told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nTaking place were first dirty book I ever read I Love grace mentality or was it I've never read the book the Wii of Betty's crotch uh-huh [laughter] I don't know about dirty\nBut uh in Nineteen fifty six that was pretty dirty and oh it's a great you ought to repay plays a very Sammy sequels to it it opens up Indian summer he's like a woman for a [laughter]\nBut grey metallic has that famous author shot of her on the lumberjack a dirty ponytail fitness a typewriter and I was obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book but Peyton place itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut whenever they got to a sexual thing they would cut short cut away shot of symbolism like like if someone was frigid they'd have a frozen lake\nOr if somebody was getting turned on made show up blossom and brain so it was all Corning nature shops and it looks like bad National Geographic shots but actually it's dirty shots\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interested in things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction figured well I might as well planned up to the hilt and envy you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have any advertising no one knew who was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outside a group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was a ... to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo\nThey are Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounces it um so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did a newer version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there it's the same or divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone 'cause we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously and he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines where there were many off at the time\nThan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean up pitiful version but we have the show for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine is waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lives in Maryland I'm Mark ... [laughter]\nAnd uh and uh and then it is score to classical music where there's one note that is the gun shot and then divine crawls over the talk of the car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed\nSo primitive way that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose\nThat when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the real the brutal film the one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a Carney well I Believe in the art world that the frame is the hype frame as the advertising campaign so to me it was too big for one\nWall to go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine when this film that you're referring to play Jackie Kennedy devine was a you know a very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens a lot ... I wanted to be best Myers\nAnd and [laughter]\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't hep ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see 'em at Woodstock and they're all really funny and have a sense of humor and they have funny names and everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest in Philadelphia I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and a very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorists which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that your work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] somebody said something that was the ...\nThing I've ever said I didn't mean to ... to leave that most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business and every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fab there in a famous America [laughter]\nUm well I I I certainly can't complain about it I hate to hear people that are in ... perfect complained about\nAny of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick up field to go in for if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that\nThat we base a life on having to get approval strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there are lots of skills of movies and I'm not to stills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou also have failed or jail yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... the clown from howdy Doody not not no no it's the most but okay next Clara Bell\nYes he was psychotic what kind of was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery NBC Studios Clara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke who honked horns and shot you in the face with seltzer water 'em and you know captain kangaroo unclear about were the same person imagined that life\nI I think ... was um a frightening and the best sense of the word it was the first psychotic person I remember from my childhood his character\n... played clarinet yes if I knew that I felt was a couple of\n... if he was he was the first clerical\nHuh so is that your first brush 'em with with with real show business being in the peanut gallery of that duty show\nAnd I felt was fake it was all lie in Robert ... disillusioned child I was in on the secret I wanted to stay in on it\nSo you did public shows as a kid\nYeah for a long time what kind of care hand puppets and I did Cinderella and then later punch and Judy but at the end I Would come out from behind the stage which is like breaking a third world puppetry and fate of the kids you know stick out your hand of dragging puppet will bite it for good luck\nThree fourths of the kids cheered and they loved him and go crazy the other ... the rest of 'em have nervous breakdowns and started sobbing and this is basically what I still do\nJohn Waters speaking to Terry Gross in two thousand four\nAfter a break we'll listen to another conversation with waters about his book role models and I'll review the Romanoff the first TV series from Matt Weiner since he created Mad Men I'm David being ... and this has fresh air here's music featured in the John Waters film polyester performed by the re Brian combo\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air\nAnd its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise] support for NPR comes from this station and from the main office of tourism offering travelers an opportunity to explore and discover their very own main thing\nTo be inspired the original can be yourself\nAt visit main dot com\nAnd from cancer treatment centers of America\nWorking to outsmart cancer\nThrough the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment options learn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com\nFresh air continues in a moment than a town it's news from the b._b._c.

Howard Cooper thank you [laughter] and he's a he's a designer yeah she's a designer who who was not known to me um\nShe's pretty famous should come to ... ... one of the first Japanese fashioned liberal for deconstructed fashion um she's been around quite some time hugely successful in Japan\nOkay you you you described your luck as disaster at the dry cleaners\n[laughter] yeah I like her clothes she always has something the matter with it something of that so I I Love the idea when you spend more money than your shirt on an outfit for fashion no one thinks she spent money they think you got it for a nickel somewhere shops\nBut actually since it's on purpose it's like getting dressed in reverse its sneaky fashion it's wearing outfits that you liked that regular people just think it's something the matter with it and you got a bad code on\nI mean I'm I see people on the street that are homeless and actually look like al subsidized\nFederal money for [laughter] and um I find that ... I I find it to life and my father used to that you bought that something that they saw you come in boy but they did send me come [laughter] I was eager to get it\nOkay this is far too personal him [laughter] so I'll Try it anyway [noise] um do you like costuming when it comes to actual that\nNo you mean to someone have to be in a certain outfit no I'm not specific thank God\nBut what somebody has on I always really think that if boys turn their belt halfway to the right one for the ... is in on the side Marlon Brando did that's ... ... it's a lot of confidence I like\nI like somebody that pulls often effort less look but no I I don't have to have somebody dresses an airline pilot for a car and I know that I Would start laughing\nIs there something that's inherently absurd it's\nEveryone's sacrificing funny acts up your own uh-huh [laughter] really at every person says and years and never in\nWhat way as well because\nThe lengths that people go to the extremes and the conditions and the mental exercises and guilt and shame and happiness that everybody goes from what they'll do for sex is is is never ending in mind boggling and very interesting to me and um and I don't think a lot of times people choose any of it I I\nI'm a friend of mine I I think I have it in this book we're um her mother had Alzheimer's and she for years so she knows a lot about Alzheimer's the community and I asked them to people forget if they're gay or straight as the workers had never once they don't know who their family is in a wreck anybody but no one suddenly doesn't remember for gay or straight\nWell doesn't that prove really but you're born that\nOkay so I Want to call it something you say in the book you talk a little bit about being in therapy and you say a psychiatrist once told me early and treatment stop trying to make me like you\nWas yet somehow every day of my life is still a campaign for popularity or better yet a crowded funeral\n[laughter] isn't everybody in show business I'll do the same thing that they're insecure people that have to go into a field there were strangers have to tell them they're good for the rest of their life\nI figured that out a long time ago um yes I thought it was a great singer maturing sort of I'm not there to make friends you're supposed to talk of other things are making the most are comfortable but I'm paying for this let's get my money's worth so I used to after that going to think of the things that maybe the most upside to talk about which is what you're supposed to do with a psychiatrist [noise]\nUm I Believe in talking or you know Freud said the best thing ever a red line that's I think for Britain is turning hysterical misery to comment on happiness what a great great long\nBut I find that such a paradox and what you spelled out there that you're the person who has like defied every convention in your life and in your art the person who you say even even you're a minority group you're an outsider of\n'em and I mean you turn that into an art and and a career and yet you tried to get your psychiatrist to love you and you say that every day in your life is a campaign for popularity isn't that a parrot on\nNo I think it's probably being a healthy neurotic everything that I'm running out of your own economical enough but only a neurotic\nCares if everyone likes them you know and and in show business certainly it is a it is or politics focusing thing you have to get people to like you\nI'm and by writing books by making movies and everything I think you're continuing to do that at a crowded a funeral is a nice thing I liked her but the older you get the less chance of happening not another reason to make younger friends [laughter]\nSo they can fill in like it'd be Oscars when somebody goes to ... to have somebody to sit in the seat I Want that but [laughter]\nYou know because as as you've said you've\nMade a living selling shock a real surprise surprise yeah and and some of your ... to some of your early ... have some very like\nVile we you know repulsive thinking people in the ... [laughter]\nI don't agree but OK okay there were there were certainly using anarchy\nTo get their point across and they were rebelling against I'm very particular worlds or retirement lusting after things that are maybe you shouldn't but um I think the morals and all my films were were quite obvious from a good guy won and every one of the movies\n[noise] never left I think people are really surprised by how it just kind of like\nNice and funny and easy to talk to you are like earlier in your career before ... before the ... there was as public of John Waters as there is now I think people thought that you would be this really peculiar person who might I'm really traffic and sales and\nAnd the old days and days and that yeah how marijuana on my car over and over quite a while\nYou know I don't want to have a yeah I think in the beginning but I think through writing books maybe more and more my public speaking and stuff is that they realize that I'm not the characters I think that no director is usually not that many Stephen King go out there and Valerie why did they think I Would [noise]\nWell I I Want to thank you so much for talking with us and it was really great to talk with you thank you very much sir\nJohn Waters speaking to Terry Gross ... in the Baltimore museum of art has just opened a major retrospective of his visual art and published a hefty companion volume both are called John Waters indecent exposure and the exhibition runs through January six\nComing up I review the Romanoff the new TV series from Matt Weiner the creator of Mad Men this is fresh air and you'll notice something on the air\nIs recognizing in your ownership and our responsibility to you in our name the public's radio ... will continue to strive to offer olive Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts the highest quality public service journalism funded by you guided by you and accountable\nTo you [noise] journalism you can trust the public's radio at eighty nine point three of them and the public's radio dot org ...\nThis is fresh air I'm TV critic David being Cooley\nMatt Weiner the creator of the period drama series Mad Men has been produced a follow up project for TV since that claim drama series left the AMC network in twenty Fifteen\nUntil now today on the Amazon Prime video streaming service Weiner unveiled his newest effort and eight episode anthology drama series called the Roman else\nThe rollout plan for the Romanoff is unusual for Amazon just as the drama series itself is an unusual experiment for the show's creator Matt Weiner\nInstead of making the entire season of the Romanoff available at once as it does with so many of its exclusive TV series Amazon Prime video presents only the first two episodes today as the series premieres subsequent installments will be doled out weekly as they are on broadcast TV", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
