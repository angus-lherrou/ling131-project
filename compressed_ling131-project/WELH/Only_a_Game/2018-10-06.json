the twenty Eighteen best American sports writing\nIn bookstores this week welcome back and congratulations Tyler thank you and buy one of my very favorite investigative journalist you do not want her on your trail the terrific Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high you are a versus with Jessica what do we need to know\nSo Christie honoring although the soccer superstar from Portugal who played for event us in Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he has now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward in a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten when all those settled with her out according pair three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the report it assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid the settlement on multiple legal grounds there is a police investigation because she filed a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she says he raped her Fernando ...\n... says there was an internal document between her and all this lawyers and would turn although admits she said no there may not be a bigger athlete on the planet you all see this getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given that the week that we've had and also not just the week but the year you're looking at Ohio State and just of course the work you've done and Baylor and cabinet I mean you wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level high that we used to be paid closer attention\nI'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this is going to get the sort of traction but it made them it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am tired what do you think\nI I just we don't have the optimism mostly because uh we live in a system here where the powerful or is always have lifted where the powerless or not\nThis woman has every piece of evidence possible you have sponsors who are kind of backing away from all the way you have teams who are suspending him and giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected and so she her pain\nYeah and you've got Nike that's got a billion dollar endorsement deal with him by the way that's one billion for one player and of course a ... a sports has also said that they're monitoring the situation very closely Jessica this is the area that you traffic in\nWhen you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like a giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult\nBut you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence in particular it wasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so in the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate era greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world level safety at this point and was one of the main people who Neal next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of massage knee and also sexism and also racism and also everything that in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David temper\nHas said that he sides with the protests that being said it doesn't feel as if the parents have done anything monumental by hiring a dissenter hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL\nThey've done nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for us and\nYeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is is that what we do here just to get my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nIn met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\n... does a good question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player [noise] I'm\nGoing back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought this up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richardson thought there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage and races on and that's where that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that read it back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job got one and also having skepticism that it took this long for it to happen to the entire NFC South needed\nSo they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October for this\nEvery was not on a preseason roster every was on the training camp roster took notable mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should have a job or\nThat's when this starts to feel duplicitous but we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I always want to point out that at his press or with a ... by the way I said yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's been very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nA Eric and I talked about this at links to during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go head first on\nShaping your message on what this is all about stay on target if you don't stay on target and they're going to shape it for you and you're going to lose or what he did to me it was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough this lens players perform a service for the owners and the entertainment ... they have no other rights or concerns they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut it'll Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called him selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being cut it off the field he flipped the middle finger to his own sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't to burn his Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\n[laughter] who got your Jersey money though [laughter] if\nYou if there's some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about this story with JR Smith that came up recently in NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all of this question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns and putting that in quotes like who owns\nThe ... and when did they do a stress I Do sometimes but yeah I refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah talking about them as owners the language of sports is very specific right I think the anger that comes\nWith hearing some some of these decisions is the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right so the NBA says dearest with actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices Eby says the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg\nOr he says the money is more important to my kids when she did say I'm just gonna keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like Earl Thomas and St GR Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is if there's a lady on building a field as we've seen with to see it was often\nOften doesn't go the team is bad losses a crew people get fired in that just because you wouldn't pay somebody they're worse\nMy guess for this

Thirteen endings weird season on Sunday they started the day with the best record in the national league forty eight hours later after two games at home they're finished\nYeah I mean we're ... when a home game though you know I mean you know when it's gonna run exactly right you know they kind of weird team all year though yeah you know they went through the styles of what looked like after the chimney yet unfortunately one of those hit at the wrong time\nMobs of lately they scored one run or fewer forty times this year and still one Ninety five games so I guess they should get a medal for that\nYeah outside of the red Sox winning a hundred and eight games with that Bolton that sat on the top just motion explainable second tier\nIt's incredible the only team to score one runner fewer more times than the cubs was the Orioles and they lost a hundred and fifty engaged so when I started winning Ninety five with that sort of me and my coffins is doing something there was news this week in a novel move tennis channel will\nBegin showing wait for it tennis\nMore specifically the women's tennis tour which went out on its own and the disastrous venture would be in sports for the last two years women's tennis outside of the grand slams has been virtually invisible meanwhile for the past five years many Los Angeles Dodgers fans haven't been able to watch the games in their market because some cable networks won't carry sports Mitt LA\nWith the combination of court cutting in contempt you think people are realizing that life goes on or if you're just a die hard sports fan do you just wait forever until these corporations figure it out\nYeah I think both are true but I also think there is another phenomenon going on and that is the phenomenon of finding a way to be a fan\nWithout attending games that without necessarily watching on TV [laughter] I mean we always to be a financial betting\nBut now you can be a fantasy fantasy sports you can be offensive memorabilia all kinds of ways to do what you can be a fan through media nostalgia yup what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most stuff\nIs a phenomenally to staff decision that the NHL made years ago to get off ESPN and not just for starting this right or when they went to ... but they got a spike TV for the playoffs remember that I watched like you'd be surprised before that they went to sports channel\nYou know they were ESPN's only professional league you at that time and time and he asked he ended up you know they did it I'm On the SPN they did what he SBN dot which is a high on the moon and then they moved on to sports you know that's what this reminds me also\nKnow they made a big mistake and I think the good news is at least if you're a fan of W T H tennis and I am 'cause I watched the women as much as I watch them and I'm happy that they're back it'd be an actually watch them for the season and you know finally Charlie you know show would be complete without at least some discussion of the Cleveland Browns but here's a story about it\nCooler full of Budweiser not Bud Light but Budweiser that it will open when the corn ... when its first football game of the season great idea right\nYeah I don't know if I may I don't know if someone bar and I was doing this but okay they're just making philosophers that cooler is likely going to stay close for at least a week\nBut here's my question what happened to Nebraska football if you are of a certain generation\nMy late mother in law was from certain the brass got her brother and her father and grandfather all play football for Nebraska\nI mean I think they've been crippled I think by conference realignment and by the fact that the whole nature of college football changed the thing about the bracket teams was outside people like Johnny Rogers and Tommy fresher they were big goons say would beat you to death yep over the all up and down the field\nAgainst changed it to a very big people who are really fast and I don't think the press has ever really caught up on that\nNow we've come a long way since Tom Rath men in Roger Craig huh there you go and you can find a sports writing Charlie Pierce some Sports Illustrated from time to time and he joins us each week on only a game thank you Charlie banks are [noise]\n\nYou know the same game recognized game whether it's Aaron Rodgers and ... the Brian

an apple pie casting or wherever you\nListen to pod cast and while you're there and leave us a review you're helping listeners find our show and helping us raise our game [noise]\n\nJimmy Connors maybe America's greatest tennis player Arthur ash maybe it's the most influential\nThey couldn't stand each other ... really dislike anyone who had a kind of brag a dose you anyone who ... themselves and the way that Congress did that's University of South Florida professor and historian Raymond arson oh he just wasn't wanted to attack anyway always gave everybody the benefit of the doubt\nBut as a member of his family told me once the only person that he really didn't like on the tour was Jimmy Connors one was brilliant but craving the other a quiet revolutionary with a powerful sense of patriotism here's only games Gary wallet on our their ashes clash with his greatest nemesis when that unfolded on and off the court\nThe quarrels between Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe probably began with the Davis Cup the annual international team tennis events that dates back to Nineteen hundred according\nTo Raymond arsenal their attitudes towards playing on the U.S team were diametrically opposed\nI think I asked him into a tremendous amount to him because it affirmed his notion of self worth ... that he was a citizen a proud citizen and the the was respected enough to represent his nation\nAsh was the first African Americans who represent us in Davis Cup competition he had played on the U.S team in eight different years by the time Jimmy Connors was dominating men's tennis in the mid seventies but Connors refused to join the team did irritated at ...\nYou could never understand why Connors didn't share any of that sentiment that it doesn't mean anything to him if he did make money out of it he didn't seem to want to do it\nIn June of Nineteen Seventy four Arthur Ashe was elected president of the association of tennis professionals a new governing body created to represent the interests of male tennis players\nThere's never been anything remotely like a tennis players union and the national federations around the world and tennis promoters really making all of the decisions and the players felt that they were left\nTo join the ATP instead he kept playing as a member of world team tennis or W chi chi\n[noise] in Nineteen Seventy four\nDouble duty teeth filed
