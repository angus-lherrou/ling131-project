events more at news in slow dot com news in slow language learning through current events\nI'm Carrying given and it's time for three stories you should know we're going to start this week by analyzing a new scientific study I'm not joking but I promise that will be fun I'm joined by Michael ... of the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you both make severe thank you Karen\nSo I don't normally follow the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend Patrick ... treated out an interesting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits\nAnd football would have been ranked number one for a psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be attracted to risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions and no answers and ... what do you think so\nFirst of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me ... just because all the research shows that\nBull and the thing that I thought looking at this study was just that\nThe psycho social benefit seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends\nYeah well I I don't know if I have an issue at high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner like really little kids\nBut I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community\nAnd you have the whole town behind you you know I Know from my years from cover in high school football I Know just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raised the self esteem of the athletes that perform because you've got eleven guys on the field as one\nIf you play high school basketball the gym maybe Mt if you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across the country [laughter] but [noise] but football I can totally understand why it's viewed\nPositively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been just suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football and sad that they don't really need to\nTell 'em in there with that yeah and I'm totally ... reservoir and yeah yeah yeah and you know\nTom rainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older but\nWhat was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football slide football like would would that would that community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter] I'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do [noise]\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution pay the\n[laughter] leave that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the in sees one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospects from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WNBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness everybody signed with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom your perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys are on age\nAlso the G League does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability of the hiring agent to sell their likeness and assign shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the ... sort of wine a day waking up and deciding like oh we're going to do the right cool\nCome from is right or at least as I see it would be that the threat of\nElite high school players going to the ... league instead of being one and done would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] I mean I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is if\nThe alternative is a good enough one that can actually be a source of real pressure on the instead of light which would be the first time that there is an alternative that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think I could work but Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA issue so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these have high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here and it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players but I Do you know super it has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players and ... that hasn't even like they don't\nThey're not even on to not only ... and the fact that they would maybe Maureen as the better television do you eat\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one\nA minute [laughter] I totally agree\nI I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love seeing her play and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward mill um athletes much more specifically than we do females\nWell we I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WNBA is significantly lower than eight to twenty five percent right and center ... sort of ... percent\n[noise] so as it is only a game tradition we save our most important topic for the last ... who\nYou yeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just today is from a column for the spotlight investigative\nTeam I wrote a piece recently about touchdown and big play celebrations\nIt was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more\nI Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system a figure out how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff\nAnd I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players said was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and this that actually happened during the cold got an interception a couple of weeks ago in a game and they were down by two scores\nAnd they started celebrating like doing this day and there was the end zone cameras got them and obviously on TV you see the score right below and you're like ooh guys rough and I'm going around and they're all saying well you\nCan't I mean you can't celebrate when you're losing and I'm thinking in the back of my mind and this is why I'm not a professional athlete\nBut can't [laughter] I don't know how much earlier [laughter] I just believe in everybody's right to hype them\nUp I support that as well and like if you pick up Tom Brady you should let everybody know you pick up Tom was amused don't but if you're getting your butt kicked you just look kind of silly\nI Love all of these you know it's so funny the NFL and its football traditionalists student way of this for so long and they were like football as a team sport it's

Nazis well look at athletes who stand or sit or\nHe's with Charlie Pierce hey Charlie ... it's not normal for us to start the segment by talking about USA Gymnastics but these are not normal times we're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former presidents did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common that we start to segment we both argument using true and for all the wrong reasons\nThis guy's on blue since the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy random sports organization right and you know lamb and they have to track him down to ... burger and that and bring him back to Huntsville, Texas\nA grand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing document you\nAs does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either a disguised trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against usa ... we're going to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was an which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter] right right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first up\nDoes the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right next question [laughter] the second issue to me as a bit more complicated\nIn September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker blackout the swoosh on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame\nI might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the ... in which Mary Bono so not became qualified to run usa true true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what can USA Gymnastics do at this point to at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fuel run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states in God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help us oh\nCharlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nNo because we're smart Karen and more people to listen to it [laughter] no I mean the basic probably NFL had with the whole anthem thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation on Jerry Jones\nBombing narrowed down in Houston a Gerges soon and kill and those guys have been pretty much marginalize if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and and once cooler heads prevail\nOr they realize that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend\nWhat I really love about this story is that they actually came up with actual data that showed that treats made by the president didn't try fans off to football what turned fans off to football was those owners speaking up right and finally Charlie I Want to draw your attention she they can yeah ice lions because the country only hasn't it\nNever played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nFirst of all I Want your church so bad apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of\nFirefighters and then Crosby image and and played for the [laughter] ... which we don't get\nThe last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one this isn't a funny one this is an author and McKinney even have you got you can't really put out which is pretty good considering most wanted skate before last year\nThere was a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and says is it really huge [laughter]\nI've always been that you can sell hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could sell hockey in Kenya I Hope the ice lines practice very hard and are in the next Olympics they will be the biggest thing there you\nCan find the sports writing a Charlie Pierce at Sports Illustrated from time to
