Mehlman petras that law a history professor at the new school in New York City was walking around her apartment\nJust kind of procrastinating by checking Twitter and I just saw that all of a sudden my whole timeline was\nRetreats I'm with you know various kind of enthusiastic commentaries about um oh my God I Can't believe he's doing this\nThis was the moment when Colin Kaepernick the former Superbowl starting quarterback no better known for protesting racial inequality within known as the new face as Nike's justice campaign believe in something [noise]\nEven if it means sacrificing everything but well people in Italian timeline expressed surprise that Nike hat aligned itself with such a controversial figure petras that law had a different reaction\nI Am a historian I think historically I'm always like you know where did this come from and so having spent a lot of time looking at Nike's ads my first thought was like okay this is totally part of this tradition of moving the needle with kind of controversial branding that\nPlaces sports in athletics in the context of something bigger\nOnly against Martin Kessler takes it from here\nIn the ... moment Petra zealous says Nike's tradition of socially conscious branding goes back all the way to the seventies\nWhen they released their first women's running line they name the shoes after kind of\nAll these like cause I feminist sayings so you know there's like the liberator today it all seems kind of cheesy like\nBig deal women's empowerment branding but back then you just didn't have a lot of that\nNike has run ads featuring Paralympic ... runners who are overweight or in their eighties and in Nineteen Ninety four the company reached out to a man named Rick Munoz they wanted to put him in a commercial here's wreck\nI said to myself if they go through with this\nIt's just going to be unlike anything that anyone has ever seen before just do it didn't really go into this territory and then you know using a person nobody knew who who is this guy he's the nobody but he's got a story that\nRick Munoz has always had good handwriting that's not like you want it to feature him in a commercial but it's a good place to start his story ... grew up in LA without his dad\nWithout any siblings without any grandparents without any aunts and uncles just him and his mom\nAnd you would think that there would be this super duper closeness between the two of us are and there was actually the opposite she didn't express affection she just worked all day came home cook dinner and we went our separate ways\nSo when Rick teachers started telling him he had nice penmanship it mattered the only people who could give me positive feedback where the teachers Rick focused more and more on his handwriting about a decade and a half later the same sort of thing happened when he started running\nRick was late to the sport he was already in his twenties\nBut more experienced runners were quick to complement him on his times\n\nThis is the public's radio it's seven twenty\nSupport for only a game comes from Geico offering the guy comb overlap the Geico mobile app stores ID cards enables bill pay and submits

should now we're down to just fourteen vying for the world series and I know one of our guest this week is very excited about that Sports Illustrated Charlotte while they're welcome back thank you Karen I'm thrilled to be here\nSo Jason gay Wall Street journal I guess that means you're playing the role of the person who is not excited about this baseball season I'm a bit of a loved about everything current you know [laughter] All right let's take it away\nI'm super excited about the red Sox which made being in the press box when they claim strictly I got\nI got some bad luck by like couldn't watch for the end of the ninth inning because I was so nervous and I would freak out and they want and I was like this is wildly unfair you know and like that\nDid you on cork champagne or or\nOr what it was like cracker jacks wind up in the air and the ... um no but I think\nYou know I was super invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because you know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting in the postseason since two thousand four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about the series is that I went into it assuming that every fan would be jazz for the rivalry\nAnd yet when I went to Fenway in Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as\nDedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was slain\nBut also the red Sox and the Yankees these current teams are kind of a likeable did\nJerk for that rivalry to be really if\nThey know Jason that exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot and not to like\nAbout Aaron still a lot more for\nGoing in the locker room and I get yelled at by Yankees PR for trying to talk to him and judges like sorry like he was very nice about it All right Jason what do you think\nI think the Houston Astros fares are secular road dogs they were so\nAnnoyed that they had to play all their games I Wonder where they play their games at eight in the morning for the roads are on the Yankees are playing\nPrime time the actors are just fed up with all of the east coast media bias\nSo speaking of east coast media bias we should acknowledge the media bias of this panel which is we are three Red Sox fans right\nI mean Jason doesn't care about anything\nI studied it and I said and I had a lab you're you're wearing Red Sox Jersey so it's just join and get out of favor roosters [laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend Karen I'm I'm a Homer\nBut Jason what you just said about being said it is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like their new and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWhere a lot of never satisfy Karen hadn't the game you\nRealize care and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox horrifying was just it it and they have waited long enough to children\nAll right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about Jenny butler he had an exciting return to minute it's him or her whole practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my finest numerous sure that's what they're going to do and saw the lines\nAnd I was gonna say is it not the right way for it to come to think it was the wrong thing to do well okay thing to do I think that\nI was on okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do what I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes\nBut has frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when\nThe NBA's enters into WW showing what going to let\nYou go to Mars you know we do a little concerned about ...\nAbout my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler new exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nDon't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like man but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on timber wolves campus for this melt down with advanced warning\nWas somehow a bit of choreography on team bottlers part gee I don't\n[laughter] scary and also I have seen\nYou walk into the studio saying you bleep and ah [laughter]\nI don't know if you are one of the cast stones you know this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these players are kind of superhero like and they have enemies both on their own squads Anon squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte and made the point that the media is being used here and as a member of the media I'm just going to say hey I don't like being use really\nUnlike will give me those clear\nJust just just use me a bill whether our gang\nYou probably know that once more the Alabama Crimson Tide of the number one college football team in the country\nAnd you surely know at Alabama head coach Nick Saban hair is once again so ski unless it's really nice but\nAll is not well in Tuscaloosa because those ... good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided\nFootball games but once more Nick\nSaban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire for their paltry attendance at Crimson Tide football\nGames his poor Crimson Tide players look up in the stands in the middle of games and it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there [laughter] but here is a thought for Alabama plays some exciting football games that begin at reasonable times Nick\nSaban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte on a Saturday does he realize that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter]\nAlso Alabama was playing in Louisiana Lafayette me no no disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but you know what the score was at halftime what was the score it was seven\nHundred and Ninety five thousand dollars [laughter] okay I was forty nine to nothing it was forty I Know nothing about half\nPart of this is a little weird of it take I realized pardon me kind of Caesar he's coming from okay I Want to hear and I do because like here's this\nTeam that you have you've devoted your life to making this insane powerhouse and you are the best college football team that has maybe ever existed and then people stop going to your games I'd be like\nWhat I like are you kidding I did this for you [laughter]\nI mean I also did it for the millions of dollars and the prestige and the chance to you know do whatever I Want after this but I Do kind of understand which are like you were a fancy\nParents traveling Sports Illustrated corresponded now you have been to these\nMajor college events you know that big time college boards of two thousand Eighteen the last thing that has anything to do with our students boosters vision and prime sponsor\nOkay here's a thought maybe they should pay the students to go to the game\nNow Charlie while they're out of it and the tourism needs to die why would get you out of bed before noon what I Would like to figure out a number\nOn it doesn't take much for a college student in college if you paid me like twenty bucks to go to a football game and ...\nDollars now I Believe this is an NC double a violation of an iron Leslie\nViolation and paying the players right you can also give me just like a pair of sneakers and an escalator\nOkay and then I definitely [laughter]\nI mean to me this whole thing reeks of like kids get off my lawn right like his\nOld man yelling at cloud right like\nStudent attendance numbers are down across the board in college football schools are having to do more to it\nIt's okay to be emotional\nAnd it's okay to stand up for Johnny unite us it's okay to stand up for him um he was a great

most WNBA stars where men signature shoes what gifts but now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie\nOlder women you all you want to talk about his shoe\nSpeaking of shoes Philadelphia Seventy Sixers synergy oil indeed has signed a five year jail with Under Armour it'll making the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote there's a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that because she's look really weird and a size Seventeen\nYes I mean as someone who bought at a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on yeah which I Believe we're using as a car for the problem with with that they looked fine on the big men\nBut when you put them on a shelf they look like art auction [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle NBA who has charisma beyond belief um\nSo I mean he's going to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean you might want to think of his own the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he sent you I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he says he can do at all which I guess means you can shoot\nWeapons which means the coach except for the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers have just had a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked few\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm of the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bride big enough\nTo make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back to what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt in New York Times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutors say the victim is the university's fans might say it's us but the New York times suggests that it's Bryan tags Bowen whose father agreed to\nIs now playing in Australia\nWell there's nothing wrong with playing in Australia has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull is going to be fine I think he's going to do was apprenticeship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high but again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized\nBy these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event to star Christiana ... of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which we're now although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow we're in all this lawyer is saying that document with acquired in a computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school I think certainly burden of proof is on run although when his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden\nOtherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right 'cause it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr Ronaldo was capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot in your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is to figure out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get confused\nWhat can we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean it's a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're gonna get offenders the opportunity to quote Benson time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting it's a good idea\nYou know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson slice put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing going on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what with mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe was\nOrdered by it'd be Wyoming by the way in this game Seventeen to Thirteen\nBut they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald\nHe had some sort of injury that they did not want to disclose somebody came out onto the field warmed up wearing his Jersey [laughter]\nYou know throwing the throwing the potato to throw the guy out is or what did he this is a real thrill back to the the wild west days of sports and I love it I think it's probably something you can only use wants though you\nCan find this worth reading of Charlie Pierce at Sports Illustrated and he joined us each week on only again thanks Charlie Gard
