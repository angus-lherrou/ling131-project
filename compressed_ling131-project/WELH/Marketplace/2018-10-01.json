first of its kind in the U.S we've got Jenna McGregor to talk about it she covers corporate governance\nMe run down and what this law is and who will be affected by it\nSo California Governor Jerry Brown just signed into law a bill that lawmakers there have been trying to get through for a long time to actually require companies that have their principal offices in California do you have\nWhat we'll start with at least one female director on their board\nDid do most sports include women already I mean how how unusual is it either to have women on boards or not have women ...\nParticularly large companies most have a woman on the board large publicly traded companies but uh their numbers show that about twenty five percent of companies headquartered publicly traded headquartered\nCompanies in California do not have any women and so they're trying to fix that issue through having a mandate of sorts it will grow over time over the next couple of years they're
