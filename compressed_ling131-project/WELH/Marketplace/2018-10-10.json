budget this year is more than double what it was in twenty four teen outreach aimed at people like the friends of Twenty one year old scholar Reinhardt who lives in northern Virginia Reinhart is

mercury\nI think you're seeing a new registrations for both parties at a higher clips that I've seen in the mid term in a long time\nHe says the GOP hopes to pull in younger voters along with everyone else but some campaigns are also focusing on places like college campuses and high schools\nThere's no one size fits all but you do see a whether it's activities are local events are fares mailings to voters who just turned\nEighteen next Gen Z Wessel says the increased attention and funding is a recognition that the old strategy wasn't working\nSaying look our job needs to be to register motivate

time to show up and vote in Washington I'm Kimberly Adams for marketplace [noise]\nThis is going to sound a little cynical and I suppose in a way it is but that doesn't make it not true kids and I'm Talking really young kids who are or a market there a market that can be catered to continue to be created for and from which profit can be made\nThe corporate example at hand is YouTube and its influence on the youngest of consumers Alexis Madrigal is a staff writer for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised it by ... book on the program thanks for having show talked about how you came to work on this story\nI have a two year old and a five year old being toddler to YouTube and I was like what are all of these things all these brands I've never heard of\nThese companies all over the world and I watch my daughter becoming totally absorbed in this kind of animation that to me it's kind of pre Pixar if you know what I mean\nOh okay you're lots to unpack in there because\nIs it as it sounds so Derrick channels on YouTube that are built specifically for you know when you're old ... year old three year old is and that's what I call toddler YouTube and it's this kind of\nWild place well [laughter] I I almost don't even know what to say uh the premise here is that is that really young kids in this economy have tablets and phones and they're on them all almost as much as adults it kind of see\nI mean YouTube is by far the most popular grand among children and even little children have their own favorites to one of the biggest brands within the space has called Chu Chu TV they have Nineteen billion view is they have twenty nine million subscribers this is a global\nChildren's entertainment ... kids love it they can't get enough they watch them over and over and over and over\nAll right so maybe I'm being naive here but I'm a you know back when the analogy you make in this piece is to PBS in public broadcasting in Sesame Street in children's television workshop from like fifty years ago now in in the American economy\nAnd the ostensible reason for all that was to educate not necessarily want a two year olds but\nYou know slightly older toddlers and and give them a leg up is that\nMission of of toddler YouTube and and true true TV is that what they're doing\nYou know I think right now they're in a transitional place they bent entertainment they bend just\nTrying to capture as much children's attention as they possibly can and now they realized that they've done that\nAnd they need to deliver them something better and so what I'm hoping is that this global phenomenon of all these video producer it's on YouTube will have a similar revelation and do similar work to create YouTube it's good for kids rather than just something that sets up their time\nWell so spit bullet for me do you think that's gonna work because you know not to make the American analogy on everything here but there were researchers and educators and and government regulators in some sense talking to the folks who are doing children's television workshop is there a sense that there's that infrastructure beneath what toddler YouTube's doing\nNot really on the other hand they can benefit from you know fifty years of research on children's television but the media environment the media business there's obviously a much different\nAnd the biggest difference is there's just YouTube basically dishes where kids are going this is where the whole businesses and say YouTube itself would have to be the one that sort of maybe tip the scales for educational content within the algorithms that determine what people watch\nWhat do we know what do we think uh it's actually doing to the kids setting aside from it or whatever educational benefit they might have we know what being attached to our phones and our screens does to grownups what about the kids young kids\nWell I think you know the the worst possible impact is that essentially that kind of attention grabbing fast paced content and the ability to switch between those things very quickly maybe sending kids up to expect a kind of pay thing that's actually not educational\nAnd that's kind of the big worry that we sort of induce kind of attention a loss and kids\nAlexis Madrigal he writes for the Atlantic his most recent piece is called raised by you asked me what you want to show
