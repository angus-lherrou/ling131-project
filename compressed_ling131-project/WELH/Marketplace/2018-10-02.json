S. but not to the dimensions of that I needed for this specific project it was a exceptionally large\nSo it was sort of a three headed cow and uh it was outside of the capabilities of any of the American producers\nSaid the last time you were on marketplace you were scheduled to appear before Congress to talk about your application for an exclusion from the steel tariffs which was denied a how did that appearance go\nWell the the experience it was everything that you would imagine you know the the stately boardroom when hundreds of people watching you and um I think it\nIt went surprisingly well like I made my point and there were some changes made to the exemption process that accommodated\nMy concerns as well as the concerns of the three other companies that also testified alongside me my main Bush was for the exemption requests to be retroactive to the first date they're submitted not the first day that uh the Commerce Department decides to look at the request and entered into their system\nAnd that still didn't give me the exemption I'm Still working on that\nI'm now talking to US Customs for the correct a import code they there was a discrepancy with that so it it's a it's definitely a bureaucratic process and I'm not happy or not made whole yet but I Do feel like we made significant progress by testify\nWe've been talking about the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports I'm Wondering if the new terrorists on two hundred billion dollars worth of other Chinese goods or a classy you at all did us tariffs effect here\nYes these new sections real one terrorist do affect our day to day business with regards to the sanitary fittings that we provide in food factories it's basically just lead to a a industry wide pricing cruise which will and turned be passed down to the consumer and it'll be reflected in the price of a food\nYou've been dealing with this all summer I had a whole nuts\nAnd especially when I was what kind of holding the bag on on the large\nOrder things were were tense and there was a lot of stress you know that that was a a deal that could potentially go bankrupt the small companies such as mine but you know with these new terrorists\nFor him a little more relaxed and I have been but it's a these are still uncertain times or as I mentioned pricing is is it changing story day to day and uh in just overall uncertainty which is also risk and ah it's a risky environment right now to be doing business we're holding off on\nA major capital investments and we're just in sort of a holding pattern\nRight Todd Adams we've

big storms like last month's Hurricane Florence recovery is not only slow but expensive some estimates put the damage at twenty to thirty billion dollars for Florence and a portion of that will go to repairing the beaches affected\nThe U.S government spends a lot of money repairing coastal communities after big storms Lisa song as a reporter for ProPublica and wrote about the high cost of beach re nourishment\nAnd how that money is divvied up welcome Lisa\nThanks for having me at least that can you tell me what beach nourishment means well\nIt's basically when the government comes in and they pump a lot of sand onto your beach to a fix the damage to the beaches that have occurred to erosion or through storm damage\nAnd the reason why a federal state and local governments will fund this is that without beach nourishment some beaches in the U.S particularly on the east coast in the Gulf Coast\nAre just getting smaller every year um they're retreating and so the people who own property on the beach obviously want the beach to stay where it is and those beaches are very important to the tourism economy\nHow much does all this cost and where's the money coming from\nIt costs a lot um so many of these projects are mainly funded by the federal government particularly the Army Corps of engineers and FEMA in total cumulatively the U.S has been about nine billion dollars to rebuild beaches since Nineteen twenty three\nAnd when we looked at the north Carolina data after Hurricane Florence we found that in that state alone federal state and local governments have spent more than eight hundred and twenty eight million dollars cumulatively for those beaches\nWow and what is the argument for spending that money\nSo the local residents would argue that they need that money to keep their tourism economy going to keep their properties up and that you know people from all over the country coming enjoy these beaches so the government should help fund their economies\nThe people who benefit the most from these projects are actually the property owners of ocean front properties so these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansions right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "02"}
