it's like a huge image animals drummer right [laughter] or even worse Jimmy Fallon gets your gym again we're well yeah 'cause I think I'm\nA first there's a little if there was you off a little bit you know people have history like I just didn't pop up you\nKnow out of out of nowhere but um ... what do you ever look around and say I'm a kid from Philadelphia what am I doing it more [noise] more or less a it's how did I get here often when I go back to Philadelphia I'd do something called chasing ghosts\nAre still in my first car and I keep it up I'm Sorry you still have your first car ... yeah and I go to my mom's house and I get it and usually I drive around when I go to Philly I'll drive from like\nMidnight to three in the morning literally just chasing ghosts and the thing I always do is when I go past\nThe place where the roots used to a mosque on um fifth in South street yeah I'm always like yellow like back in Nineteen Ninety two I thought Nineteen Ninety nine was going to be the future you know yeah let alone what I still be a thing in two thousand Eighteen I\nMean I'm not one of those knock on wood people that I don't want to jinx it but as he knocks on what I as I as I did it you know hypothetically but I I just I'm Amazed that no one's kicked me out the pool yet\nYeah we we had um we had ... on the program ... about two weeks ago and we had a whole thing about she got limited what radical during you know and she's doing really well and I don't know or you may now and she said oh honey you're never made\nUm yeah and even you know this is our our technically are twenty some professional year as a group and I I still work as if\nThis could all end tomorrow that's why people ask like well you do so many things have Nineteen jobs like when did you get to relax and just do in my mind it's it's always this could end tomorrow so\nDon't ever sleep you know does it ever surprise you that you have become that guy now to people turn to for advice and mentorship and\nI'm I'm very uncomfortable with that even my Twitter handles says like I'm I'm Better as a student not a teacher like this whole costs love is ...\n... you write your bunch of rappers called me like oh gee [laughter] now I I I kinda shrug it that what would you be\nHere without the Tonight Show I mean you you said that you looked at it that the nature of it as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nI'm I'm resilient so I Would like to think that I'd always be into something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that the Tonight Show opened up\nEven way more doors than I expected like I I truly thought this was going to be the most gentle mercy killing\nEver know as I said I [laughter] I'm just laugh [laughter] not all that does\nYou know because I I was reading on the op eds and even though I Love being underestimated huh someone someone had a road in a a and a block once like\nLike oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots\nExcept this uh Tonight Show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus going to New York some are changing man and I was actually like good this is what I Want I Want to be underestimated 'cause I wanted to I Want it to to kill all a\nPerceptions of this being a square gig or do do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed late night music [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing\nAnd we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block and it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start being on Snapchat and that sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music\nThere there were other avenues to explore and we took full advantage of it it\nIt's interesting because there is a lineage right there's doc severance and from the old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable down in an interview and the roots\nThat's where it and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of services in saving my water like one day that'll be me it's just making the most of it again like in two thousand eight when he proposed it to us that\nWe should say you you didn't take the call for a long time yeah I was like I mean we just got to to a place where we were making good money on the road like why will return\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably or was that our domestic personal lives huh kids were getting older crime or at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there's a way that we could Celine Dion our way\nInto a position that [laughter] you know I like to use all the stuff is ... Celine Dion our way into a position where we could still make a good living without having to\nHave a ... for him and be on the bus for nine hours and that's where it and then just fell into our lap and it was like be careful\nWhat you ask for there's a ... there's been a good old marketplace in and you know ... management on your here but I Lived for that stuff well well good and in fact that's the really the question right because you have said more than a couple of points\nPlanning something is the joy of actually doing that something and the question of the out of it the question that comes out of it is what's it like to work for you how do you run the ban how you run the how you run your guys on the show\nUm you know it there's there's lessons to be learned about it because again where we're at a phase in our lives where we're not twenty two twenty three like that here was forty five now yeah a ... a sign of um\nSo the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a row and that sort of thing and we used to do\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that sort of thing not to mention a lot of our side projects\nWell it's weird because one the roots is just one of Nineteen things I'm responsible\nWhere were actually having more fun with each other socially grit that we've ever had I realize that we're going to fall apart if\nAs people we weren't hadn't form with each other you know what I mean so I think now just were in as as a unit [noise] this is the best it's ever been\nWe're gonna enter either thanks for coming here was originally [noise]\n\nComing up if you're not one of the very large players you better be offering some niche products\nTrue in life true also in retirement planning but first sure what the students\nEven around the world was I don't know about this down ... off five forty five to ... percent twenty five thousand dollars to the to the action Ninety two points one point two percent Seventy three and twenty nine\nIs the five hundred dollar fifty seven two percent twenty seven twenty age their banks dip along with bond yields Wells Fargo drop one point eight percent Citigroup give back to enter just present bank of America declined three percent they energies dogs to act as oil prices hit a two week low Exxon Mobil\nDown three and four tenths presentable arrow given them three and a half percent Chevron down\nOther reports ... percent they don't airline shot up three and a half percent after posting profit that exceeded expectations company started Hebert ... higher not have your higher revenue first and business class passengers Jet Blue to load two and a half percent they bond prices rose get this deal on the ten year treasury note actually felt\nThe day and a frequent one four\nPercent you're listening to marketplace\nMarketplaces supported by grown owes HR payroll talented timekeeping in one unifying system designed with a streamlined implementation approach for small and medium size businesses across the globe\nLearn more criminals dot com criminals workforce innovation networks and by Drexel University Drexel University is academic design and transformative cooperative education program prepare visionary leaders to address the challenges of a changing world\nMore at Drexel John ... slash ambition can't wait and by ... the software platform for digital transformation using artificial intelligence and I do teach to solve previously ensemble business problems learn more in the three I O T Don AI [noise]", "show_name": "Marketplace", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "11"}
