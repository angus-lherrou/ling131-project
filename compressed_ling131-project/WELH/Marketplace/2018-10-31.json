thousand eight would be just about the worst but sometimes you got to play the hand or Dell right so ... did taking over a CEO and president of Charles Schwab from Charles Schwab himself ten years ago this month\nAnd to hear him tell it which we will he's actually had a pretty good decade well that and You're welcome to the program sir\nThanks a lot ... it's great to have the opportunity to spend time together or as I noted or in the in the introduction you've been at this company ten years which means uh you took over ten years ago in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country's seen in a generation or more what what were those days like for a financial services company guy\nYou know at that point in time there was very little that you could do the the outcome that your company would experience as a result of that crisis was more the result of the decisions you made\nPrior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis so are you going to work every day just kind of hanging on for the ride\n[laughter] no it wasn't quite like that I think uh I think in my first Ninety Days a CEO I was a successful in having the stock price there probably are and who does that have made it a decade who are able to achieve\nThat yeah [noise] um what is it or was it I suppose uh about financial services that they got you're going I mean you've found your first Spanish services get your own financial services company when you were like twenty what two or three or something\nTwenty two actually my uh my formal training was as a pension actuary sigh provided consulting services eventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems and where the money ... and we linked up with Schwab and\nOver a few years we became Schwab largest client and then ... required\nMy farm a few years after that you know your boss Charles Schwab who is still the German the board and and are active in the company as I understand it also by the way like the second or third CEO I did in this series lo these many years ago but but anyway uh yeah I'm a ... he and ... and you will\n... originated the concept really at scale of discount retailer brokerage and I wonder if you look around and see that everybody is catching up to you 'cause fees are going down and and all of those things are happening that have to affect your business\nI don't think there's any organization that's generating the net new assets lows that we are the new households lows that we are the new account so so I don't I don't know that I Would go so far as you say people are catching up to us but more people understanding that\nIt is important to not only deliver quality service and quality advice to investors but also do so at a value that leaves more money in their pocket that's a good thing\nYou know we're we're a large institution three and a half trillion dollars we're focused on building an organization and rewarding our stock holders communities employees but but ultimately it all originates with whether we are doing the right thing by our clients and I'm a whole lot more proud of the fact that we also generate less revenue per die\nSo ... so does your mind when he was you know you feel that way to generating less revenue come on\nAbsolute less revenue per dollar because what it ultimately means chi's relieving more money in the pocket of the investor and and and it was her money to begin with I mean our job is about helping them get outcomes that makes sense\nAnd to the extent we do that do reward us with more business I think that's a whole lot better way to grow then to try to extract maximum revenue from every client in an ultimately I Would say\nThat chocolate view that is maybe one of the most important legacies of of his founding this company over four decades ago how often do you talk to him every day I just left his office about five minutes before I got the headset on burn up\nShow if businesses good uh what do you worry about as a guy who as you said managers reunion something trillion dollars worth of other people's money\nWell certainly the cyber ah environment to significant risk for for all of us um you know you're talking about thousands of attempts every single day\nTo try to access clients' accounts for access systems and and of course the financial environment our country and really around the world is predicated to a great extent on trust and\nTherefore or any organization like ours has to think about cyber at the top of the list\nWell Benjamin president and CEO Charles Schwab both thanks a lot of pressure to to try and thanks for your time today [noise]\nDo things about that interview first of all and full disclosure careful listeners will know and everybody should be where the Charles Schwab is an underwriter of this program also you can hear well well ...
