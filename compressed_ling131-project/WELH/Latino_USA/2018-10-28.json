order diner no table just a couple of Congress and\nThe sound of a male female making drastic one [noise]\nI've been positive that like the next people mhm because of our own kind of history in this country that we're going to be bringing a different kind of politics yeah right and I'm just wondering where like you know what you think about um [noise] that notion mhm\nTo be\nThe next or to be like the na\nOur identity is the most I Would say is the most intersection identity in the world so for example I'm Puerto Rican that means that\nI Know that I Am African I Am indigenous\nI Am also the product of European colonization\nI feel like to be like the ... and to fully acknowledge your identity and everything that goes into your identity means that we have to be in the causes of everybody in order to champion the causes of ourselves and so\nWhen you look at an issue like immigration for example\nThese aren't just quote unquote Mexicans coming in from the border these are these are indigenous people\nAnd this is their land [noise] what were your mom and dad\nSpeaking to you and saying look Sunday Anita ... with the rigging yet what do you want proud like being a war was a message like look on Sunday that you're in New York or through and through however you want to define yourself\nYou know I was I grew up\nWith a very strong sense of patriotism a very strong sense as we are American I also was raised as you are ... like through and through and so I grew up like the music I grew up around\nWas Hector level the ACLU's and then hip hop in\nYou know growing up around the brand your favorite hip hop artist would be boys hard\nI grew up around my public enemy and knives Jay Z and then of course you have like this late nineties boom of I like your fat Jamal you have big pond\nYou have all these people that we grew up around as well and so it's it's to be all of those things you know sometimes people say like\nYour platform is still intersection offs and to me it's not even that we're trying it's this is who we are and so what what it means to be American and what we grew up and like how we grew up around these values was\nMy dad will go visit family and what do they go every year but then we would drive to colonial Williamsburg what really yeah you mean like for the weekend well I mean we would take a little family vacation and it'll be like ... and you were young yeah those are like a two places where we went on family ... she cry\n[laughter] it was colonial Williamsburg and for thirty going out of the ... that's ...\n[laughter] how do you manage that as being a young enough you know a lot of people don't know if they you know it's not like you're walking around member of Congress dreamy with you know what I\nI'm an at the same time knowing that you're going to be in Congress\nI think I'm Still processing a lot of that four months ago or five months ago I was completely anonymous or just like any other New Yorker no one cared about me [laughter] so just like psychologically that's been that's a process but I had a friend come over a couple of months ago\nAnd there was a magazine that had my face on the cover of it with a bunch of other faces in terms of political developments of or political ideas of twenty eight teams and she looked at it and we were laughing at it 'cause I was like it doesn't feel like this isn't my ...\nThis is an island but we're laughing at it and she says that's what you are you're in idea now\nAnd I felt like I had to be perfect or else I was going to be letting our community down\nSo that maybe they just are an interesting question are you managing your ego\n'cause I mean the truth is is that you're getting all kinds of call backs right and what is the kind of mind games that it can play because I'm sure it's also exciting to be on the cover of a fabulous magazine or a great photo shoot and all of that but at the same time it's also lonely\nIt is and if anything there are some ways in which I was more confident before the primary\nIn my brain and in my heart I feel very grateful and I feel very humbled but a lot of the sixth grade says terrifying I feel like I have this huge target because I'm embodying some of the most vulnerable people in society\nAnd the issues that I'm Talking about or not read versus blue they're just not their top versus bottom and so\nFor me\nI still struggle with even conceiving\nThe idea of getting a call back like sometimes I talked to our team and I'm like do you think so and so would respond to us now like yeah of course and I'm like will they or I still worry about people showing up to me that\nThere was an article I think it was in the New Yorker where they've made a point of rain that when you talk to your kids you come down to their level mhm and I was thinking about that also in terms of the way you you said you know you talk to people you approach them you come in and you'll touched them you'll be in yeah\nAre you thinking about it more as like well this is a really affect the political tactics world no no I\nFeel like I learned it from my parents and when I reflect on my life experience I think of my my parents were\nFunnily enough my parents were never political\nYou know my family would always come over and we would talk politics around the kitchen table but my parents never organized or did anything like that\nWhen I think about my experience I think of\nSo good at building community\nI went to public school\nAbout thirty minutes north in a small town in West Chester but I didn't live that kind of class experience because in any affluent area there is an underclass of people who serve the people who live there\nAnd that's what my family was my mom clean the houses of the kinds of people that I went to school with\nMy dad really struggled to start his own small business\nTo help support our family but it was always struggling growing up and it was really just picking up you know towards towards the actually the end of his life and so my mom would invite the cashiers from the local Dunkin' Donuts over to the house\nGot fifty throw into talk because those are the people that are family could relate to they were always about leaning in to people and the politics come second\nAnd that's how I practiced as well\nEven though I feel very strongly about my beliefs my number one job is to care about people and to lean into them show them that they are cared for\nAnd make them feel hurt because I Am hearing them\nWe talk about the politics\nWhat is your Buffy same to you when you're hearing your dad no I don't know I think [noise]\nI don't know it's like a soap ocean although I'm Sorry no it's All right that's right oh my gosh [noise] no it's okay what is the crime tell me what your [noise] um just because like\n\nNo one's asked me that question so\nIt's weird because like I guess I'm not I'm processing this has you're asking me but it's like um [noise] it's like having someone walking with you the whole time and there's some ... and then like you're going months and months and months and no one's acknowledging the person next to you and then it's like oh what does this guy I think\nSo it's it's a little emotional but um\n[noise]\nThe last thing my dad ever told me before he passed away [noise]\nWas make me proud\nAnd for a really really really long time I felt like I felt like I had failed my parents because of the situation we're in my dad had passed away my mom was back to cleaning houses I was tending bar and waiting tables and I felt like\nTo be depressed that it's something that\nIs normal um also that it's okay to be flawed you know because we don't really see characters like that very much [noise]\nI think we're expected to be like I like the title says we're expect to be perfect both in\nSociety and within our families and that's just not realistic at all and so I just want them to know the\nI Know that they exist\nIt's okay it's okay to be who they are\n[noise]\n\nThank you for putting it into words Eric ... is we really really appreciate your work being you so much I really appreciate your interview

to combat the troubling trend of Latinos not finishing college\nAnd a couple of weeks ago we looked at the future of warehouse jobs\nMany of which are filled by young Latinos and ... and we wondered whether or not these jobs offer a path to the middle\nClass [noise] these stories were part of a partnership with the community service society of New York a nonprofit that among other things conducts demographic research\nTo help in their mission of fighting poverty in New York City their data helped bring you these stories and today I'm sitting down with lives are Christian he's the organizations director of youth policy to talk about some of that data that they've gathered about Latinos and education in New York City over the last year\n... ... ...\n... ... lives are when I first met you you were like probably the geek you were like look I Love data I Love numbers the whole world makes sense to me because of data numbers and there are a lot of you out there in the world [laughter]\nAbsolutely I think we live in times where what people are talking about can be a little bit uncertain and I find comfort in basing some of the things I talk about on real facts and figures\nOkay so every person who loves data has a story behind it you like this really wonderful story about what inspired you to do this kind of research and data so what's the ...\nThe particular line of work that we're talking about stems from one day I went with my parents I'm guessing about ten years ago to see the terrific show in\nHeights like Washington Heights affect the way could they wake up but I got this little plug\nBecause I actually grew up in Washington Heights where the shows about and it's a Broadway musical by minimum around\nI mean I thought Josh gene so\nYou know it's a terrific show and discipline and all the glory of Washington Heights with some differences to the community I grew up in it showed three communities within Washington Heights\nAmericans Mexicans and Puerto Ricans all living together and most interesting to me dancing to the same music all listening to salsa\nWhereas my experience to having grown up in Washington Heights that wasn't exactly the case it is a predominantly Dominican community and actually never heard salsa until I went to college\nSo I started thinking about well I thought it was really great that the show put the communities on the map there is a diversity within the Latino community that as a policy wonk myself\nI wondered if it wasn't getting out that actually the the different communities within Latino Americans some of the New Yorkers aren't being showcased enough so I started digging into the\nDate a little bit to see well if I were to tell a slightly different story that there are real differences among the different Latino communities what would that mean for the new policy field that I work in\nSoon what did you find what\nAnd in the new policy field so much of your policy when it came to dealing with Latino you dealt with issues of English as a second language and English language learners and the first thing that jumped out at me was that\nYou've got three really distinct communities that Latinos in New York the three major groups of Puerto Rican Dominican and Mexicans and the largest one Puerto Rican New Yorkers really have no English language learner issues over Ninety percent\nOf young people of Puerto Rican origin in New York speak English as their main are are are best language and are born in New York City so I started to think well\nIf the policy field is sort of lumping all Latinos together around this one issue what are some other differences that we could find and then once I started to dig a little deeper a lot of new things started to come to the surface about differences and the communities\nBoth ways to make them great and the way that we can support them to be even better\nI I really I Love this particular point that Dominican women have higher college graduation rates in New York City than any other demographic in the Latino population so what's up with that\nIt's really interesting I think there are a lot of questions that are raised in a lot we can learn from particularly in comparison to to some other groups but Latino non Latino\nOne thing we think is that the Dominican community in New York like in Washington Heights is interesting in that you have a lot of groups from different incomes living together because it's a relatively new or immigrant group as compared to Puerto Ricans\nThe schools that are majority Dominican schools you have both lower and higher income families from Dominican origins and what we find\nIs that when you have mixed schools around socio economics the culture pervades all the different groups in the school so the college going culture of the middle and higher income Dominican families really pervades the lower income families as well which is why in those schools you really see much more of a college going culture and among women in particular\nWhich is it's real bright spot [noise]\n\nNow in comparison the Puerto Rican community in New York has been here much longer and you find that some higher and middle income Puerto Ricans in New York and other parts of the country aren't living in the same neighborhoods [noise] so where there are some concentrated Puerto Rican communities in areas of New York you're not having those mix of incomes in the school and college going culture may not be as strong [noise]\nHalf need each so there's a whole conversation around desegregation of data it sounds like a very technical thing what would it really means is when you're taking big data and you're kind of make it into smaller\nBite sized pieces is that a conversation that is being had regarding Latinos and let the method the United states increasingly\nI think we're seeing the value of diversity in our analysis and now I think the next step is we're such a diverse community within Latinos how do we really show the differences within them and a show the needs and strengths of different communities\nAnd we're really on and exciting frontier as people start to think about diversity and identity differently\nOn the United states census\nBureau's animal Community Survey which is really the baseline survey that we use for so much of our work\nThere's a question about race and then there's the next question about ethnicity\nSomeone race people are largely answering whether they considered themselves white black or an Asian background or other", "show_name": "Latino
