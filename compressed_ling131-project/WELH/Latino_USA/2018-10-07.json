and pipes and it's up to me to stop the suspicion [noise]\nIt's like a video of like people playing you post on Youtube videos of themselves playing games yeah and then they other people like love to watch yeah I don't understand why but yes yeah it's like a whole thing I don't get it you know but like this has seven hundred thousand views and it's just like this dude\nAnd like driving a forklift around and trying to pick stuff up and like put other places yeah but when I think it's funny too and I want to show us like if you look at the comments some people are like giving ...\nActually drive forklifts ... and the reason I ended up watching this weird Youtube video is that I've been spending a lotta time doing research on the future of jobs and the economy and in fact I found out that a lot of our future jobs involve forklifts\nAnd that's because one of the fastest growing industries in our country today is the industry of moving and storing stuff especially stuff that we order on line\n[noise]\nPer we're going to start our show by diving into one of the fastest growing parts of the American economy it's warehouses [noise]\nWarehouses\nHardly in between space that all of this stuff from cat food to fuzzy socks flows through on the way to us and the industry is exploding\nThe twenty third team then\nPresident Obama visited an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee and he gave a speech about the future of jobs in America with a particular focus on getting a better bargain for the middle class\nWomen find it all with us from the worst recession since the flood\nOr the Gulf millions of Americans are jobs homes and their savings apart and one of the world is laid bare the long term ... it's been happening when it comes to middle class you're\nObama talked about bringing back manufacturing jobs but he was also there in Chattanooga to highlight job growth in other sectors Amazon had just announced that it was hiring thousands of workers for its warehouses nationwide\nNow over the next two years experts are saying that the warehousing industry needs to hire over four hundred thousand workers just to keep up with the growth and e commerce so the jobs of tomorrow\nAre actually warehouse work\nAnd many of those jobs will be held by Latinos and let the nuts currently in about forty percent of Eighteen to thirty four year old working in the where housing business are Latinos\nOffering immunotherapy and other personalized treatment options to address patients individual needs\nMore about precision cancer treatment at Cancer Center dot com\nWelcome back to let you know usa I'm but yet you know horse and before the break we are from high school students who were learning to drive forklifts and how to organize inventory in order to prepare them for working in warehouses\nNo our producers of buddies that car is taking us to a real warehouse where these young people might work one day\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nIf you remember Patterson, California has all of these warehouses over by the highway and it's a perfect place for them it's empty flat and just a quick hour and a half to San Francisco\nOne of those warehouses if Amazon\nI reached out to them to see if I could come take a look around and\nAnd visiting the facility gave me a sense of what the future of warehousing will actually look like at the commerce gross especially when it comes to increase automation [noise]\nI entered the building bears just this wall of turnstiles floor to ceiling the kind that you see in the New York city subway\nAnd there are signs everywhere that said no photos\nOnce a guard like me and I realized the break time\nTons of employees are streaming out through the airport security style scanners\nThey have under our feet\nWe also have way more than a hundred full time\nI get a tour of the facility from Danny to for you to introduce herself as a community specialist I'm not sure what that means\nIn fact there is a lot of Amazon specific language I hear on my tour Amazon calls are warehouses fulfillment centers they call all their workers associates entry level jobs are known as tier one and over and over again I keep hearing the phrase fulfilling our customer promise to Oregon [noise]\nWalking around there or stop signs in a lot of places and lines on the ground\nLike roads which is good because\nIt was going to suffer [noise]\nMe we'll see another one and all them ADD\nAG these automatic guided vehicles basically it's like a forklift loaded up with items but it's totally a man and it follows a map of the warehouse floor programmed into it\nIt just wishes bias\n\nEverything in this warehouse is yellow and gray except for another kind of robot that works here they're bright orange\nWhen you think of robots isn't always let people have in mind this is Lauren\nLynch who does communications for Amazon they're\nPerson shaped robots more like big orange room bus their squares and on top of each of them is a set of shelves which holds item\nOperate in this\nSo this is how it works say somebody really wants to order a back massager they click it online once they do that that's when the item gets\nProvided the item item\nAnd they want to know how many they need\nTo pick the back massager a\nSecond worker calls the orange robots over retrieves massager from shelf and then puts it on the yellow track kind of like those airport security trace which go on a conveyor belt\nThey didn't accept that I played that we're going to say\nStation is what it sounds like basically the massage or comes in on the yellow tray and the worker packs it into a box no robots here this is a place where someone gets to see all the secrets of what we order online\nAnd today that someone is a very peppy actually if I can sell us\nI Want to know what is the weirdest combo stuff she's seen someone order you know\nI asked her how many items does she have to pack a day\nWell I Know an hour they want us to do about it\nSomebody would do an hour here and so you can do that we had hours a day\nWorkers normally do for shift so we do if you do the math actually packs around two thousand five hundred and twenty items a week\nSo the very last thing that happens to your back massager is that it gets a shipping labor all of the labor at this point is done by a magical puff of air\nShipping label is created and gently place in the air on top of the\nSound of air placing an accident shipping this hard I have to admit is literally my favorites [noise]\n\nThe robots Amazon pretty amazing and on the way and I pass signs of a mother's room and there are vending machines that I see two\nThey're free to workers with items like ear plugs lotion Advil just this week Amazon announced that they're raising their minimum hourly\nWage to Fifteen dollars but over the last few years Amazon has been grilled about their working conditions for example public records show that thousands\nOf Amazon employees are on food stamps Amazon says he figures are misleading because they include people who only worked there for a short period of time or worked part time and a book published this year by a reporter who worked undercover at an Amazon facility in the u._k. details that workers often wouldn't even take bathroom\nBreaks because they feared not making work quota and\nThat workers were actually penalized for taking six days\nAmazon responded that they didn't recognize these allegations as accurate they also said they coach people who aren't making the quotas and that their attendance policy has changed these kinds of conditions are part of why employee turnover at Amazon is a very high\nWhile I'm at Amazon I asked learn about the\nYou know we don't have and power over white individuals make the decisions they make to stay in a career or a role for whatever period of time they choose to but we are able to do is provide a great work place with great team members and great benefits\nA consequence of so many workers turning in and out of warehouses is that it's really hard for them to push for their rights if they have concerns there are no unionized Amazon warehouses in the United states\nAmazon primarily believes in an open door policy we believe in the ability to talk directly with associates\nOpen door policy basically she's saying that they'd rather have employees talk to their managers that they have a problem than work with a union to voiced concerns [laughter]\nSo without\nWorkforce are these the jobs that the graduates of Patterson high school really want I head down to Los Angeles to place reckoning with these questions [noise]\n\nThe warehouse workers resource center is located in Long Beach on one side of the room is a wall of photos of workers protesting on the other side\nCenter is one of the only organizations in the country that advocates for warehouse workers they trained people on things like wage theft and how to file for workers' comp\nFor injuries at the warehouse center of the day I visit is Wayne Wilson he's twenty five and he drive forklifts for local warehouses\nAlike working in a way as good as ... you know your muscles as a child would go into\nTwain's been working in warehouses for the last seven years after he dropped out of college to start helping his family his mom got sick and he helps out paying rent and bills the biggest problem for him though is the lack of consistent hours the Wayne doesn't work directly for the warehouse he worked for a temp agency\nAnd the agency is supposed to have him working at the warehouse forty hours a week but\nSometimes they don't want them sometimes they do last week the only woman on the so\nTwain sometimes lines up at five AM in the morning first shift at six AM after being called in and still gets turned away sometimes the only one full week a month doing shows me his phone\nHe tells me photos to the sniffles or okay so\nYou'd have senior manager and the work tomorrow he says not tomorrow say can I resort friday like you know stick me anywhere and he says that this may Thursday night to see if I don't know the names on Thursday new taxes I worked in a while he does know\nYeah but some of that is a constant threat of that basically yeah\nAnd after moving up and getting off the temp hamster wheel green says he's never even seen a way to apply directly for a full time job at the warehouse that he works at\nBasically warehousing companies use temp agencies because it's cheaper temp agencies provide a steady stream of labor to warehouses that don't have to worry about recruiting workers or managing them they take money out of each worker's hourly wage and joins us as a temp agency doesn't tell them how much it could be a dollar ten dollars they don't know\nAnd the lack of work or a steady paycheck makes workers less likely to speak up because they don't want to re sacrificing the hours they do have\n... case he says he'd like to go back to school maybe become a writer but that's not his plan right now\nThe kind of ... going to school the things that is do\nI Wish I didn't complain about ... to go any more [noise]\nNo it's not it's not about being confrontational it's about seeking connection it's about allowing elected officials to remember who they represent to connect their humanity to your humanity\n\nI was asking myself that question of whether I wanted to tell my story or not and in that moment\nI just went with it and they said you know I I was five he was Fifteen\nAnd I shared at that time when I was five with two adults not my parents who either didn't believe me or didn't know what to do that information they never did anything so they just understood the lesson that\nWe are not believed and these boy understood the lesson that boys will be boys\nAnd I don't want my children to learn that lesson\n\nI Want to believe that in our country we actually listen to survivors\nAnd it was a very painful moment I cried after because I realized oh my God maybe my father moved here at these way maybe my my hearing these way [noise] and then [noise]\nIt didn't reach them but then on friday I texted me that\nInteraction with flake and they say that you might hear something in the news I Want you to know that I Am okay and he said I'm Sorry I was not able to protect you and I said to him it was not your fault and it's not my fault and they feel very supported by you but you know that fear was confirmed\nI didn't tell them I started because I didn't want him and other people who love me to\nHave to hold that pain\nAnd I'm not doing it alone like I'm doing it with all these women and I feel so much in community with thousands of women I have never met but whose stories I deeply deeply understand\nWhen you see what happened in the moment with Senator Flake how do you connect that to the kind of activism that you've been doing and developing on immigration how do those two worlds come together in that moment for you\nA lot of the conversation about a survivors has centered or the stories of\nWomen kind of without talking about the rest of their experience of who we are I Can't separate me being a woman from being let the now from being an immigrant from being a mother and now accepting and embracing\nI think the the history of these countries the history of the struggle for inclusion of morals us and the promise of freedom\nIn some ways the the act of bird dog named Senator Flake people will say it is your most overt political act in some deeply human ways it's the least political act\nYeah [noise] I think it was the mother and me\nHonestly that came out there is a quote by a seat activist Valerie ... so the mother and meet asks why didn't lettuce leaves darkness is not the darkness of the two of them but the darkness of the warm\nWet if I'm married that is not dead but a country waiting to be born what does the midwife see she says when we are in labor cheeses breeze\nAnd then Bush because we don't breeze we'd die if we don't Bush we die if we don't push America today but if we push with our labor and our love and our vision we\nWill bring these country
