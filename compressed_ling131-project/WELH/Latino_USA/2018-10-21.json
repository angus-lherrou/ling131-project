[noise]\n\nAnd we're not the only ones who noticed this\nSeptember when NPR poll has sheriff held as his favorability rating among young people ten points lower and governor addicts younger voters are important for Democrats to win in any state and one third of eligible Latino voters in Texas or ages Eighteen to twenty nine\nBack a large portion of Latino voters in this state where the Latino vote these heat [noise]\nBut here we are at a college where nearly half of the students are Latinos and letting\nUs and none of them are at this event\nSo there are a few things that could be contributing to it seems to be a lack of enthusiasm for ... days particularly from young voters the first problem to share of has his name recognition not enough people know who she is\nAnd part of this is advertising and that comes down to money which the sheriff has a lot less of than her opponent governor Abbott has raised over sixty five million dollars in campaign funds compared to the sheriff less than half a million\nBut there's something else at play here something that goes deeper into ... as a candidate\n\nDuring the Democratic primary jolt Texas a political mobilization group for young Latinos\nDidn't endorse the sheriff's endorsed her rival Andrew white they said it was because of her record as sheriff of Dallas [noise] they pointed out that during her tenure Cher sell does cooperated with federal immigration authorities by holding immigrants in her jail cells when requested and handing them over to ice\nWe spoke with ... at a young or from Joel buddies concerns and he said he was disappointed when the sheriff didn't have a good answer about this at a forum aimed at young Latino voters in April\nI count ability record hurting\nThe New York times reported that one of the students who was in the audience to dance a forum said quote you were a Latino when you were helping deport people so why should I trust you now [noise]\nUs she didn't have a choice she was required by law to cooperate with ice and in fairness she did famously go head to head was governor Abbott and twenty Fifteen she was refusing to honor ice requests\nAnd says since Andrew white lost the Democratic primary jolt is now indoor seen her for governor but ... says oh\nWe actually got tax I documented and\nI asked ... whether she will take on what some of the younger progressive want her to do to protect undocumented immigrants things like fighting to shut down detention centers and to stop deportations\nSame wired to go to that place but I don't have that power this is a federal issue that the governor or you know I wouldn't just make a statement I take action action can be taken in this before\nIt's before is cruel bill and is affecting the documents that is something I can do\nWhat she's talking about is the ban in Texas on so called sanctuary cities it's a law called S. before and it was signed by governor Abbott last\nYear a Governor Greg Abbott he broadcast the moment you know Facebook Live video as our son in law liberal than sanctuary cities in the law essentially forces local police to work with federal immigration officials and\nIt allows police to ask people they stop for their papers it ensures that law enforcement officers in ten and we'll cooperate with aren't\nSure if this opposes the law and has made it one of the biggest issues of her campaign she also supports allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in state tuition but\nThen we ask her about another policy that many on progressive are pushing for\nIs abolish ice part of it\nI used to be reform\nAnd I've seen about is the original task advice was to keep people out who do harm they've got away from them and it needs to be reform but do you honestly want nobody to make sure\nThat another attack on a major city is is not going to happen do honestly just want him to let them come in and and do an attack on the city's sounds a little republic and what you're saying I Know it doesn't it sounds\nLike we want to protect our country\nMm\nAnd so maybe some Republicans might like the strong borders national security rhetoric maybe she can make up for the lack of enthusiasm some young Democrats\nBy winning over some Republicans but that's not going to be so easy given how polarized the parties are these days when we were in Odessa we met her Republican voter out the Mexican restaurant who told us\nAnd then he used that when to create confidence in these towns or at least the appearance of confidence and use that to sort of plow forward so we know for example that he went to farmers branch Texas\nAnd said I did this in valley park let's keep going there was internal disagreement within the city council about whether they should keep going whether it was worth the money and he said no I can do the same thing for us for valley park and so they press forward ended up spending more than nine million dollars and they are law was entirely struck down\nLike we're not talking about towns the size of Dallas or the size of New York city\nIt's not like they spent nine million dollars and they were like oh wow like they spent nine million dollars and that meant that they couldn't move forward road construction and so this was actually a material sacrifice on the part of these towns the only person who appears to have a really benefited from this is Kris Kobach\nSo if you think now about you know that strategy earlier to what's happening in the United states right now I'm you know what is what is the larger narrative that you see that's at play here in this moment in the United states when we have Donald Trump in the White House and directing a kind of particular perspective\nOn policies regarding immigration you know I I think\nThat prior to Trump getting elected and prior to Trump\nBeing as hard line on immigration has he has been it was really easy to dismiss people like Kris Kobach but now now does elements of the Republican Party are leading the country and he has a much more impact will voice than he otherwise what I think that we\nCan learn from what he has told us he believes and\n[noise]\nI think that it is a sign
