it is it most of the prize winning British also cake got concern\n[noise]\nWelcome to well book club thing to be here when it's lovely to have you here and I wanted to ask you about something I read you sang in an interview a few years back you were talking about how you were getting fed up with talking to people actually [laughter] I I guess you off but you you said in that interview that um\nYou you'd rather likes to be a non ... did make a very good non is that true I didn't actually remember\nSaying that but I Do have thanked me\n... cents as I did one spend a week in a poor class confident they are they sitting down and she never come out of their lives right and that comes on once every hundred years to the public\nAnd said they have they called him ... said they have a number of nuns who live outside of ... you could do it with the outside world so that intense can then stay inside and the ... and they have dogs and pets and they will ... joined the sandals and\n... and I was very taken with what they are and I don't think I could see a good life to me I Do I like um I like being at home I like including myself\nWell ... ... may indeed have been a successful known but I always have been terrible now [laughter] well I think she could have been successful but what what is on Dr did the truth is that she is a successful writer ... behind the scenes at the museum one ... ... and since then\nShe's accumulated nine focus on history prizes\nTo afford anything yet but I wouldn't bet against it\nThen in terms of readers cakes books have sold eight million copies around the world and all of them live off the life is today Tom most popular\nTo describe it simply it's the life story of an English woman called us you told who's bone during a snowstorm in February Nineteen ten ... dies well when a\nVault on when does she live or die and those who gives her a whole range of death some accidental some note in one story she was beaten to death by an abusive husband\nBut then there's another version of events which that particular disaster is voted it's so so ah she was being provided with chance after chance to get it right\nThe normal range is fascinating questions about fate and pre destination is also if you all for moving story of a woman trying to live on ... through the duck is decades as the twentieth century\nBut throughout this an additional pleasure and watching the ingenuity with which case shotguns and rescues a heroin onset sub at once again on her feet\nAnd case I Wonder if you'd stop with the reading for life off the life this is an incident uh in one version of events where you'll unfortunate as heroin doesn't survive all those will be another ... at this point she's just a four year old child and she's playing on the beach with her older sister Pamela\n[noise] come on let's go and jump over the way it's a sad time and it was ... but in a nice way and as soon as NATO was happy to for them and have plans and even if she wasn't she still went to them within\n... you know give them more but then you have to have to talk to them that because that was that role and heroes it's to be a kind of a you know after ... women because she's a time I think\nBut if I were to write another novel based around folks corner which is my recovered desire I'll have to say because it allowed me how rich you know the place I Want to live where everyone wants to live than it would be Mr Shawcross the story the next door neighbor because I I think she has actually much more interesting stories in Sylvie to trial\nOn Monday to ... and was Sylvie Jen is that is the ... to go to play with him misdemeanor and is now a new thing and independent life\nSicker written in ... between Sylvie on and it is if you're hot hot springs much younger and ... she gets\nUs it's a very good with I think Sylvie yes I think ... is he eats a nicer possibilities I'm she doesn't\nDo very well with her life are possibilities that has to say but I think so ways\nParticularly I think I'm making supposition state 'cause it's not necessarily something I've written and I never think you should talk about things you haven't written because they just don't exist but I think if he if he's war echoed as it was because she served in the in the ... you know the messages and the first World War and I think\nSylvie can see it not that that's a woman who did something and the Sylvie has only been a life and a mother and I think also being a wife and mother in\nNineteen ten is a very different prospect from being on now so I think if he shows something that could have been an is annoying because she's not done the best which I think is probably so recently looking at it but you know is he is an ... to everybody really\nWell to me I I I Know I I Love is the I mean she's she's just wild child up fault always comes up Trump's always helps us ... through the various crises of a life I I think she's extremely attractive our writer [laughter]\nTo best selling author does your does such an age wise to license one of us she lives brothers up but I just it makes me wonder because you know how you fall in love with characters in books he was definitely an old many attractive or interesting charges and book she was my safe\nBut I just wanted to use and also other than a Sheila and presumably the center of your attention was that there was one you particularly enjoyed\nEnjoy while I left Haiti rather obvious it does yes because he's a little boy and but you I like ... I like ... so I think he's a really started ... English character you know he's a gentleman and and\nRather put Conan not entirely fulfilled yes it's you know she was full of who's thoughtful seeming extremely boring I'm prone to ... a drop of a hobby for what he does he does open up to become the support of her life right now he's much stronger than we think\nWe have we have a question though from an Iraqi Canadian this is the b._b._c. World Service a ...\nAnd this is taking up all based on the earlier question about whether a Sheila remains consistent whether she ...\nShe says some just talking about all the characters in the book she says yo noble takes us from zero to ... from one story to another from one tragedy to another ... the main characters us you know his mother father brother teddy and so on remained constant why is that\n[noise] um well I never saw its right to any different needs to be honest I was surprised how constant psychiatric I some I sing seems to go to law school reunions [laughter] say no more\nAnd I to sixty three so I'm going to fifty year old six to even go actually didn't even know how many decades\nWhat really surprises me is how little people change he says the same goes as they would then essentially and gates I always think of myself as someone who's changed hugely others I noticed at a concert on because I wouldn't be the only one who had done that so people do remain constant and it's just what happens to them and it's interesting\nBut also how we understand them because once I Love about the ... who met one of many things I Love is the ... the characters you think all of\nA sudden way actually you got to realize that much more than ... those uh those uh she was falls or you ... your crotch and you realize is the tend to loving won a set of parents but also her older sister ... who is kind of\nWell see I see the same way as you as you describe for not reading but I mean she use good old ... or do you think she's already stole the dozens boring actually she's far more acute\nSuddenly about well politics for instance a sitter and she she ... she's costs of smoke puffs and she's not boring until\nNow now you've got your cat just have to flower I mean sometimes they have to do the opposite and close up and sometimes they have to be sent to offer them killed [laughter] sad to me but I think you have to see\nSee the workings of the plug on them I mean that sounds quite mechanical because it felt life I mean you know it's not like these we are living life couches and close to a fish will say you have to work with that and and make things happen and that's that's the fun of writing is being able to take charge\nAnd to move people around and make things happen to them and ... with them often\nChat [laughter] quite I can get her to these days I used to used to hold back but now I'm I'm not afraid of this this ... [laughter] true but\nThat's how I Would also reading from life off the life now this is I'm involved with character who is one of the most unpleasant and the entire book [noise]\nAnd where we are is that this is a version of events or she lives met um slide the aunt is he in the tea room in London and\nThe one porch some overcome by just terrible sense of ... and it'll just wants to stumble out to both I Need to explain that in another existence when we read about before\nUs it was in London and tripped and smashed ahead had a terrible accident and she was helped her feet rescued by Amman cold Derek all the fun a\nName not typical she ... me off to get married and uh she'll play off of that in a jealous rage he too so [noise]\nAnyway that was another life in this life us or is just called me sitting in a in the tea room waiting for is to come back because this is just put all of them knew\nWaging patience if I had to return when suddenly the terror descended swift as a predatory hawk\nAnd anticipate you dread if something unknown but enormously threatening it was coming for here among the plight ... teaspoons Sosa she stood up ... she got dizzy and it was a veil of folk in front of her face like bombed us she torch yet\nYou've never been boomed she pushed through the veil after the Russian TV to hiring to run it\nJust started to run and kept on running onto the Bronx and rather than blindly into education gardens she'd been here before she'd never been here before\nThere was something just dumped site to just around the corner somebody she could never chased down something that was chasing her she was by the hunter and the hunted like the folks she carried on and then stretch on something footing St John John knows the pain was extraordinary blood everywhere\n... says anyone on the street that then from behind during ... said oh my how awful for you at me help here you know not oil it'd be nice to of course Scott off it's not the kind of what was it ... my name's Derek Derek all this and\nShe knew them for if she didn't have that voice the past seemed to leak into the president is if you ever thought somewhere what was it the seat just spinning in the past either way it was nightmarish it's her in a dark landscape had become manifest the inside become the outside\nTime was active during that ... percent and\n... and thank you very much and did not function of events the recall a scientist inside quite pleasant he's\nA climate [laughter] I mean I think he just ...

[laughter]\nAnd then you have to forget there was such that you did and you have to write the fiction and that's when you start going back can and and checking in putting things in and doing well so it's a it's not easily quantifiable for me these days research because sometimes it just doubled sitting in your garden reading a book that\nSomehow I feel like such [noise]\nPick up since since like you very much\n... I'm Kathleen O'Connor from Northern Ireland originally my favorite chapter in the book is the one written from the German perspective and I would like to read more around this particular topic\nAnd my question is what was your favorite written source in your research from the German for say this\nIs this is at one point or in one of her life is a Sheila is in Germany ... living in Germany she is she's still a British woman but she's she's a um we do see actually about ... to ... some ... from from that side of the tunnel\nI did become obsessed with Eva brown or ...
