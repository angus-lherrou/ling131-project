correspondent but if you'd like to hear more of the stories behind the headlines from around the world to join us again next weekend here on the b._b._c. World Service\nDistribution of the BBC will serve some us was made possible by American public media with support from the three R O T addressing the world's most challenging problem so the convergence of artificial intelligence ... tea or the ... cloud computing more it's the three R O to your daughter the art\nAnd progressive insurance committed to offer and streamline shopping experience were home an auto can be bundled together that's progressive learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive\n[noise]\nIssues will publish rated eight or nine points for ever [noise]\nReporting on the shelf posted in your ... book published radio\nAnd UMass sharpen journalism ... [noise]\n\nMakes you realize that it's not it's something that has to be looked at that has to be dealt with as soon as possible\nAnd I think we work they're racing which one can relate to the body landscape thinking of space is not just as things we go through but actually the particles were breathing that affects our constellation the way we are it affects the way we think\nLooking at trees observing the landscape and I think that we stop the work\nIt's the connection with the work with a buddy with the elements the invisible don't tangible to an end that way you can actually bring things together and make us think about how we're leaving in the space in this environment\nOh civil and he's been described as an ounce his to expose the link between the west everyday luxuries we did that you mentioned environmental impact on African ...\nWell I think I Would go farther than that not only thinking about the west or thinking about the um African countries I'm from the African continent I'm Nigerian\nYou'd be bill but I've lived in different places and I've traveled to different parts of the world ... once you start realizing that once you take something from one place and put it in another place that you're actually shifting\nYou actually change in the constellation of that space so we can think of the Emirates we can think of to fire we can think of the skyscrapers and we can imagine that a lot of Saddam has been taken out of the grounds\nTo be able to make locks we can then imagine how much time do we have used to be able to make that\nThe relationship is not only about the west it's about different parts of the world and how we're working how we're shifting things from one place to another\nHow we're making wholes in other places and creating structures in other places and that also affects the erosion of that place it affects people moving from place to another I think it's beyond the west\nIt's really talking about the movement subterranean movements the visible movement the non visible movements between places\nHow do you make not visible through the you what\nI can give an example of a war called impulse you took bling which was actually a work that I I first went to Namibia and followed the railroads and the colonial quest of that period so early twentieth century and how materials like cop poll was taken out all\nThe minerals were taken out of the ... mind and the work is a constellation of twenty nine tables also top histories\nAnd it shows different processes that shows materials in transformation so we can you imagine my cut transforming into isolation pods for NASA for cars for I ends we can then look at the work in a circular wastes a turnaround the work and it's an installation peace\nOr the other works like the way to cause which is a tapestry peace where you have to buy these\nPulling and on fighting with a structure and in that structure you would have images of holes of mind areas of cracks and the work is called ... says really thinking of what the legacies that we have to reconstruct and that one\nTo propose something for the future another aspect of my work would be to use poetry as a way of thinking can think of the work that I showed it was a piece\nOf future will be certainly fractured malleable stressed to a certain tension and will we be able to handle the stress\nOff about what was your reaction to the needs to the United nations that we have just twelve yeas to prevent catastrophic climate change uh when I heard\nThat actually I I started laughing because it seemed quite a short time um when we think of it twelve years and meanwhile the policies and the structures are the laws are not aligned to be able to change things so quickly\nWe were told that we need unprecedented changes to society seen the way we now have decent that will happen if the next decade well\nIt's very hard to say I'm an artist\nYou know when you oh\nYes definitely I think it might need that certain events and such an manifestations can take place in certain places for people to understand how urgent it is and how important it is to rethink the way we are extracting\nHow we are working with our landscape and how that is affecting every single being every single element\nOn the planet and I think once we do not feel it at our doorstep spent it's harder to understand how all the places are going through extreme change or extreme damages through the different kinds of means we have used to exchange our environment\nThan I Do know his ... and ... a Monday eight opens next
