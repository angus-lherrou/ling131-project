Need help or I'm addicted to heroin\nWas like that [laughter] where did that come from\nWe were so nice when I first heard from ... to London had heroin problem\nI couldn't even spell it you know the first time I sent my sister a message about it later you know it was said you're spelling it like a heroin or novel I was that unfamiliar with it and also it was not something that was part of our media no one was talking about it in fact the first time when he went to treatment\nRoughly had excellent health insurance we got her in right away um she got excellent treatment she wants to detox and while Lindsay was in treatment for us you know I went to our first Alan on meeting which is a support group for families\nAnd I can remember sitting in a room listening to these sad people\nAnd I'm thinking my daughter's back their detox thing you know in five days this is going to be out of her body and this will be over for us and I kept thinking this really doesn't apply to us and I was so\nSo naive because I'm six weeks later we were back in the same facility because Lindsey it already relapsed\nThey were just at the beginning of lenses ugly struggle with addiction that has lasted almost a decade I can remember to this day it's like\nWhat color dress\nYou want me to put on you for bringing all you know might have it ready\nAnd we began to understand this is a disease this is not going away this this is something that has come into our home in our family and we're going to have to deal with it you know initially\nThe most powerful tool they had something called case he's law that lost loved ones get a court order to force someone who is addicted into treatment it's the result of the campaign waged by a Kentucky Woman who lost her son Casey\nWe initially filed cases law was in two thousand eight two thousand nine and at that time unfortunately it was relatively new the judges were not extremely familiar with that and I I always say that wasn't cheats and the law and Lindsey knew that\nAnd so when she left the treatment center there were no consequences to her but we were very pleased to see the second time that we filed in two thousand and Sistine that there was cheese in it and that went on the left\nAnd violated the conditions under which she knew to get back on track they arrested her they they issued a warrant for her and she spent thirty days and the
