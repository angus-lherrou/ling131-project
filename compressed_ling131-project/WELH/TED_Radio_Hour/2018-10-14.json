I'm not you know usa this afternoon at four on the public's radio eighty nine point three of them\nThe Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy\nWe're in the Nineteen eighties you I guess you you started out as a as a public defender right\nI did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating\nFrom law school and what was what was the idea behind it you thought okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise]\nThat's right and I like lots of people had no idea what was going on now criminal legal system and my third year in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense connected and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes for justice [noise]\nUm and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients but their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from Robin ... and ... and you know\nRead 'em nonsense of fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery and mass incarceration it always has that we all know the shocking numbers the United states incarcerate more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night and America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete jail cells who have not been convicted of anything these mothers and\nAnd sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nPrice is called male\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount in their own discretion\nI have seen it as low as a hundred dollars for the people that we represent on the clients that we see bail is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system\n[noise] so if you are charged with crime and um you're going to have a court hearing it could be four or five months in the future if you can't post bail you're you're stuck in a jail\nAnd the the Bruins play at Springfield [noise]\nThis is the public's radio support for the tide radio our comes from Amazon Web

Americans for the arts it's the\nTed radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raz\nAnd on the show today ideas about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven was at the [noise]\nWhat have you looked at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing\nIt's OR Books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes they're legal things\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity of legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nBut person isn't anybody who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way I mean like\nAnd we're persons but slaves were\nNot sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be persons [noise]\nSo the ... does not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons baking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing [noise]\nAnd see them why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals that's a cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer I\nKnow I read Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless the billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person that are legal rights for a non human out when I knew it was going to take a long time\n[noise] so your objective at that time was to essentially changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much time to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal\nRights to animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was he got himself baptized because he wanted to get a set of God parents because the Eighteenth century slave one of the ...\nDo a skate and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart that hired slave captures the Kansas City of London signed him bring them to shift the ana marry that was set sail for Jamaica were James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Summers that\nAnd I have to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in illegally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make that\nDecision right off the bat because James Summers that was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain the shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on drink twenty second Seventeen Seventy two\nLord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Summers that underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as ... concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your Jane summers at of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and ... and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on we filed a hundred and sixty\nPages of affidavits and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of new and where were they being held captive\nWell Hercules in Leo were being held captive at Stony Brook university at the age of two professors had taken them from their mothers\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learn more life lock

foundation who is clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's the Ted radio hour from NPR\nI'm Guy Raj and on the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random selection of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nThose who were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interests with making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the countries and making sure you've had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime ... to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different\nSo the wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bounce ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it doesn't that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes John out of some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry a scratch the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams access and it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people to all three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one solution chamber once with fish and buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in a typical political out place and go well why do we need that for about a but this is a path to old is the ideal\n\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these in out parliament's tried to say to your friends I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nRely judging what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling by\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these Monday examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the citizens assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting\nAside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with the second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first\nStep and I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge family on the hill battle is to try to convince people and that entrenched powers to um\nI'm not going to be easy to political changes ... seats\nAre especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city start liberal who said yeah I Want to own a unified on to try something new I think our systems burgers\nAnd noticed a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas about hacking the law [noise]\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do [noise]\nI did study law because of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is\nThis is ... he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher you're getting ... us who has this book between facts and norms and he says democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world do we want to build together\nWhat do we are one another where do we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as the kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts and norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge gap oftentimes people who need those rules the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both [noise]\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law [noise]\nTo the people\nHere seem like Mario on the\nHead stage [noise] I Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none the rubbish from a community of hurts people included out on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company goes to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia is got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company has violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears really says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nHas appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\nHe said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing them to decided to use the last means of protest he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory with a bucket of petrol in his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide for billions\nBut we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra Leone in Cambodia in Ethiopia farmers are being cajoled into putting their stumped prints on fifty year lease agreements sending away all the land they've ever known for a paper without anybody even explaining the terms\nRight now\nIn the United states in India in Slovenia people like Rob the are raising their children in the shadow of factories are mines that of poisoning their air and their water",
