responsible drinking and from the any each Casey foundation\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and\nEasy to create humans you are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the yoga I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could aware [noise] we have\nLong lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones were leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to paint or or give us a higher accuse you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that the technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably there's a great example\nOne to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variants enter their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes CCF five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about the technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this\nVery radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with\nHigher IQ or being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where\nThings really take off [noise]\n\n... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control an illusion you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n\nOn today's show we're asking a very important question is who are we [noise]\nOkay do you have the answer deem know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] back a year I have a a a an inkling of who we are\nPsychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\n[noise] so what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell if there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nThat he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and other mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to\nGet us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands\nOf years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker on the stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian who they are taking you gossip man has no instincts and the anthropologist fast we want to give\nThe human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J goals\nWithout ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial foremost is that if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the flight then some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political sphere of human nature is that\nIf we were blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts and perhaps some of them can damage to selfishness prejudice and violence\nFirst of all there a number of reasons to outfit human mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and how it doesn't all come from the outside oh and anyone who uh\nHas both a child and a house that has certainly noticed that the child exposed deceitful acquire a human language whereas the house well presumably because of some innate difference between them and anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not indistinguishable [noise]\nSo for years the\nDebate about nature versus nurture has been just that that debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that\nWho we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nIt's a mistake to think that uh if there is in effect of the environment that shows that were Blake's weights or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are a robots and we're programmed to a or walk into walls\nOn Rhode

[noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing\nWe exist [noise] an al ... explains more from the pet stage [noise]\nWatching this question is so important because consciousness for each of us as ... without fifth that's ...\nThat's myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or pain and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious she did they say have a sense of self and ask them teachers get faster and smarter maybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my I find develops a sense of it saying existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I pretty much\nIn the store I'm going to tell you a conscious experiences of the world around us and about sounds within it\nAll kinds of controlled for at least a nation that happened with free and the cost of living ... [noise]\nI Love this idea of a controlled ... nation is is that is that what we experience is that how we experience the world that it's\nIt's a control to loose nation we are just essentially hallucinating all the time\nI Love the strike zone I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because\nIt points out that everything that we see consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now is a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us through the windows of our eyes scanned\nWhat conscious perception is is basically just in somebody's sitting inside us go looking out there and they see a red table they see a passing\nA law gainers fatter writers have\nReal reality [noise]\n\nThat's right but the truth is that both perceptions are acts of interpretation that acts of informed\nGuesswork that the brain applies when encounters sensory data I think the ... the way I Can't think of it is that there is no light in the skull and as nice sounds that\nOil is going on in the brain\nOr electrical impulses whizzing around and complex passing an out of all the oldest person making the and the Brian ... at it [noise]\nAnd in some sense we we've known this for a long time say since meats and it's been pretty clear that colors red yellow green color is no object to properties of objects in the world they are attributes\nOf of reflected light and and the brain the visual system will make inferences based on wavelengths of light and about what\nOr something it's a ... something as basic as color is not something that we just passively receive from the world we activity attribute it to things out there on the world and the idea of control to the nation is is just that well this applies to everything and this applies to everything that we perceive\nAnd not just perceptions of things out there in the world but also it applies to our perceptions about self\nSense of agency about sensitive volition that every\nThing that we see is a construction but it's it's not a random construction its construction as a best guess that is reined in by the sensory ... times which is why most of us agree when we look at a table that we will say yeah I see it said well you see a table and we both see the same thing\nAnd that's because you don't just random constructions that constrained by the sensory data that we get and that's why I think that's an control of the nation is very appropriate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Providence", "day": "07"}
