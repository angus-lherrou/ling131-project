and on the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can make uncomfortable things a little easier to deal with\nI don't like doing radio ever unless I'm totally in control really because I have a face for TV not right now that is true this is ... she's a stand up comedian and I'm slurry and ever and things on drunk [laughter]\nNo the reason why may soon as a little self conscious about doing radio is because of a disability she has which in her stand up routine she tackles head on here she is on the stage\nAs many tunes diet and I am not drunk but they haven't delivered me what he called my mom thinks they're fun time in six different direction suffocating for loan me in the process as a result I have cerebral\nPalsy which means I shake all the time look\nIt's exhausting I'm like secure secure meets Mohammed Ali [noise]\n\nHe's he is not and genetic it's not a birth defect you can't catch it no one's a curse on my mother's ... and I didn't get it because my parents were first cousins which they are [noise]\n\nOnly happens from opposite ends like what happened\nI must warrant it I'm not inspirational [noise]\nI don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me because at some point in your life you have dreamt that being disabled come on a journey with me it's Christmas Eve\nThere at the mall you're driving around in circles looking for parking\nAnd what do you say [noise] sixteen and the handicapped face and [noise]\nAnd you're like God can I just feel little disabled [noise]\n\nAlso I got to tell you I got Ninety nine problems on hold Li is just one [noise] if if there was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and you saw it live on the phone call so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially\nI Do naturally because men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was doing New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time\nAnd I didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong\nFunny ... way people are able to move on with me\n[noise] yeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because I mean disability\nHas been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television this millions made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed am talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe and can't my father's monitor what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters we're mopping I was mopping if my three older sisters went to public school my parents were sued the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me [noise] my inner river was very strong and\nBy [noise]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times [noise]\nWhen you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk at five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school and um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk\nAnd I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\n[noise] what did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in\nLife was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach\nAnd she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his daring [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or the challenges to humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy in the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happen to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just wanted to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat\nBeyond and people are like talking about guys are talking about several probably you know I don't like but I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to constantly battle\nBut I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now that I Do battle yeah because having grown up with you know one foot in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did that Ted Talk I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front\nOf every one I really thought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing not\nGrowing up there are only six Arabs in my town and they were all my family now there are twenty hours in town and they are still my family [noise] I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian [laughter]\n[noise]\nSupport

about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian and again for ... and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patient [laughter]\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful\nAnd I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes but when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a\nIs a joint um shared experience like a group mind that engaged in\nSo that trip you took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming and not too long after he came up something happened back in New York police were and again it usually felt welcomed them accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system actually offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better Fox but\nAh why not not your own poster campaign right that is nice things about Muslims so my fellow comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work with the MTA for over five months that was approved and then they were supposed to go up\nA V. C. they decided to be the poster citing political content was about a couple of those posters here one I'm a Muslim Muslims [noise]\nLet's say or what they have great recipe\nUs are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying as a couple of dirt comedians took on a major in New York City agency and the comedians one [noise]\n\nWeird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we sent hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nTalk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me about religion we're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all the New Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating already and we lose our salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which holy book stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of raw\nFood her on it is the\nMan\nPeople guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was the violin um came from the Koran Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nMe just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stopped on them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you\nA lot of the three of them do you never know [noise]\nThe wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely ... and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I stand as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing was performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people chuckling and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shifting perception [noise]\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these [noise] chuckle [noise]\nComedian again fireside she's the author of how to make white people laugh\nAnd she also hosts a podcast called the nation you can find her full talk at ... dot com [noise]\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can cope with things that on their face\nAre very funny as this is this is Lisa\nThis is Kevin real as it gets it the writer and they stand up comedian\nLosers these [noise]\nThese as we resist but she does Lang says she's ready for it though [noise]\nOut of it was marketed as [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is what Kevin does for a living but being funny is also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person\nWhen I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and stories\nThat might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his\nDepression but at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in\nWaves and you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark hopeless place\nBut\nI didn't want people to see that and I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin ... tells a story on the head stage and you can already tell this story is gonna sound pretty different from the other ones you've heard on the show\nFor a long time in my life [noise] I felt like I've been living two different lives", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Providence",
