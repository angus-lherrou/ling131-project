C. several years ago I saw you at an event and I said hey you wrote the article and I have this new best friend in Florida that is fighting this with\nAnd and yeah it was I'm actually an event that there's a Courier Journal sponsored yeah and I remember you came up to me and I had this moment of\nWow this is awesome to know that I collected these people [noise]\nI'm headed over to the photo department to see if the photo editors there to assign someone to go meet one might be a little late and I might have to get some more oh oh no she said [noise]\nThe other side of the newsroom hello this is going to look\nHow's it going to read um I Know this isn't that great notice but I'm working on an investigation into an electrical doctor and\nWilling to talk with us tomorrow at one and Jefferson so is that doable\nLet me look at the schedule I probably do okay I just put a new Simon and be there\nOkay sure ... one o'clock Jefferson fill in the bunch ticket and thank you Mary\nBeth\nLet me say say off to me thank you for letting this\nTime [noise] so what's your dog's name but but but\nYou know house it separates\nYou don't think that you know something like this go ahead to you know it's it's been two years this coming week and like my husband right over there just about welfare he was white and pulled him out over here do CPR and so that's why I chose to have you know I could sit in the spring of the day or the night or what ever be in it and just\nContinually see it the way it was you know it's too hard\nAs hell after your husband died um you felt you found an appointment card and you decided to call the doctor's office\nYes I call it he had an appointment therefore September eighth and he died on the satellites and I called them all the aid and I\nTold them pretty much what I said was this is Lee ... both hands why and he will not be able to make it for his appointment today because he's dead he died last night at twenty two Seventeen pm why were you might have to make that call because of blame\nThe doctor or his death I really do because I feel like he's like a big contributing factor in it\nIf he wasn't on the medications he should not have been on I feel like he was there'll be here if he had had the proper treatment he should have had all along what I Would like to see happen to him as he's thrown in a house and the key throughout the why are they can never find it because I'm not as for giving us most people\nYou know they tell you you believe in God and you're supposed to forgive people and all this sort of thing and now I'm just not that way I feel like if you have done harm to people then you should pay the price\nOh\nI'm I'm only ... and\nI'm from level but I'm In Lawrence for Kentucky today for an event held by parents of addicted loved ones are having music speakers and a candlelight vigil\nI was asked today to talk about\nThe issue and the loss of my son\nIs pretty difficult on to our struggle each and every time I'm\nBefore that I never spoke to in front of a group or anything like that\nAnd it's been very hard for me [noise]\n\nShe was in Washington DC every chance\nI have a fulltime regular job that I get paid for and that's just my volunteer job and I'm probably forty fifty hours a week on top of my full time job yeah I Can't seem to stop I we've got to make this right in the wall and [noise]\nWhen you leave your hair what\nYou know they want us to talk about the\nOf your life and we've had five\nYou will have strong and times\nHome and abroad [noise]\n\nMy name is Wesley Duke and I am a assistant director of the Medicaid fraud control unit at the Kentucky attorney general's office\nOn the Emily Walden pleasure to finally be yeah Julie Andrews of of I've heard that story and a bridge Ari we'll a little background we have like the old they're currently\nRight now seven lawsuits filed against various opioid manufacturers and distributors we've alleged well first of all violations of the Kentucky Medicaid fraught statutes\nThat they have a cause for audio claims to be made to the Kentucky Medicaid program we've also alleged violations or the consumer protection act because they made representations through the public to physicians that these things these drugs are safe\nAnd let me clarify that I'm not going after that because my son died if that dropped on going after that because after the research I did and what I found out about\nIs the reason that I have pursued that he should have never had access to it many many other people should not have\nThis was a systemic issue you know all the way from the manufacturer all the way to the positions\nDown the line there were problems\nWe're seeking financial day which was so this is this is a case about money and you know and of course they'll never be enough money to fix all the damage that was ... you know that's just a factor so I and as far as far as the number I I I I don't feel real comfortable talking about that today at this time to do all this but we're talking a significant sum of\nMoney that will go to address the problem\nWell what's interesting as some of these drug companies are trying to get these cases all news to federal court yes because\nI think they believe that they possibly could settle for less money\nTo the cases we've discussed today or civil actions not criminal you would have to prove your criminal liability and you'd have to know that the executives were aware\nThat possibly could exist but uh as far as these cases here today or civil you know and um and I don't want to say that there could not be criminal liability because it could potentially exists but we've not gotten therefore you here\nThey do need to go to present I Would like to see the federal department of justice filed criminal charges against these companies and times back it up for what they have John\n[noise]\nThings are moving forward and I'm very pleased about that I I Do think started dragging that it'll take some time and and I'm okay with that let's get it right\nI'm heading to Washington D. C. and a march to the White House Seventy two thousand people died last year we need to step it up the federal government must be involved in that\n\nNot just a mom I Want to say I want people to stop dying\nIt took weeks to come into records and checking dump sources for my story on the allegations against Dr Peter Steiner ran under a headline that start to the\nEye when the doctor for his dad\nSome died others fear for their life under ... physicians care\nPharmacists chat\nFacts leaned in and locked eyes with the drive to a customer before delivering a stark warning if you take this it will kill you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In the Studio", "city": "Providence", "day": "31"}
