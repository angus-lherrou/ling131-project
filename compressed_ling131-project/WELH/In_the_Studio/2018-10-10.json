{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "Rally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically to the entire year of the game developed so it's sort of like having a first draft of a novel we've got all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better started to it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is and now it's just about making it better\nAnd I certainly will be a story that the timescale of yeah that's right so each game is a a month that's sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back\nAnd knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the games kind of reinforce and ending [noise] semi this whole with tens of thousands of people in it will qualities and some railway quilt again what happens tonight\nTonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to be meeting up with some place that you're in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing three seasons three and I'll be watching it with no fat in hand\nReally seeing how the out of the box experience where how their first games were [noise]\nAnd I'll be doing that for about twelve hours over the weekend I'm\nAt night it's going to be too ... game I'll be recruited them off the Internet using Twitter as people I Do not know I've never met you get a lot of submissions were very fortunate in that regard\nSo you're kind of feel like an old high on you know I don't know how much what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible in front of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nBut I get ... rich state of being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nAnd try not to interfere as much as possible\nThere's only a scientific discipline that you go back to the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer that question unless they get really soccer I don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world W I came all bullshit code is only a little late to like to see the ... pandemic [noise]\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules and then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precise or you're trying to write a rule book as full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time one of the things that helps us as\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send a doctor translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English schools and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nLanguage is from other countries filtering by concealed game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be well they all affected in some way I mean you're like in Germany you can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon put that on the cover you just won't sell it and Germany so it you think of the culture you have to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo we kind of postal German ... games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games like that [noise] it fit into\nWhat were called German games in the nineties and then Europe games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of aversion to direct conflict\nThey had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively got in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first like technically haven't taken anything from you know I just prevented you from getting some things which on the surface\nIs is the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the east coast more aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred ... developed a\nGeneral policy selling games about everything you can imagine titles about SPN oh ... ... ... creations of supernatural steam punk and it is tempting to think in a world of PlayStation ... acts

Silicon Valley Nineteen Ninety seven I got a job at a cleric corporation started apple so it's like this exciting sexy job as they happen to leave the Midwest and and make my way out to California\nI think they're all four months before I got laid off and really got it got a sense of what was your lifestyle as it turned out not much security yeah exactly there's a lot of turnover but you just kinda got adept at at switching jobs and you have to maintain a big network of people and it was really exciting\nAnd the right in saying that you were working on what was called the personalization of the ...\nWhen I was working we're just starting to view what was social networking those apps are just kind of coming out of the scene that was working on Yahoo and it was the lead interaction designer\nNow you'd call social networking applications for something that no it was really defining tech coach or you were kind of stuff\nYeah I mean back when I was working on this that people didn't want to put their photo op on line 'cause I thought that was being few public a set that we take for granted\nNow or was it was really on the edge when I was working on it and we're just beginning to understand what they like to like make enough gate that you'd share with people and now you know it's ubiquitous you see it on Twitter is you know basically ... everywhere\nBut it back in time we were just kind of learning with us interaction patterns were so I was hoping to document those who share those naturalized us across Yasser such a Frisbee defining still for coach now isn't it yeah I mean it's like I said if you figure if you see it everywhere I mean people are chicken and I found hundreds of times a day\nWhich really struck me the the two days is that you know work in an ... on a low failed he's kind of on plugged from something that society is awash with now social media because about face to face contact\nYeah it's one thing I'd really like about tabletop gaming it's very different from a electronic and making that you you're playing with people across the table here making eye contact it's like this medium for connecting across your dining room table because people an excuse to to be with each other and that that's one thing I really love\nThe importance of this time away from screens that games while you'll allow\nBiting their devices that really isolating you know you're not on your eye patter your honor X. box or whatever that they say forget to connect with people in those games off of this great way especially popular game to operate right way to\nReally communicate with people and connect reconnect [noise]\nYou're listening to in the studio a from the BBC Wilson if I'm Kevin cool and I mean Indianapolis in the United states I jammed

might have a great idea at this time but maybe next trying Greg has this amazing idea this plant cell funding able to work together and kind of play off of each other\nIt is this wonderful game there were already familiar with but then a layered on top of that is is uh is is intriguing story that unfolds as you play a twist you know twist your approach and you have to constantly be adapting\nWell good luck good loved ones that are funny I'm semi way in the middle\nIt's going really well they just finished up the prologue game\nGone through all the rules they won the prologue you already
