winners of the Julia Child a war and when we last left her her when they were telling us about the first years of their seminal LA restaurant city cafe\nFor the French food which we in the parking lot because they didn't have such a big enough [noise] and then how they got as we figured as nice fight for Susan would take a trip and it would change both they're [noise]\nThey're going back to tape up security [noise]\nAfter about two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages and Susan I'm decided that she can take a trip and go to India and uh I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a little kind of like a fake\nFight or a race thing we were racing to see who could bona lego land quicker and that's how it's worked out like yeah I think I Want and\nShe didn't win because well I like through my arm up in the air as in a gesture and she had a knife in the air and I cut the tendon in my finger so I had to go to the hospital and get a cast and she was like oh maybe I Can't go and I said no no you got to go you got to go\nAnd so then there was me Jose Luis and we're talking every thing's for those two weeks ago she was gone\nBut what happened is when she came home\nShe was gone how to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did the core as like little ... freighters we did a puente a pancake we made doll and curry and get a shot navy and\nWe we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian\nThings so that and and I had been so inspired over there by\nAll the flavor profiles and just that it was such an interesting 'cause he's all vegetarian but it was the place where I I was staying on an Asher more a friend of mine lab so I spent the whole time in the kitchen with\nHis cooks and all the women were you know not allowed in the main little kitchen they basically we're just three holes in a cement block that you know you put a fire underneath that by all the women were out on the porch grinding spices making all the different breads and it was so\nInspiring that it just was something I felt like we have to put these things on the menu and then about a year later Mary Sue took her first trap she didn't cut me right before she laugh\n[laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand and had a very similar\nExperience yeah my uncle was there and he I landed up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and it was had a big very very authentic type of fate and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten years before that\nAnd she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any time but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad anti red curry duck and I'm scallops and oh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing\nAnd so then you know that our menu them became had cats to lay and then duck red curry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then you know put those are and so it was a very mixed like\nThat and one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened and I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah and then I you know we were we this is how Susan and I kind of worked together we're in the kitchen going oh you remember those chicken breast we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let them go another day okay well let's just\nLet's make a sausage outta that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then I don't know what do you think oh let's just try with cream and parmesan anyway that rigatoni became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all of them [laughter]\nAnd literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other inspiration comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement bananas\nOr you see something in the market I mean when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around in a little tiny VW Bug and we\nYou know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could do find\nIt but if we'd go to the market and see something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how to use it with this chili that I remember we discovered ... chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what a Tripoli was more or less a chain of restaurants that it was Nineteen eighty five yeah\nYeah I mean we didn't you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay well our little kitchenette city cafe was myself and Mary Sue and a and a dishwasher\nBut then eventually we hired like a ... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that no no no we'll hire you for like five dollars an hour or whatever it was a fantastic whatever minimum wage yeah and it said okay\nWe loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents\nIn their home and his mom took us\nEvery day for a few days to the market this is our first chip and we'd like bought everything that we didn't know what it was and come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about Mexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around where we just like\nAte everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu\nAnd literally we had to take our notebook out like with the pa new Joe's or with the ... deep desert couldn't remember what they even were you know called and so we were constantly looking at our notebook but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nAgain I keep thinking about the timeframe or this was in the early to mid eighties this was not stuff that was happening and shut the restaurants and\nYou know people starting today have such a different frame of reference from a and I think ... maybe they're probably grew up with you know their favorite Thai restaurant but they went through your with their family and their favorite Mexican place so they went to an office all the stuff was built into so many American policies are growing up though\nRight you know when we opened city so the bigger version when we open city restaurant and it was in food that was influence from cities all around the world ... we put at ton Nouri oven in\nAnd we got that ... or even from a owner of a Indian a hotel he was an Indian man we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire tend to hurry up and so it's just rock clay that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair\nAnd we brought it back in the back of a pickup truck hoping we wouldn't hit too big a bump so that it would crack and then we learned all about how to fire it and then we spent one day like fourteen hours where you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our arm in there because you had to keep\nRushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard while in order to glaze it and we played Indian music and incense and then finally you know the night before are opening party and Ruth Rachel was there that night and walls\nWe may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of non ... and you can't even looked like a dirty side of any kind of out of the oven [laughter] well\nInterestingly you talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right and we didn't know what that meant you know an opening it was just completely seat of the pants\nAnd we were dead out of money we had to open because we needed some cash we couldn't even buy groceries so we had been in the kitchen with our health department or the okay for about maybe forty eight hours when we open the doors and we were flooded with you [laughter]\nAnd we were the only two people who knew how to cook the food\nAnd that very first night our hut you know we had to go through all getting the approval of the ... or you haven't because no one even know how to give it approval we finally get it approved so\nWe open the door and the hood went out that first night and so we it was crazy hot on the line I almost passed out and we were jammed in right very true and I were the only two that were like running from station to station and\nHappy we know now what we know because you know that that opening was pretty brutal but you know I think also what's different is we were too young women and I think subconsciously we felt like\nServing Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts this is the public's radio eighty nine point three of them [noise] funding comes from listeners like Peter

that is you get to go to all the winners of Julia Child award and bring back something from them to display in the museum so I wouldn't know what\nWhat's that like I mean what's it like standing in front of someone who's going through stuff and you know they're thinking\nAbout ... I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\nFor a ... [laughter]\nYeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that\nIt has been different for each of the winners to tell you the truth and um\nYou know for ... and it was something that we talked about and then it led from one thing to another um for Rick Bayliss it was also very different I was able to speak with him and his staff and to really talk about it quite a lot of time\nAnd by the time they came back with a very wonderful list\nI pretty much knew that there were certain things that uh stood out to um ... donated a collection of menus and as you probably know he has an artist and these menu or works of art and\nShow both of course the menu items but also he is when the city as well as photographs and documents and a few kitchen tools\nFrom Rick bail us uh we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico in the Nineteen seventies they are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist of keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico and\nThe field notes are handwritten and then midway through they are typed\nAnd he realized that he really wanted to type is notes halfway through the trips we bought a little typewriter and he donated the typewriter as well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance dividing Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see we're really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories [noise]\nUm this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with\nMary Sue militant and Susan senator about their you know their stuff but we don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and um how they got to where they are how they got into\nThe restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what were the challenges\nAnd how did they land on you know this very successful formula that they have so for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big themes might be in their in their histories\nAnd then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the\nKind of the the kernel of of their their own history [noise]\nUm so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill\nOut just boxes and bags and piles of things and you know to a curator that's just you know that's catnip for like ... and I'm looking at that and they had a pretty good sense of you know what we were after and had come up with some great material\nSo what is it what is it their donors your news from which\nIs yeah [laughter] okay that's where we watching 'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes arrived a few weeks ago and in one box was Mary Sue ... nice bag um that she hacked\nFor competing on top chef masters when she did and twenty eleven\nAnd you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collections yet and they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged there are six nights forced bachelors your chopsticks scissors Lester is all this stuff for a very very cool\nAnd what about Susan Susan today\nYes well the two of them of also donated some of the dishes from their early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and these are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful\nAnd they are um shapes that reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe and uh so we have um a nice iced eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm and to come to the museum we will have a chef's coat um you know Mary Sue ensues and\nWe're very into color very early on and so we have a pink chefs coat I'm with border grill embroidered on the cough I'm\nWhich again shows how they're very cognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle on which is is wonderful [noise]\nUm and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then their paper and\nFor us there were these little notebooks that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up and you look at that and then you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the corner roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants self little no books like that\nNeither one from India and for Thailand cool and you know this is where you can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and and to then think about bringing that back for their restaurants in Los Angeles\nYeah it's so cool to because I imagine you know [laughter] so I was Twenty years and years you know Thirty years and you know the people were going to win it then you're going to be like hey can you tell me the text text me at all [laughter]\nAnd you're in a row of torture [laughter] but let me out here we\nAre also doing though is you're going through essentially somewhat which as you said someone's life story through the object what they've held and written in isn't an emotional process for them\nIs kind of um and in fact you will see people bring that stuff out and then it's there and then when we come and we start handling it gently of course but handling it in and talking to them about it\nYou know the the stories are triggered and when they start telling the story the meaning is made a parent of what this object represents to them and their and their lives\nAre these emotional moments when somebody will you know have that look on their face\nAnd we always tell people look you know it's your choice to donate something to the collection and if you're not ready to you're not ready I'm so we don't force people but um but those emotional stories are the things that we document along with collecting the actual objects\nAnd that we try to preserve as well so that it can be conveyed and communicated to a larger audience yeah", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "20"}
