against financial loss more progressive commercial Geico\nWheeler sweet shows\nI'm really a pastry chef with Boston cream pie with America's Test kitchen [noise] we've got an incredible story about a pilgrimage in India to cook for a goddess and we'll hear about an iconic writer who mused on both feasting and fast and let's get to desert first\n[noise]\nWhen I was in ... school Fifteen Years ago I knew a woman named stellar choose a pastry chef in the making and\nReally didn't know each other that well but she was smart and thoughtful and at some point [noise] I went through a really rough patch where I really needed a friend and she was there and she showed me and fruit kindness [noise] well\nShe graduated not long after and we fell out of touch with eight years later we found each other on the Internet\nYou can come from chef but even more should be done writing\nQuirky terrific blog\nAnd eventually got more and more into writing about science in history of desserts getting inspired\nBy how classic cookies and take some pies and putting were made in the past\nAnd then re imagined those recipes for the president [noise]\nAnd just a few months ago I was so thrilled to see her first cookbook rave tart debut on the New York times so\nIt's a hostile thanks so much for joining us examined me [noise]\nSo I Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's a comic American desserts so what makes a desert\nIconic American\nI really wanted the book to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realize pretty quickly that you know outside of the south not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie\nAnd and so that's not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know born and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that so I didn't want to be a collection of\nRegional desserts desserts that are important to some people but not others I wanted to be this celebration of all the desserts that connect us together coast to coast\n... so how did you decide which what qualified maybe it's kind of like that um classic a quota about porn you'll you'll\nKnow when you see it but you cannot have this instinct right like I mean something like yellow cake Betty Crocker and Duncan Heinz have ensure that yellow cake is something that all Americans had a chance to try and love and we all know white cake is we all know chocolate chip cookies are and so on a certain level smut it's instinctual but then there's other ones that\nLoom a little bit larger due to pop culture or something like ... pie and so that was kind of a at least a starting point for determining what it was in some of it was a little bit crowd sourced on Twitter and just asking people like\nHow did your mom make whatever how does your dad made whatever and then when there'd be a good response and a lot of feedback people talking about their memories about these desserts that I'd I'd know for sure that was a good one and if\nWomen starting a few days ahead of time who are all going to this place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride\nAnd and the women are taking with them a single bag usually\nThey have a bad that is filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ... and the entire ceremony revolves around or adding to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up\nAnd what they're setting up our a makeshift horse of three bricks\nA clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and they set up all over the city so they're you know how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow yes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like\nAnd this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million wow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple that's devoted to a goddess yeah that's the way that they refer\nTo her is actually called my mom um she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of this at this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as Patrick Holly and um she's worshipped locally by these women and she's seen as sort of a uh getting figure but also a very intense strong and some times furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift hearth with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so\nThe morning that this happens and women wake up very early ah they wake up to prepare\nThemselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice and they dress often and new clothing I was told that women are off\nAnd then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the ... for the ... and and sometimes the pots and they they wait until the signal from the temple comes in a signal is that um the priest and the temple lights a fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then they're also volunteers running around and helping to light heart so all at once at the same exact moments all around the city there are speakers set out\nWomen light a fire and they all start cooking so was actually really incredible about this is the smell you're you're walking around the city all of us smoke is all over the place and everything smells like burnt rice and fire and coconut bark\nAnd these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes and they're all praying they're all looking at their pots looking at the sky all in the same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise]\n[noise] and they're really cooking so tell us that it's a rice porridge yes so they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water they wait for the water to boil\nAnd then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn rice or read rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a ... hue and they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handfuls\nAnd then they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony at the pot must boil over to satisfy that got us so when you look around all of these pots are bubbling over this sort of steamy was beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they do so they they spend time cooking it so that the rice gets soft like any rice dish would and then at the end\nAnd they add all of these seasonings and sweet flavors and it depends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to ... because he is a a purifying a sort of symbol um many women at gender there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which is an honor find palm sugar and uh at the end they they cover their pots once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf and they wait for a priest to come around this can take hours instead of in the interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they rub each other's shoulders a nap\nAnd then when the priest comes they all get behind\nTheir hearts again they take off the banana leaf and the priest comes in scattered holy water over there they're pots and then they're free to you and this moment it's so beautiful because it's the thing that have been waiting for all year this is a sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take a spoonful they taste each other's pong dollar they feed each other and then they put the banana leave back over top they packed the pots away and they leave\n[noise] the fleet such a beautiful story thank you for coming in I think he's highly [noise]\n\n\n\nWe've we've

new biography of re fasting and feasting tells her complicated life story in our contributor Ross Parsons part of it in Los Angeles [noise]\nAt um betterment welcomed the splendid table\nIt's a pleasure to be here out of your book describes patience gray is the most important food writer would never read as she was a fascinating person who loved this very multifaceted life um who watch what kind of person where she\nYeah I suppose there's something a bit counterintuitive about making the claim that an author most people have never heard of as one of the most important food writers at the last half century uh there were many incarnations of patients\nGray she was born in West sorry in the south of England\nGrew up mostly in the country although she went to to queens college in London and then the London School of economics\nAt a remarkable experience during the war raising two children out of wedlock and lived in a tiny cottage owned by her mother\nOr through to the Nineteen fifties when she returned to London and\nTook up a career as a translator editor and writer eventually publishing her first cookbook plot to Jordan Nineteen fifty seven and then in fact went on to be this the first woman's editor of the observer which was\nQuite possibly the most important newspaper in London at that time and the ... all of this preceded or Mediterranean odyssey which is really what she is she's known for everyone who knows\nPatients gray nose or through honey from a weed\nSo they think of a this woman who live this\nVery intrepid a rugged life in Greece and Italy and then finally in poorly as if it's a very south of of Italy and this is a unquestionably one of the most fascinating chapters of her life but it it's by no means the whole person\nBut patients and from a weed occupy the sort of unusual place in the world food writing\nThe book is is considered to be one of the best books on food ever written and yet patients remains almost completely unknown or patients with a contemporary of Elizabeth David ... another British food writer and M. F. K. Fisher who have far greater notoriety or than patients does and\nPatients wrote about\nA food and uh ideas into food that that have really become mainstream today so in some ways that's surprising that she hasn't better known you know I I still encounter people today who say that honey from a weed or changed their life and and you know that's something you don't often hear about a cookbook yeah\nAppearances first cookbook ... it was published in the Nineteen fifties it was extremely influential in England uh what was it like and how to set the table for her future work\n... was a remarkable book and as you say it was a a run away a best seller published in Nineteen fifty seven\nAnd one of the first mass market paperbacks of its kind penguin\nUp until that point I hadn't done a lot of of cookbooks at all or let alone cookbooks aimed at a um a mass market audience\nAnd the book covered a wide range of European cuisine and it was mostly based on the country that patients on her coauthor promotes boy had traveled to before the war ended in body the same kind of\nRomance and a sort of wander less that many of the books that Elizabeth David ... had written earlier in the decade I'm also did\nIt's a dinner party ... let's put it that way honey from a weed is completely different it's a really it'd be a sin credit book it's\nAnd leader more for your sweet tooth the

taking your calls question for me or just feel like talking food pick up your phone one eight hundred might be sending five to five to [noise]\nAnd we have Fernando from plant cute like when\nI went on our you very well may call your friend says please do thank you for the call\nYour voice is such a familiar and pleasant want it permeates our entire house as we have speakers and all the rooms and we've we've listened to you so much and so so often that uh you're like my brother you've been you've been here at home\nWith us in Ecuador [laughter] well thank you I Hope to actually come to Ecuador one day 'cause it's a it's credibly beautiful but uh what are we talking about\nWell here's the problem by uh we live\nIn a very hot place\nOr do we get a real like a nor'easter is like eighty five degrees and that's what we put on a sweater\nOr it it's it's very hot and very humid all the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt not not so much because salt nature preservation but just to get the dry and a ... and so we really\nAre are very careful with a you know how we store things\nAnd one day we were having a party and a friend came that friend have just come from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of ... was just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we called it ... around him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do with this enormous chunk\nAnd so in the midst of the party at my wife says why should we cut the what we are sitting on I just put it in the freezer for now and she put it in the freezer and it's been there and ah anyway we have no idea what to do once we ... because we cannot possibly\nThree pounds or ... before it would spoil and I am totally committed\nTo your to your suggestions because this morning knowing out speaking to my ... pulled it out of out of the ... is currently defrosting refrigerator\n[laughter] oh wow so you're saying there's no turning back yeah there isn't it [laughter]\nYou've got you've got the guardian not on the frozen judo I see this\nIs an interesting problem I Am honored than you would trust me with it I Hope I don't feel you I have to say I never actually had to deal too much with a giant fruit and block\nBefore that's a that's being in a in a in some ways a blessing problem\nNow have to tell you given the fact that he was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to defrost meaning if one of my questions to\nYeah you know if you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in an industrial freezer that can work because it freezes it so quickly that the ice crystals\nUm stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're then they're in the home freezer because it takes a while the ice crystals start to grow and they and they started to poke through the cell walls and so you may find that elite some juice\nAnd you may find that the texture when you when you bring it out is not going to be acquaintance um for more you know sort of to them as it was before and maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally do frosted what I might think about doing is\nIf you have a a deli or if you haven't done we slice yourself or if you know a deli nearby minimum consider running over there and having them slice it thin while it's still a partially frozen\nSo you ... slicing thin\nThe time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can rephrase it not too much damage that said the only thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful textures when it was you know originally a fresh per se um but so I think about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably once it was to ... even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think to use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around his piece of chicken you wrapping it around and the and then you can sort of cigarettes you it becomes a layer of flavor [noise]\nUm [noise] you can cut it into chunks and use it to just do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a salty cured ham if you're if you're not in position to be able to enjoy it and it's sort of like\nSilky thin sliced a state [noise]\nNo I assumed that since sliced of phase of it slices over that it would be something\n[laughter] I Wonder if even if we\nEven thought maybe it was just putting the whole thing in the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole ...\nYou know I have never done that but I is that thing right where like freedoms another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] [laughter] so hey\nShy and I'm sure someone in Italy with like you know rolling their grave when they heard someone done this to appreciate but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause all the flavor is still there for sure the texture of all the flavor on a beautiful cures labor is going to be there so if you do that and the slow cooker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious\nUm it'll be white salty so of course you you want to think about that when eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish 'em that of cooking the whole thing but you know in the in the American south they had these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIts cured it aired dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slice it indeed thin you took the whole I Am and you would boil the whole ham and much the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid I'm so used to I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze not and use that as a stock or as a a a flavor base rather stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it or you know as a flavor an answer for you know vegetable dishes maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a fish called ... and one of the things it's like a big giant stew and one of the things they should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bacon square into which at them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so I kinda like that idea of mine yeah different things that you're cutting it in half\nAnd using some of it for chunks for adding to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah or if you cut it up nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render its fat and maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other fats in the pan when they get a little bit nice and brown scrambled eggs in that and that would be\nSo delicious yeah I don't you know I Would like use the ... to do with something that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean\nThanks so much for listening all the way from ... new\nBook thanks so much for the Atlanta put actually we have enough to put into practice [laughter] let us know goes sure well thank you so much do you\nThink you take care [noise] All right we have
