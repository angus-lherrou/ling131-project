about paying attention and getting close to the earth and it inspired Alice Waters you know the queen of eating local who actually wants told me that she didn't really know that America had a good thing to be out of\nUntil she read and they'll do so much Lewis help change the image of southern food helped launch the farm to table movement and she did it by writing about a tiny place in central

came out in the senior as ... like Alex Haley and while that book was making America look at the pain of slavery ms Lewis was writing said\nWe made for ourselves [noise]\nMs Lewis died in two thousand six but her life and her work still inspired us to dedicate this hour to her talking to people who are inspired by her people put with her people who live with her and loose with the chefs an author\nA farmer and activists first we'll start just with her as a person\nFor that we are joined by her knees Nina Williams the bank\nHany that's great to have you [noise]\nThe mourning fans it's how are you this is this is fantastic\n[laughter] well thank you and I am so happy to get to talk with you about your hands you know she uses legendary figure for so many of us and the food world but how do you remember her as your off what do you think of when you think of her\n[laughter] oh bless remembers spending a lot of time with an ad in a shared my mother's oldest sister\nA she was funny I had my mom together always laughing and joking about something\nSo I Am really interested\nIn how you got interested in the work of and the Lewis I think we're both in the same boat that we never knew her personally we never met her I was right but are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through a magazine in two thousand eat when the editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south\nAnd they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by the Senate Louis called what a southern and in this essay on this list positioned the culture of the American south and the culture of the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside music\nAnd literature and painting and other forms of art ... and for me it was this incredibly\nStriking moment as someone who was interested in food in and really desperately wanted to get involved in working food was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that now Lewis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nOn but I I had no idea she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and sell in love with her\nAnd it was many years later that I was working with a notice is editor Judith Jones who in the editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on caught in Rhode Island and yes the diary of Anne Frank famous legends yeah but I'm leaving and really sort of the canon of American cookbook author is our English writing I should say ... and she published and Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones enough work\nIt became apparent to me that her book that you did with an S. Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away from working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who is writing very explicitly about American cuisine and culture and very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that starts to attention and pay attention moment in in Judith Jones as career of what it meant and you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going\nMany civil rights Vietnam War it's come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity yeah what it meant to publish a book from the perspective an African American woman about the American south of rural Americans south near the perspective of home cook\nAnd then it just I think for many people who come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of unfortunately direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to Janet down your throat um and you need it to kind of be ready to receive it in her on your own time and I think for a lot of people that's come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by receive it in that when you say that came late\nWell you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it as a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the seasons the work of foraging of working in the fields of putting food out in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history in the American south of of really giving dignity to that poultry as its own entity in a lot of ways that's separate from white American culture\nMhm [noise] so I I wrote a story about to lose a number of years ago and in my research ... called you up and and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I I didn't pick up before mhm\nIncluding but I think this idea of the face of country cooking as being more with political work what you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as\nOr just the sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country but I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds\n... her her grandparents who the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave mhm if they were freed slaves at once that's right and\nI think if you think of that story you'd imagine a store that was one of hardship and you know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it was a life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say hey whatever stereotypes you have of us mhm if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine\nYour started after all that's right and that's a profoundly political thing it's\nA massive corrective I think just so much of what had been written in what continues to be written\nThat the life of the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture of large series of regional cultures that was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these meeting communities that were financially pour their life was rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it um and and things that we think that's sort of still is luxury foods meets cream butter um foraged mushrooms from the forest I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they have created for themselves\n... they're literally making souffle it in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fear ... to it too I think is so again maybe subtle and maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene\nAnd she describes the tradition of you know when you bought the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nJust really incredible image of and they take the bladders out and they blow the butter up like balloons and hide them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later he was like can you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally mhm and\nBut also I remember reading it and the way she describes\nThe hogs after they've been slaughtered ...\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described in the hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man in a nearby community to hers\nWho was lynched\nAfter he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you have this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do and it's all it's real miss\n'em in the reality of it I I Can't help but think that you had those things in her mind certainly I'm On a few wrote them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was so unfair lynching and her ... you know that that there was incredible ... much present to deal with\nWhether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time and and that she was going to see it sort of quietly and many people who knew her in her as being a fairly quiet woman she often didn't say more than need to be sad is that she said nothing at all if she was gonna open her mouth and put pen to paper\nIt was going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from France roots and and then she was just going to sort of play sit there and leave it there and and you can see that\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find out yeah paradox and that and I think ...\nYeah incredible incredible life thank you so much to her and my pleasure France\nSarah Franklin the editor of at the Louis at the table with an American average\nTeacher's food writing at NYU and she's also working on a book on Judith Jones is Lewis is legendary editor\nMm Mm Mm Mm\nMm\n[noise] one of the Lewis is deepest friendships was with another ... Scott pecan they bonded over a commitment to southern food they wrote a cookbook together and for the last years of her life\nLived together [noise] so after talking to lots of people about miss loses reach the world we also wanted to know what it was like to be standing next to her in the kitchen scot free to talk with you a good to talk with you Frances services so fun to get to speak with you because we've been talking\nAbout ms Lewis the all these different angles and all these different directions but I can talk with you about\nCooking with her for what was it like cooking with and the Louis\nOh that's a great question it was um [noise] I mean it was wonderful it was absolutely wonderful and it was\nIt was really\nWas similar but yet only unlike cooking with anyone else [noise] um it could be very chatty and laughter filled with for the most part it was very quiet but it was it was quiet because we were both so focused on what we were doing I think maybe\nHelping businesses

support online prep smart go far and enjoy the ride and the goose dot com slash ACT\n[noise]\nYou know and the Lewis was called the ground I'm southern cooking so many times the words are literally etched into her gravestone so no one disputes that honor but\nIt didn't make us think she grew up with such a particular version of southern cuisine in central Virginia and we wanted to know more about that region so he called on the corner historian Jessica Harris to fill us and [noise] the Jessica it's\nLovely to be back for him\nSo I Want to start actually um by referencing a story which you probably know but there's a story where William Faulkner walked into the restaurant where an Lewis was the chef at the time in New York City caffeine Nicholson and\nI asked her if she had learned to cook in Paris and actually missed hadn't his sister roof told me no she learned to make a souffle from my mother\nSo especially if you missed hadn't his mother right here's this woman who is the daughter of an enslaved men who is making these exquisitely French souffle raise home\nSo it really let me think like can you tell us about the black food a central Virginia back then 'cause that's not I think what a lot of people would have expected\nWell I think there were variety of things to remember I don't necessarily know what this ad ... parents might have done\nBut never forget that African Americans who were in service\nCooked and they cooked not only African American meals but they cook things that were eaten by the families were home they were in or two of them they were in service therefore having a much wider killing our repertoire\nAnd so did that breadth of cooking really mark this region\nOr or get it in a way I mean my mother's people are from Virginia\nI'm not the same part of Virginia I don't believe is miss and I've never really look that up I probably should but one of the things that I Know about my grandmother is\nShe just cooked a wide range of things I mean she was a ... says if they're just such a term you know she could roast anything brilliantly beautifully not what people think of normally she made preserves um when I looked at some of them is ed ... early cookbooks\nThere were things that sounded like my grandmother's food but it also comes out of Virginia's culinary history\nOr with Jefferson being this big Franco file and [noise]\nIs that what you mean what I mean I think that's certainly a part of it but if you think of you know the what are they called him in Virginia the F F will be the first family's a Virginia you\nKnow if you think of all of those folks of that kind of em elation of European of that desire to be Patricia in of all of those kinds of things that were in effect\nIt really would be in effect on both sides of the racial divide Mm Cuba narrowly anyhow\nSo what are some of the differences in the southern food that missing the grew up with and what we I think more stereotypical you think of as being southern food\nWell I think they overlap I think the food they miss it and I grew up with because she lived in an agricultural seasonally inflict the universe\nWas very local very local we talk about the kind of cooking that she did which was very\nFor one of a better term sophisticated\nMhm but I mean sophisticated in its simplicity the sophistication of ms and the food is that it's simple\nAnd simply beautifully done\nIt is about the manner in which you this quote it is about the ingredients in his about all of that mhm now that inflict in various different ways throughout the south\nI'll never forget speaking with Leah Chase in New Orleans\nAnd Mrs chase simply said you know grills or picky about what they put in their pockets [laughter] they are they're very very picky about what goes into the various dishes African Americans have not always had\nThe ability to be as picky picky about what goes into the pots and sometimes\nCooking to the degree that you have a choice to the degree that you have the ability to the degree that you have variations or\nThings that you can grow raise all of that for the best of the best is what you sir\nWhen those things go wrong when those things aren't quite as universal is one my hope\nWhen you get other kinds of food and you go to other kinds of cooking then you get that stuff that I call hardscrabble mhm you know my mother was Virginia My father was a country Georgia\nThat always played out at the dinner table my dad was shuttling man but ... of all of those things my mother was really you know roast pork with crackling and you know stuff like that so you get diverted live\nRight but it's always the best of what you can surf\nSlowly thank you so much for talking with us today Jessica is always a pleasure thank you for having me [noise] that was Jessica the Harris author of many books latest hold my soul looks back\nAnd fun fact about her the national museum of African American history and culture actually called on her\nTo define the different regions of black cooking for there's a restaurant [noise]\nTony ... and Martin is a hero of mine and full disclosure she's an author I work with but before I knew her knew that she was working on a massive project a book called the ... it's a history of African American cooking told through her research to two hundred years of black and\nThey paint this picture of a cuisine that way more diverse and technical and sophisticated than the stereotypes of black fur swing knew she must have a story about this Louis we asked her to join us today he Tony great to have you here have Frances thanks for\nHaving me how old how did you meet as\nWell you know ours was a chance meeting many many years ago when I was a young journalist at the LA Times and I attended a conference that she was at and I'm embarrassed to say that I did not know who she was that\nUm she was surrounded by adoring fans who did know men so I went over to introduce myself to her and find out\nWhat it was that made her so special and it didn't take long for me to figure that out\nWhat about you about her [noise]\nWell you know I have to say that my initial reaction was clearly one of her physical stature\nI'm sort of like going on that first blind date right you have [laughter] traction and you you don't know anything about the person um but she was so incredibly beautiful and statue west and so poised intelligent and\nClear headed and not to say that other African American women aren't that it's just that that's the impression that she leads\nYeah it's amazing 'cause so many who described her as being regal and a half years later ... name was in fact Regina right it's like she was fated to that wow I don't know if I knew that a while\nWell you know we get stuck some times in in making physical observations but I\nHave to say that given the work that I've been doing and how it started in my desire to find an alternative view of African American women in the food world I don't guess that I can escape the fact that what she looked like made a huge impression on me as well\nMost of them in ... character or as being the representation of an African American women in the kitchen\nAnd my goal with my all of my work is to use African American cook as an example of people who have been disparaged and spoken about prejudicial fully\nAnd um they have so much that
