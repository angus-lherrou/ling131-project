guarantee you the hosts goes survey says the board flips acid lights up and you take home fabulous prizes and that's because chefs are always talking about how 'bout splash acidic vinegar is what elevates a dish\nAnd Michael Harlan ... should know he spent his whole career out chefs first as a cook himself and then as a photographer and writer and he's made himself an expert on vinegar as\nHe's traveled the world for them he infuses them and yes he makes them in his apartment or contributor shot a fever talks with Michael about bringing this restaurant secret weapon home\nHi Michael thanks so much for talking with us how you doing thanks for having me see how to tell us how your obsession with the world of vinegar came to that\nI think the same way most people make vinegar the first time a accidentally leaving a bottle of red wine out and open on the table but it kind of snowball into a couple of other alcohol and had a leftover quarter keg that I poured into a barrel and it turned into the ... vinegar I've ever had in my life\nSo definitely a happy accident\nIt it is and now it's absurd obsession [laughter]\nNow your book reveals vinegar to be so much more of are still in the kitchen that we might realize so can you tell us about some of the main functions and cooking and baking\nYeah vinegar as a flavor carrier it's not just this overt thing that kind of\nPunches you in the chest and makes you cough it it is a vehicle for a lot of other flavors to kind of co mingling coalesce so you know when you make of vinegar grad either two two one two or three to one ratio oil the vinegar um you're actually trying to express the nuances in the Roma individually gr by carrying it in that fat\nAnd that kinda carries over and a lot of cooking process these it'd be glazes pans to pick up the fond I'm it stabilizes egg whites and Marines or it is a really interesting part of cooking because as overt as we think it is is that is actually about a balanced harmony and a lot of other cuisines\nAnd of course in baking vinegar it's used in so many old fashioned\nBaking recipes to react with a ... and says well\nOh absolutely that science experiment of baking soda and vinegar you know shooting up like a volcano that certainly is kind of like what Irish ... bread is a you know using that as a full Evan\n[noise] what are the things I found so fascinating in your book is that you chose to organize\nPart of the book by different cuisines across the globe give us an example the vinegars that are unique to certain places and how they're ...\nI'm going to go chronologically like the book first I got to go to France and Italy Austrian Japan and back all through North America and in France or you know there's a lot of butter a lot of cream um and it's delicious because of those things but those sauces have vinegar and I have some kind of a city to balance all that out\nYou find vinegar and Bernays you find vinegar in Holland days most of the master sauces but it's not necessarily the thing that we first think of as the primary ingredient\nNeal you remind your region where ... is king\nAnd ... another thing is probably the most ubiquitous vinegar around the world now\nBut the amount that's made for traditional a which is the original ball summit vinegar which really wasn't exported to the states if not worlds until like the Nineteen seventies\nA such a small amount is made that a lot of people have and you can experience that so seeing that vinegar in contacts and seeing that his barely used as an application where you heat it up you know on top of a little age parmesan or strawberries or maybe the accent a stuffed pasta um\nThan in Austria I think quite possibly the greatest vinegar maker in the world lives in Vienna and he is singular in that he makes vinegars from single ingredients a tomato saffron red pepper a trucking Baron ... and\nAnd makes these things that are so linear and pure that I've never tasted a vinegar so expressive of its you know inherent self\nAnd then you have things like ... an Asian cuisines\nThis was another thing that I had only really experienced\nYou know ... or ms counter ... Khan rice vinegar the things you buy in supermarkets but when you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much\nExpression [laughter] there's so much\nTear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor are dependent on what kind of rice they use and how much is polished down and on top of that you know the traditional Raisman or coma zoo as probably the standard the gold standard of rights many years in Japan but then there's the suit is red vinegar\nMade from the age ... and it literally turns almost black and ... wouldn't boxes before it's pressed um then there's ... from the southwest of the ... province and black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... and art and vinegar but what some of the elements maybe some more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell vinegar is nothing more than four to six percent a CD acid and solution and that solution is water so kind of like wind there all these volatile Esther as these aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with a CD gas it and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but\nVinegar or a is often the sensation before it's a flavor\nSo you think that on your palette you you have that you know feeling of brightness of lightning it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it is a carrier but the thing that it initially does is open up your palate to be able to experience those flavors\nIf anyone is going to get a snake vinegar at home it's going to be you said it's hell adult life [laughter] what some of the basic tools we need to get started well\nYou need a good juice I'm vinegar is made from any starch that can convert into sugar that can turn into an alcohol and then eventually become vinegar or see the gas it\nSo you have to find one of those bases ah starches include grains and races sugars include honey and Cain um fruits and vegetables as well so you have to define what you want to make it up because you have to figure out what you're going to use it for then after that it's kind of like ... you just need a ... that can carry\n[laughter] thanks for having me [noise]\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at America's Test kitchen you can find those who viewed recipe for Mexican roast pork coach need a peace deal that splendid table dot org [noise]\nComing up I get to talk with you and we have a love story that evolved over boisterous I've read this lab and this is the splendid table from ATM American public media [noise]\nServing Rhode Island in southeastern Massachusetts\nIssues the public radio eighty nine point three of them [noise] our funding comes from listeners like Deborah from Providence in Adler\nEach featuring seat to premium paint ... decorative hardware fabrics window treatments and wall coverings all month long advisors R.

[noise]\nWe are as Amanda on the line from Decatur, Georgia him and how are you good how are you I'm well thank you what would you like to talk about\nSo about a year ago I went to my friend ... challenged beautiful likely that writer and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my friend got me one single at all ... the joke and then for my birthday this year he got me the ... and ... it can make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make with them and I accidentally get a little bit I made chicken like right there I made 'em some ... that that's really all I Know how did you and I would love to be able to use the more I shall off you know a great guess\nHer so you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal casts arm Fraser about what size it\nUm I Would say probably watching ... pretty large\nOh big you know we got a big oh yeah oh cool\nAnd then you have some cats aren't cookouts which was like there was a little mini brings it was right and how big are those are the semi shape so and I can\nOkay so what's those I have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more than ... um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread and there were like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or do for like a breakfast or ... exactly what you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake\nThey're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation ... um but you're twelve or fourteen ... razor another they were talking because that is a really fun to be the requirement to have [noise]\nI think for that I Want to talk to you about in general what I think that kind of hot does really well so what I think it's a beautiful about like a big cast iron enamel braille you say is\nA cast iron so holds heat really well and I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action and there would you certainly can but\nFor me I think what's exciting about that is that it can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking at a less intense temperature and so what that means to me is if your searing say you know\nShort ribs you want to do some brave short ribs or if you want ... chicken and you want to see the skin or you want to do\nSort of like heartier cut of meat\nI think what's great is you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like ripping up the all the way high you know what I mean and you know get the oil and there and get your proteins like pat dry with paper towel seasonal um lamb and they're gently and what's really nice about that as you can get such a\nMore intense or like a deeper seer is maybe a better way to describe it\nAnd the pan holds that heat so well and it you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good see her on all four sides of the short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut you know just really get that searing nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nYeah and that's something I didn't really think that would that ended up ... like I said what kind of stealing or breathing are no longer not smart see things more like ... ...\nYeah and what's really awesome then though is once you get that really nice dark fear\nThem what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't burnt so then you continue to use that to a Braves like you said in the studio and that's when you add your liquid you cannot you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using and it just builds so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on put an oven\nAnd I just think it's great for that kind of cooking it looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off just server right in the pot 'cause it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt's almost like it's one of those yes it's like [laughter] it's like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter] oh yeah it was it was perfect for about a stick\nSurfing will enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to tell you did All right let us know goes was Louis and making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank you so\nWe have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not because they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make zucchini noodles and he wants to learn how to cook those ... noodles like noodles they turned out machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more than say um I don't know exactly how this gentleman's cooking his zucchini noodles but I think\nMy first gut reaction is to say probably what you want to do is\nCooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher he because what happens is when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's still zucchini and zucchini a cooks really fast\nAnd get soft really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan then what's gonna happen is you know the stuff on the surface of the pan is cooking and getting soft and the stuff in the middle isn't quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest as divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your pan ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want to do whatever the recipe is and just give them a quick tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do that until you get all you can you talk [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredients let us know what are the things that you use of you know we might have never thought to use and we have Erica on the line from Seattle right now to tell us about her Hey Eric how are you\n[noise] I just I'm good how are you I'm well thank you so what is your secret ingredient\nSo my secret ingredient is and mommy outer [noise] I'm In ... and ... and ... mushrooms and that are ...\nVery fine how are you a ... you know our big chicken for example the typical thing\nOh Neal that was phenomenal\nOh cool where do you buy this [noise]\nNo I've made it I can tell you the recipe if you'd like [laughter] no I usually do about\nSix tablespoons of Bonita flakes and then an ounce each of ... mushrooms ... called ... seaweed yes Columbus even [noise] um the ... and you don't have to reconstituted or anything like that you just use it as it and I usually just to break it up\nA little bit more just to have it set in the grinder and then I granted either in a blender or coffee grinder that usually works better because it really gives it to this nice fine powder", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Providence", "day": "27"}
