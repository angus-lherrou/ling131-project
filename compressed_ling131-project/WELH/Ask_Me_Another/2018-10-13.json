you end up becoming an actor I wasn't that very good at school [laughter]\nYeah I Know I'm no I really wasn't I wasn't great at it I went to school because I wanted to be on the number of things really um but I said to myself oh maybe I'll child journalism and and so I I started taking political science courses and communication and I was like oh I think I'm going to be a diplomat\nThat's really hard to\nOn so then you know and then I didn't know it was like okay you know what I'm going to figure it out maybe law school who knows um and then yeah and then I kept on trying different things to like I hear\nAnd did you did you take a acting classes or did you just start auditioning like how are you ...\nWell I went to performance art high school right on when I was a kid I when I was in high school and so I was very familiar with the arts and\nStarted taking acting classes so I just went to like beginning acting and beginning improv and so I kept on taking classes like that and I moved to New York and I I joined us a school that was sort of like a cold\nIt was scary um but it really did preparing to know\nThat health yeah yeah there were certainly a big on the skin um\nYeah they uh they made me cry every day somehow I could not crying a dancing [laughter]\nSo I what I did was I just started\nAuditioning and then I started working yeah yeah and this is graduation

more of these um within the last two years I've been giving talks a different universities um\nI've gotten better [laughter] and so this one um it was special because I was actually getting a degree along with everybody else and I actually didn't uh get my degree from region is when I went there I was like a semester ... yeah\nYeah she credits so this was pretty grocery I see I but of course all I I went to a Catholic all women's college now it's not all women's anymore but you know all all of my um the nuns because there were still nuns teaching our professors\nA and they all came up to like this is nice but you can finish [laughter]\nYou can finish you have you just have a few critics lots of um like just leave me alone on line classes call me later [laughter]\nNow you're big acting break came in two thousand and twelve when you were cast in orange is the new black as Murray to re most a Bronx bread character with Colombian roots now it seems that the show managed the impossible it's a huge ensemble cast\nWhere everyone supposedly liked each other uh what is the secret ingredient\nJust just be around women [laughter]\nHave everyone to be a woman [laughter] and\nI you know from experience it's a really great environment you know it's so funny 'cause people like would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past like catty women riding\nHis you know the ... competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable in groups of women in spaces where it's like female run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really loved being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and you were forced to basically fend for yourself\nUh-huh how did you manage [noise] um so\nI you know I had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present 'em in our household and so\nI was just always sort of like an outsider look looking in you know actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who was a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had a um very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue going and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and ... and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed\nIn life I guess I just wanted to figure out a way to be happy and to um you know I figure I'll ...\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story um luckily I\nThought maybe my voice could be an asset you're hot [laughter] I'm way because\nEspecially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and and different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not\nThat we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf you move the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nWho was it was like cats at a bag and do all this work [laughter]\n\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like over here struggling in Hollywood and like nobody wants to give me a job [laughter] you know unless it was you know some drug dealers girlfriend on [noise] and and here I Am putting myself in this does you know do all this work on top of this\nWork yeah and it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah called in the country we love my family divided and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it was being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah ... it is called my family divided one girl's journey of home loss and hope what is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already that easy\nBook um and why do people come up to me all the time it's\nLike your book I read it in one sitting it's easier\nYeah I I at the end of her younger students [laughter] those are the students have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult [noise] so yeah that is why you found it easy [laughter]\nAnd now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series well\nTrying okay I'm In talks right now of developing on either a series or a ... um I can take in many different directions but that's sort of like when I'm I'm getting into right now animated series archer novels yeah
