C. and so that that was something that I always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious paths\n[laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics were jumping in the air\nFor what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training is this five years you've been already has shown me up on six\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of those six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got caught and um I learned was great yeah ... right now I can juggle plates so that's sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah and yeah\nYou see the show you do this incredible back band that makes every one gasp yeah and that's fair that I can I get thank you to a you know John at the notion yeah my contortion teacher amazing oh okay\nI was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot and you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it is made you a more optimistic person\nDo I I mean I I have the privileges you know being the sponge\nTo an eight shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's been a\nGradual increase yeah I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yeah and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like I Do and I\nI'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he was like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends ended up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one people tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to scapegoat others and with sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself\nYou know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days\nThat feels really like a ... [noise]\nUh All right are you ready for an ask me another challenge yes I Am fantastic of course you are so even we actually found a pretty amazing opponent for you please welcome the Tony nominated book writer of sponge Bob square pants\nThe musical Kyle Jericho every body\n\nKyle thanks for being on the show as well happy to have you ... okay so you you wrote the book how many years did you have you been working on this project I think I've been\nInvolved almost six years okay yeah here's\nWhat is the evolution of the story of sponge Bob square pants the musical what is the evolution of the story has it changed from day one yeah it has\nI mean we knew okay here's the challenge rights but from a TV they're eleven minute episode yes Broadway show you may be aware as nine eleven minutes long just a little longer a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks the emotional stakes that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening\nSo pretty early we sat on the idea there is going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right and then the exact version of end of the world changed a bunch but we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meets sponge Bob\nSpongebob in his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that is going to destroy it and people are freaking out they look fish fish are perfectly fish\nFor sure you have to clarify the I just saw myself and every single one of those fish\nAnd the girls were ... who is who is a mammal and there is a subtle thing where everyone ends up turning on the mammal and even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home\nWhich of course seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this entered the script\nYou know interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy the squirrel is only land mammal right are you there are aquatic mammals there's a whale but she's the only land mammal thank you I like you I I don't mind below so personally I can you on it [laughter]\nSo anyway we always thought wrote a story about people turning against each other dealing with fear the idea of scapegoating somebody it just you know that's what happened yet so she as the outsider seemed like you know really clear way to tell that story sadly the world has really caught up and I think it's\nFelt even more relevant than it did even when we did\nIt's this American
