searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate and their parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan me and her three in the back room telling about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that [noise]\nMaine's Susan flipping through one of those time life books rock and roll through the decades sixties

anything it's fine but green like tell me what he said what did he say to you I stay silent I Know if I tell her what he said she'll get out of the car and try to kick his ass which scares me the comforts me to\n\nSusan Jordan was our babysitter [noise] she watched my sister and me every day after school for a couple of hours until our parents got home from work [noise] we didn't know any adults like her we loved her December before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\n\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen the cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and this is Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I check them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has to be some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nAnd tell her to hold on I'll Try to get my break we can catch up\nShe says great steps aside [noise]\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nI keep Clinton behind Susan making project gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at me\nFinally she touched me in the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at thrift way for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\nOn\n\nThe drives me crazy that I never saw her again [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having or play with him he seemed like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it'd be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that moment\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things\nAbout me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nMy mom or do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do you remember she was in Jordan right\nSure\nSure yes it's bringing about that I Can't place a she was our babysitter oh OK chicken like in my past\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter really add more of a relationship which is that she did when I seem to have a very meaningful relationship with you um are\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and\nWell I was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] it's only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean that people are complicated now what I really wanted to spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out [laughter] and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it see sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family um\nOoh\nEvery time the subject of a hard times came up\nA hero settle hesitancy and Susan too is\nThe first I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly no it wasn't until we\nBeen talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she\nTo kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people are and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but ah [noise]\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be devastating if I hurt anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ...\nParts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe person who's in Jordan you're pro life that I remember\nIs he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like right there\nDidn't think of myself as where it all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine of anxious and bookish\nNot to see him as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like he had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like there were mostly books and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that ... had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had a baby that ... more serious in general so mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other or even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we needed to about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she must have remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house but there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that ... people lived differently than the way I Lived and that's what I decided I wanted for myself and\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recordings or you can find someone who knew you back then someone you haven't seen since they still carry within themselves the picture of you to some clouded by the years between\nThe remember you better than you remember yourself and you can do the same thing for them\nI was\n... he did that started back when he was a producer here at our show no even had kept me company called ... media and he's the host podcast without fail rule\nTo hunker in a gray flannel suit [noise] for a long time David filled with the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in Beverly Hills as you might imagine the Beverly Hills they handle rather large mortgages dresses beautiful clothes clean cut back in the night\nThey had called the automatic they were never really big commercial success but they were respected known in the history of pomp by people who care about that kind of thing\nThat a few years back there not series of connections he ended up revisiting his teenage years for the first time but going back on tour in a version of his band in Japan here is that something that happens I mentioned it to a client\nAnd and I said well you know I I played in um in the ... when I when I was a kitten and uh you know really interested in and then the next day he sent me a copy of them\nAre even ... inside is this year and I said before so it was not watch this option I watched the the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize wait a minute [laughter] time collectible\n[noise]\nLet's get down to brass tacks or how much we I think that one actually went to forty\nEight dollars I particularly like looking as you know all those sort of ah other groups that were going and twenty five cents [noise] um [noise] you know music video business a false offerings along punk climbs\nOr that you know I don't want to live on ... at the time and it was good to see that uh [noise]\nYou know that their their ... value here later I mean it was it was ... that history came out on the rights of it yes that ah there is a sort of Darwinism a fading in uh in record collection [noise]\nWhatever that I went to conceive Vicki the drama and and\nRicky collected everything and he very kindly lent me uh these two scrapbooks so I took pictures and and things out of that I just put it up on a had a friend put it up on a website\nAnd um\nThen I got an email from ... in um\nIn Japan's saying you know tighten Japanese punk rock ... band and or if he's a member of a person yes and uh your record changed my life wow ... ... and he found out through the website that you know there was an on release down somebody else you know if you could put me in touch with a ...\nOf a base Michael Woods which we struck up a deal and then they said well would you come over here and play some gigs to uh you know for my age\n[noise]\n\nSo so you go to ... how old are you at that point a forty five forty five years old or a little bit of gray hair coming into the middle ground hack coming in and uh\nAnd and what really wasn't sure whether I'm you know I'd still be able to do it because I haven't played those songs in twenty two years\nYou know not in my shower no to any one uh I mean\nPrior to being married I mean I remember dating women for you know uh yeah who never knew that I played as it has had ever played\n... you know they wouldn't even come up\nWouldn't come out really I may not have a good time you around but you know lots of other guys did to would you ever pick of the guitar and play for yourself yes I read a lot of songs my dog during this period [laughter] some of the titles would be we going to the park was a big favorite\nTo be followed by that here too is a good boy [laughter] what a good boy is actually a it is [noise] what a lot of good boy [laughter] [noise]\n[noise]\n... ah we whenever they want the October the sick to buy why which\nPossibly with a ... was a miscalculation but [laughter] no he's a good thing to take my wife gets or are you you're approached by dozens of teenage girls\nI was getting stumped on the street so what happened the first that you went onstage well there was just you know the announcement\nThe light [noise] until the moment science which lasted ...\nThat it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for\nHistory for people to know the deep thoughts of young Zionists as he prepared as way to lead nation [noise]\n\n... or or regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this\nDiary remain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this attitude seconds me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being I Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than ... ...\nAnd watch out will generate here comes the Adam is on Capitol [laughter] [noise] wow [laughter] [noise]\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] oh that's a that's kind of thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise]\nYeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see I mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] like amazing that you're in your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably that's right that's gone through a site that at some point or the baseball game or something in that sense right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the juice for everything and the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive than anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't\nRecording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just a sixteen year old kid who is you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean\nMaybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy yeah I think um\nI didn't have much anxious about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter] I Know it's just kind of a\nMaybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ...\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson a would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed and very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course if all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your petty little craft in your little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed Pacific\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I Want it for myself what you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at sixteen yeah that's very true yeah you'd be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio appease\nIt would seem like I'd settled in the ... that are way\nAdam Davidson\nThese days staff writer for the new\nBoy when we were angels\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get him to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like story from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it bully sound like story on our show\nIt's a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIf not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top half\n[noise] it was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\nUm [noise]\nGot aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] I guess basically got up on a on the back and he started yelling and screaming about how he was held back never said he was [noise] and um [noise]\nI think actually right after that I might have gotten that far back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord of effort that was\nPretty it is I\n\nGuess I bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good or bad of me thinking along [laughter] killer pat\n\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over campus that debt in both pretty high end nine feet tall ... giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea to put them up\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nScott decided he would go to the cloud to dispense aside time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giants [noise]\nHe gave giant nana booming voice\nDogs actually was something like you know I'm trying to ...\nWeird [noise] you know sort of thing [laughter] you know I don't know\n[noise]\nGot asked his college friend hold on to act as giant men's legs\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln wrapped around their mental hide who knows\nAnd a black really way like the guy I think\nWe picked up a point in the bushes pulled out on that I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out on the quad and for the hockey game and I got on the shoulder effects way up to their bike around my waist and we walked out\nThat I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people for people try\nAnd I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was like a handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all sort of coming to
