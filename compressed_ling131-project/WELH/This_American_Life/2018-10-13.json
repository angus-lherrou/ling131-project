{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "Tonight at eight on the public radio eighty nine point three ask them\nTo school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training the running to first drill in the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes [noise]\n[noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district in rural Ohio the record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team this year was pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations over the school I saw that brought a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to pay for this was one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThough did fire during these drills [noise]\nSo the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the ... you had to put your finger on the sensor is I don't think of something\nRight and it's a little tricky\n\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shooter [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six to twelve he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise] he's got a gun Israel bullet proof vest he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and\nOne of these shootings another kid can be killed not enough of this way [noise]\n\nElementary awareness in elementary when [noise]\nUnless you're willing to building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically goes into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nDoes robbing he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nYours are here we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they\nFind the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything but just timing the response and it wasn't great\nThat wasn't going to turn in the ... the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nWell I I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force\nA long time for help I don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise] and so I went out\nAnd started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle it down\nAnd which is different you know first time you should have gone that's pretty scary it was scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you after in vision this is a shooter\nIn your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss there's a possibility somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts us doing it in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating are worth thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nDid she didn't do just continue to happen [noise]\nDid they interpret them we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings that looks at past just pay the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who invented something that actually seems to work and help\nW ... Chicago it's this American Life America ...\n\nEdwin ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think I'd have been more prepared than than in any way to get elected\nSell sell hats\nPast but I have for their families\nThe training they received save lives that day or didn't it was actually an open question when our producers Robin ... went to a park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well they did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nWas an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMost of all ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher in that news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for every this is what a code black is this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were ... silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors of paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nAnd that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing are cool what she did\nActually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and laugh and\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nKind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied closet someone said told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet\nIt was hot and dark except students faces led by their cell phones Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax law that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was grace in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nThe herd noises in the hallway I'm without really quiet um had has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in around and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police's anyone here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your\nFirst time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that in training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they have their weapons drawn she really just had the\nAnd not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands in polls that closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see is the teacher who's our most grazed [noise] she survived Scott Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated waited\nA little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way go\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in a rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having\nA playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive\nBecause of it what might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson research is what the fact of and these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of the things I knew that done at Douglas\nLike tapering over windows\nCheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings\nConsumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision\nI told her about actually curse how she'd stunner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student [noise] remember it was a break from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I Wonder if\nThat's the problem with that and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes one thing that was part of the training of Douglas was barricade in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door\nBut most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did just actually had\nDone it and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids in her room from the hallway\nShut the on barricade herself first\nFewer kids would admitted in [noise]\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school button hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one\nClassroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nWant my daughter to know everything [noise]\nAllowed her to know about barricade him [noise]\nAnd I want her to know about running in fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because it's a thing to recognize\nAll want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school shelves point about don't say codes\n... like it is\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I was a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\nOf\nThis year at Douglas there are new Gates's new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits in every room Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one and they already did a code\nYou know the evidence is going on in this world [noise] taking drugs you would not get a share serves because stress for your drug stores are still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year [noise] develops those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several destination lawsuits when the Philips is ran into him face to face and a gun control that he accused him of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration in on it and I'm listening to him just going\nYou are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy's stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous\nAfter the Philips his son gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved demanded was threatening him ended up in jail so hope there's or one of the things the Philips has worn parents about to tell families to brace themselves\n[noise] mhm [noise] mhm [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's find called Sandy from the theater the minute\nI picked up the phone there was [noise]\n[noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting I like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and something I've never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ... held her\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventeen people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting Sandy Hook or twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had somebody to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they\nFelt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence you know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking almost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I looked like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy said that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the ... there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship\nThat they couldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents have lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe to Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of date however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal light moment brothers should they should dream of shame as you were shouldn't you know let me explain something to your right I'm not the same person I never will be they should as we're obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nPeople to understand that the grief number fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes this informal support groups even more crucial\nWas that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who got it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland on a couldn't that store at I met them at\nTheir house their son's name was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops but said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mentioned on the\nPhone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard neck was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting another set a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she saw patient who match next description [noise] by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning you see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from ...\nThan their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\n... we couldn't even find your son you know and I thought that he was somewhere else and have to give them thinking maybe he walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nHonest says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about Nick\nAnd the person that answered the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas ... swimmer oh this summer's perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like he was he was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his chops destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him\nYes he was awful because your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an error Fifteen just\nSo gross I'm so horrible horrible\nAnd I think to see him and to see on his body where his injuries were were um", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
