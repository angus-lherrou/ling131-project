judge Kavanaugh I'm not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just isn't sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certain to go out of this rain today and uh and just have a little humility on that front section\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the Ford cabinet testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't this off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision a vote 'em there's been this just\nA debate for staff discussions late last night too and

did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR but he says he wasn't thinking about that at all\nSo he comes back and then Coons gives a speech at the committee meeting that he said was direct\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to them in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am Sam presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied with the FBI before\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nA joyous people [laughter] that's what we're only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child to stand in the

recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court\n[noise]\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and uh the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\nSome some southern southern southern southern slanted or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience

issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case and it's not just reverse of our

a few minutes so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the briefs the second

just get right to it\nThe story comes stretching type cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with it wouldn't make right with another person usually it's something that had been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays a kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is

forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean well I I wasn't sure how to\nIs that a ... ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nOr he did begin to reply but I didn't\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and are just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like you're really read things are [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was set the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened\nGlen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you

address as well as my phone number with no reply she also\nForward to her original emailed us then once you send two years ago when he can't stop thinking about but I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word\nInstead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much and just so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\n...
