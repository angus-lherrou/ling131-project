{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "Tonight at six on Rhode Island public radio member in the news was boring politics is boring that happened right\nWing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it I don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively\nReading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same about income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst [noise] I think to the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so why don't like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there\nAre people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today\nAnd I shall we have somebody in that situation in our\nFirst act Arizona Senator Jeff flake\nAnd the second act we leave Washington behind if somebody who's literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] with no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] both those people\nHaving to make these huge decisions they are not comfortable with all the [noise] the b._b._c. Chicago to this American Life America stay with us [laughter]\n\n[noise] but [noise] judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the journal on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over use undecided and seem like it now on Kavanaugh there was a yes it was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nA British as though he chases spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording in for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is\nThere's always the first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind [laughter]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview just sleeps fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the vote and now he was ...\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick it declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that confrontation has had her play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm closed with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[laughter] [noise]\n... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential there were lots of others don't and I'm reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAnd on line said support the heroes who convinced Leighton reads over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to see\nHere's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true\nFirst of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and they do this morning that they have any long term I also we talked about it wasn't but I Do think there was a\nIt was the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories of sexual assault\nIt's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand in calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nEasily Portland support what do you believe in one way and therefore we when we when you think what do you have to say something you can save it went in right now in the survivors glad we're having this er into\nYeah are you going to get it right than\nDoes it affect you and people like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe week making fun of himself we talked about this before like lots of men his age doesn't connect you well two emotions [noise]\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh I'm\nNot sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going to a deal like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not [noise]\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's always got and I would just urge colleagues to recognize that it is we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt asserting to go out of this room today\nHumility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the Ford cabinet testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger was off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat and um it's been it's just a ... debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\nThe next morning of course we finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the end you've got to come back to\nThat person should have been a ...\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV and to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that freaks he yes\nHe chokes up reportedly says oh and then we each make choices for our own reason I'm struggling sorry a lot of tears in the capital those two days the meeting begins\nThe two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably check Twitter because usually does but he says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR it says he wasn't thinking about that at all\nSo he comes back and then Coons gives a speech at the committee meeting that he said was directed at one man\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied that the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you you're kind of back among among your people\nA draft people [laughter] that's a terrible temper only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no file to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\nEver [noise]\n\nVery chase ... of a program that turn out of this a recording that we found of Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since you went through all that well I like my own uh [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in the political way\nThe famous new there\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament the commitment of the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about that [noise]\nSo so so so so that so the so the Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people ask them by the state cases you'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way it was funny\nHow it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and um and discuss the case\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case and it's not just reverse refer him it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get and let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of off as we realized one of us will have to\nWrite an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nUh an opinion that explains\nThe teach the\nPrinciples of war the principles of the constitution or the controls will result\nIn when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on a capital of trust we make a withdrawal and the trust that in the public has in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nMy story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how we talk about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly\nDo that I said well I'm I have four clerks and divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and they're very difficult cases\nI Will take them home and read the brief the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost\nThe odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty I here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I'd lost the audience but I was safe because the attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those briefs I said oh it is that either one six pack brave and it just expect\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack brave [laughter]\nThanks to the farm club for the Palm Beach is that a recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete amateur\nHas to decide a death sentence is only previous experience in these matters\nWatching law and order that's in a minute ... radio when our program continues

someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays a kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is a more serious one\nI mean here's Johnny books there\nIn two thousand and eight ... received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on the way I Hope it don't get jury duty but I was more curious and interested in like the the process and you know I like to watch and stuff like law and order and other things like that\nSVU criminal intent spend like them all he was a software developer newly married and he and his wife just bought a new house his first\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should forgiven may hands if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing\nThat there's that forgiveness it's also weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nOr he did begin to reply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and it just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like I really read things uh [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was set the state would put post story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and you'd have to carry the parents of the victim came forward\nIt seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not like Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance and opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore\nAt at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise] for not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not drawing\nShame leads to a nurse or\nHow does even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you ... object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external force base in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with ... and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my\nPhone number with no reply she also\nForwards originally emailed us fan once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about\nWhen I read it expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that span consumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place\n... I I was joking I have\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can see opera fusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea\nMaryland is child in stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester all makes you you have melons because she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of the ones that everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about a safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family memoir Powell is the cause of all of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay\nBut that's much how and I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it costs me my job\nTo move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a ...\n... um in in\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland right fans article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay that sentence the death penalty\nI had died I thought I had literally died they didn't even register because I'm just like what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read an okay what are they thinking what are they doing\n'em I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he is and I want people to know you know everybody's ... they assumed that if you are involved in a heinous crime like that the true a monster but he wants them to muster\n[noise]\nIf there is no okay so he's going to come up Marilyn and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for\nI think that probably is an ... ... as the and it's been a fan\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before he gets it [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans spend is at the door [noise]\nThen I draw in the evenings and Aaron's here now how do you\nThat then there was no okay\nI get a lot of a vent lingers in the door the hotel room\nAnd a have a seat over there uh\nHis spectacles neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous [noise] and so there were there with a lifetime Maryland in ... and then in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent sat and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside or you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] a rather than I re read it and I even began so her letters or never went anywhere and I don't know what to say what did you say about that\nI don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the vote was cast I regret I thought I'm doing wrong fan\nAlthough it was great hearings out your forgave there couldn't forgive myself exactly and I can't even imagine how you must feel\nOkay first of all I Want to say I don't want you to feel shame because you know my son was involved in a in a in a crime um he made a wrong choice", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
