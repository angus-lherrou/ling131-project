G. it just school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with guns French and the boxes\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district ... hire the best record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe date people on this team and we to teachers all do it for the rest are a guidance counselor to custodians through administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team pollock watch them doing this\nWe used to so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations of at the school [noise] I saw the ride a bunch of drugs and then all of them the goal was to run to the air safe get the guys out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible\nAnd they time each drought okay we're gonna play tape a decision to warn listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire during these drills so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team\nMembers actually had trouble getting into the safe now you have to put your finger on the sensor is I don't think of something\nAnd it's a little tricky might\n[noise]\nThere's a share of that many he's playing the shit [noise]\nAnd following a guy named John he's the principal for grade six to twelve [noise] and he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun he's wearing a bullet proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds and one\nShootings and other kitchen counter nothing nothing this way\nElementary awareness and they all manner in a way [noise]\n\n[noise] I'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principles running down the hallway and he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the focus into lockdown\nThe heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... first keys and he's trying to find the right one\n... he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go [noise] Erica [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything and just tightening the response and it wasn't great\nThat was an attorney and he compared the first yeah oh yeah it was it was a guy here to the doors\n\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force ... so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right\nThing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and\nAnd so I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out\nAnd started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it's scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very liberal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd one exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter\nIn your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss [noise]\nI Can't miss because if I miss there's a possibility if somebody else getting her\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts a student in my school\nOf course he might have to shoot one of his students in a lot of these shootings that's who the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking\nI I wouldn't have believed but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\n\nThey shouldn't do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shootings it'll to pass it would just be the future [noise]\nBush shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly can [noise] and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help WB easy Chicago it's this American Life am Ira Glass [noise]\nMhm [noise] mhm [noise]\n[noise]\nLike one ... will never be\nFor any school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than the workday I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that we still had\nCasualties have these people to I'm going\nDo the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question when our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive once she and other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those\nSchool did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period ... this is what a code black is this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that then you still say we're apt to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten the school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors of paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nAnd that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not living are cool\nWhat she did\nRemembers being trained with other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing there were terrified people reading and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what she'd been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\nHer classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group is small enough to fitness apply apply that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the class\nHe says look by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she tax she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there was a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been grazed by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers had this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time I set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooters and I know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to be\nAn even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see the teacher who's our most grade is she survived Scott Beagle and the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the store way do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study\nAnd they both told me that having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives in mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson researches what effective and these drills at ... university and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas like he'd bring over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's\nTwo o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ...\nAll the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you stay in your room sometimes you evacuate like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you fight basically trust your ability to make a decision\nI told her about actually occurs how sheets the doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student remember it was a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with that and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional locked down at her school sweating hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one a classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nI Want her to know about barricade him\nAnd I want her to know about running in fighting back\nI Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to reckon with\nAll wanted to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOh one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about don't take codes\nCall it like it is\nI Want someone to say listen I as a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\nOr\nIf you're at Douglas there are new Gates's new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits in every ram Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one\nAnd they already did a code red trail only this\nThe virus is going on in this world goes away it's not going to change just because they're strictly drugs or drugs or if you're still able to do and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a second but they're also advocates for universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks person could buy\nHowever Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents\nTo avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are big he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit\nHe accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and on it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shoving match was about to start until Sandy's stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists notice truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting\nThis can get dangerous after the Philips is on gave interviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail so hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves oh\nMhm mhm [noise] mhm\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse friend called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was screaming just\n[noise]\nArnold screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting site what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I'd been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I tried\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and took to never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch where he held her\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook or twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the thoughts as\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asks if they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy so they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they\nFelt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nKnow it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know and I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces\nAnd he said that's what made it look like five months ago\nWhich is that look like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy says it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away\nFrom well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson these parents had lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe to Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to\nThis is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on which they want you to get back to normal light ... should they should not shame as you were shouldn't you know ... you're right I'm not to shrink person on there will be the shooters were obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it [noise]\nThe Philips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away people who were closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial [noise] [noise]\nWhat's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland Monica in that store at and let them at their house\nThere is something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops which said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mentioned ... phone calls\nAnd tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd\nBeen moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from neck they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area\nIs that in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped and think is Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comments can we have to find your son and as you say [noise]\nI'm at two o'clock in the morning you see this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time\nAnd he hears screams from nature and then their names were called out even walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\n... we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I thought that he was somewhere else\nAnd have to keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot and he was never brought to the hospital to second nightmare\nMixed body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nOn August says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answered the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again I think it was for a taste a swimmer swimmer is perfect [noise] I think it meant that there was nothing on his face or his head like he was he was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his chops destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him\nYes it was awful because your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an era Fifteen just\nSo gross something so horrible horrible\nAnd I think to see him and to see on his body whereas injuries were were um", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "14"}
