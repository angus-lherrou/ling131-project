going people are lined up halfway to the back of the store I look up and their shoes and Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I check them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has made some kind of business card her husband's probably something

me crazy that I never saw her again [noise] [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play with to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that moment\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nI'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do I Do you remember she was in Jordan Wright\nIs George George\nYes it's ringing up out but I Can't place a she was our babysitter oh OK chicken like my pet\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I wanted to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really add more of a relationship with you too and she did with us\nShe seemed to have a very meaningful relationship with you um are the kind of a relationship that might have like another adult\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember usa fama those because I think it works both ways I think that we still hope is that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded well\nHow was desperately I guess I was looking for a family\nThat I mean it [laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean they're people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy and though a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out [laughter] and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it see sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise] ooh\n\n[noise] every time the subject for hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy and Susan's with\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly\nIt wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing it or our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different Mm\nThere are parts of your past you don't want to go back to ...\nParts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe procedures in Jordan you're for life that I remember\nIs he or she just as soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like right now\nDidn't think of myself as where it all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine I was anxious and bookish\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your rooms I didn't it didn't seem like you

and I didn't remember that cake had hardly any dolls you didn't seem quite at play full as other kids that I had babies that ... just been more\nMainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nOr\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had received us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan that she doesn't think about much her talk mess in the face of hardship [noise] she said she must be remembered the side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keep people lived differently than the way I laughed and that's what I did I wanted from I Know\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening

me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for\nHistory for people to know the deep thoughts of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to lead his nation [noise]\n\nAnd that our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\n... made me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing if the lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes out of it was on Capitol [laughter]\nWow [laughter] [noise]\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] oh that's a\nThat's a kind of hazing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help

blamed the juice for everything in the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I\nFor the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive to anyone who would read it would immediately become designer [noise]\n\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating\nThis ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl or kiss him and being scared and confused about growing old I'm On the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about being\nThe future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it was just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ... and\n[noise] I Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the reading from this\nDiary I think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation [noise] you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhat you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah he would be very very disgusted\nTo be heard this this radio appease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the New York\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like a story from this American Life\nUnsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week Joe ... we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music to the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nDid a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch your guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top half\nThere was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise] um [noise] thought aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad\nAnd I guess basically got I'm On I'm On someone's back and he started yelling and screaming about how he was and how magnificent he was and I'm\nActually right after that I might have gone back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter] and uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was pretty amazing\nI\nGuess I bought a lot about it um it actually good or you know burned me thinking along [laughter] a peculiar path\n\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the way to class he saw signs all over campus and that that in both pretty I Am nine feet tall and see giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who puts them up\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nGot decided he would go to the plot to specify time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in costumes for the giant\nGiant nana booming voice\nPart or even know exactly it was something like you know I'm ... years old I Am trying you know just the you know loud but just kind of weird [noise] you know sort of [noise] suggesting that [laughter] way you know I don't know\n[noise]\nIt's kind of asked his college friend who does access giant men's legs\nThick ... soup we're heading up to the plot\nOf blankets wrapped around their middle high Toyota\nIn a lot really way like the guy I think\nWe picked up a point in the Bush is put on that I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out on the quad and for the time came and I got on the shoulder effects way up to their bike around my waist and we walked out\nThat I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people Fifteen people try and I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was the other is like\nA handful of people and they were so spread out but they're all coming to work for her I was like you know what the what the hell am I doing here",
