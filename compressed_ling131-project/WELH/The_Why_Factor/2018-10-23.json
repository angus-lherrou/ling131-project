Instagram post for me would probably be a bowl of maybe a smoothie greens movie she goes so into it that she became a wellness program taking care to post everything she at on Instagram\nMight be some sort of seafood sprinkle on TALK maybe some edible flower [laughter]\nAnd then you'd have this caption which is describing\nHow wonderful your morning was because he had this movie\nAn oily amazing benefits so that you might list out all the different ... what they do you like it's a great for your immune system is great for energy I feel ... off to eating this and that was the kind of falling out of the wellness Instagram post\nShe was inspired by an Internet celebrity\nI came across the purse by a really well known wellness blogger and she in particular had talked about how she used a diet to cure ourselves of a chronic illness\nI spoke to Maxine who was also suffering due to a chronic illness\nSo also just ... is a digestive disorder that really depletes the energy of the tea do all the time you ... ... thing\nI reached a point with my health or I didn't feel like the medical institution could offer me much because the medical institution treats health very much on an acute basis as that you have a\nAn illness you get a diagnosis you get treated and then you go on your way but when you've got a chronic illness like also to collect just there's no treatment models full that there's no long term plan it's just if you have a flare up here's some medication and then we wait until the next ... says to me I didn't feel like\nThat was ever going to walk me and so I tended to kind of distance myself from ...\nFrom Maxine she lived to food I'm had died to answer questions which stokes who couldn't\nStarted seeing for you to very much and the key to healing lap so I cut out policemen dairy refined\nHelping I think to an extent it was all very much psychological I've told everything about why wasn't each change that was it didn't leave a whole lot to be eating so I was incredibly nutrient deficient so I lost my period for three and a half years\nI'm going to the diet due to the dye yeah and what you're describing sounds quite dangerous thing absolutely it's definitely dangerous\nOf viva believes that things have to change to\nProvide the best medicine and the best safety for women we really have to start\nUnderstanding why first of all women are so disenfranchised you know this not being seen not being heard not being taken seriously being dismissed being insulted being disregarded and these are all documented phenomenon\nIn the medical literature about this medical biased against women but also start to look at some of the therapies that women really want to\nAs part of their care and start to do more and better research on those\n\nIt's a strange power do so many women are flocking to these practices which are dismissed and seen as not being violent [noise] and yet some of these women seek out wellness off to having that own pain and illnesses dismissed by the medical establishment in the first place [noise]\nIn some ways I find it inspiring women uh taking things into their own hands instead of giving up they been seeking the healing they need\nAnd yet this can leave women vulnerable to practices which may not necessarily helps out much often [noise]\nBut maybe the power of wellness the woman is less about whether a practice will die it works or not\nWomen want to look out for themselves in a holistic way day in day out rather than just hung up to adulthood when there's an emergency\nDignity and self worth and this level of self cat\nMaybe the biggest benefit women get out of wellness is it allows them to be in control of that own trends and healing [noise]\nIf you've enjoyed this episode you may also like a program and why people ... and a program on why people like self help this edition of the wife talked to was presented by me I'm ... and it was produced by class since I had to as Andrew Smith\nBack on the top deck of the bus it was time for me to wake up\n\nFor\nRe change [noise]\nReally this is just too much [noise]", "show_name": "The Why Factor", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "23"}
