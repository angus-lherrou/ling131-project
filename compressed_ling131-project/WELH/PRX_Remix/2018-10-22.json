[laughter] perfect [laughter] perfect broker deliver appear\n[laughter] well that's how they do it all they do or\nHow long did you have to wait the last time you went to see your doctor was it longer than the time you actually spent with the physician what is the only person you saw when you went to the doctor's office was the doctor\nThere is a growing trend micro medical practices were doctors do it all from taking your blood pressure to building your insurance Dr crispy odd has a micro practice in Portland, Oregon the first thing you notice when you come into her office is that there's really no waiting room\nThere's an exam room and a space that looks a lot like a living room where crispy meets with her patients before and after their medical exam\nShe's an internist and pediatrician her patients call her doctor Chrissy she says the in formality is intentional\nPart of the philosophy behind having more accessible approach to medicine is being more I'm more human more ... more accessible I'm In every way\nWhen you graduated from medical school what did you envision in terms of of a job I envisioned\nAnd accepted a job in a multi specialty care center where I worked with probably over a hundred other physicians and had a very busy day of twenty plus patients each day had a panel of close to two thousand patients very quickly\nAnd that's a that's what many primary care doctors expect coming out is just sort of to jump on the treadmill and start running as fast as possible\nDuring the second year of my employment my first job after residency I met a woman named Pamela liable who was a family physician in Eugene Oregon\nAnd Pamela introduced me to this concept of micro practice and it immediately blew my mind and it was three months later that I opened the practice how was the transition how did that occur [noise] it was a phonetic\nTime so contacting insurance companies requesting contract reviewing the contract filling them and with all of my degrees and board certifications and malpractice insurance data\nAnd all of that so it's just a lot of paperwork\nYeah fit normally physicians don't ever see because all they do assigned the bottom line them and a a very helpful administrative person has gathered all of that for them it\nSeems like a short amount of time given all the stuff that you'd have to set up and you had to find a location and you know I even have to hire anybody but um but you didn't have to figure out how you were going to do all the all the jobs so they\nHave in mind that location designed the space by medical equipment\nThe office was a a fell into place I found it on Craig's list and it's half a mile from my home and it's in a quiet corner northeast Portland it's just I I Love my locations awesome\nHow does your colleagues react when you told them I'm leaving this practice and I'm going to start my own practice in this sort of unusual way it's it's not spoken in medical training but there's this sort of\nUm subliminal\nCurriculum that tells you you could never do this on your own it's way too complex and\nWhat I felt and what I've verified is that it doesn't have to be I see fewer patients per day but for me it makes my practice more sustainable it keeps me in love with practicing medicine and keeps me engaged with my patients instead of looking past them or\nFeeling rushed to complete a ten minute appointment so what is it typical day like for you I see my first patient at ten has a two hour administrative break from twelve to to one of those days per week I meet with my ministry of assistant who is relatively new addition and who works remotely\nAverage five to seven patients each day can you can you walk me through sort of a typical appointment like it it starts\nNot with the waiting room right there's no waiting room because there's pretty much no waiting unless somebody arrived early to their appointment so I only see one patient or family in the office at a time and we sit down in a in an area that looks a lot like a living room they're sitting on a sofa I'm sitting in a chair\nAnd we might have tea I'm available for us to share while we're chatting about the reason for their visit\nA after we've talked for a little bit we go into the examination room where it performed physical exam and then we return to the sitting area and I write a prescription or order lab results or discuss the planned whatever it might be with them\nAnd so did you start out doing all of this by yourself you said now you've got an administrative person when you start out doing absolutely everything I started out doing absolutely everything with the exception of book keeping my partner does the bookkeeping for the business\nAnd that also gave us an opportunity to have a small group which allowed us to purchase our own health insurance as a group rather than an as individuals and so what was it like the first year what did you think about going back\nI never thought about going back I really enjoyed this particular style of medicine if someone calls me in the middle of the night with\nA health related emergency I Know who they are now I have a sense of their medical history it's not one of two thousand it's one of\nFour hundred something instead which is much more manageable\nHow long are you spending with each of your patients and new patient visit is usually sixty to Ninety minutes\nI'm a follow up visits is thirty to forty five minutes a well child check is forty five to sixty minutes in previous practices and in most practices it's a luxury to spend twenty minutes at a well child check\nAnd I understand from your website that you are not taking any new patients I I Do have the waitlist it's about six to nine months on average right now I Can't\nSee a lot of new people each week because that would interrupt the availability of same day an urgent need appointments for my existing patients but with this sort of moderated growth it's working really well do you sometimes wish that you could see more people\nI'm pretty happy with the pace of things as it is it's certainly not get rich quick schemes [laughter] I'm In fact I Would caution many physicians who might be ... that you will take a significant pay cut so who covers for you when you go on vacation\nI have a few colleagues in the area and the five of us sort of\nHelp each other out when we go on vacation in fact I was on call for Dr Hudson last week it's obvious how this is better for patients um tell me a little bit more about how it's better for you well I get to sleep in [laughter]\nThat's a really wonderful part of my quality of life right now is that they don't have to get up at five thirty in the morning to be\nAt the office at seven to start seeing as many patients as possible all day long the hours are a blessing to me and again the intimacy with my patients and how well I get to know these families\nReally makes my job a pleasure and sustains my interest in love of medicine are there are there downsides for you I think that the downside potentially is isolation that I don't have a colleague in the office next door\nTo say hey what do you think about this case or can you can look at this raft with me what do you think about this which I Do miss you said that that that this is kind of reflective of your personality is that is that on your end I've been told that I started saying that I wanted to do it all by myself\nAround age two and never stops [laughter]\nVery well or oh ooh\nThat's Dr Chris he or she has a micro practice in

spent long nights teaching ends up everything about nice making surrounded by machines and tools in his basement it would've been easy for George to lose track of the outside world but it turned out he wasn't often alone he had his girlfriend Helen\nHelen which for ... and she would come over and she would\nReally get into it and she would help me\nShe would polish the nice for me you know whatever she could do what you wanted to help but I Would do just bringing downstairs put a wheelchair there there would be so Sam paper and everything she would just go to town we got along we

these kids enough of Helen steal to make another nice something simple in the knife world it would be called an everyday carry it would be plain functional just like it sounds it something you carry every day\nThe thing is George doesn't centered and he'll finish any of these nice\nIn the meantime the one thing George does carry every day is his grief\nIt might seem like he's lost momentum but making steel can be a tricky process and needs to be called slowly to become flexible and strong so like any good nice maker George's being patient he's just giving the steel some time\nFor WC I it's

Antonio's flowers and each perfume is associated with memories or experiences from her life like her grandmother's garden or days by the sea\nBut how on earth do you turn a memory or the smell of a
