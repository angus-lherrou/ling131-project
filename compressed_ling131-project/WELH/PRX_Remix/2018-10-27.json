second batch of stories for the moth radio hour to hear the moth radio hour on the air contact your local public radio station and find out when there'll be airing\nHope you're like [noise] story or a bouncer was before the line from off the agency thousand ten theme of the night was the story of the nearly daily to party or a [noise]\nA from me actually [noise]\nSo I'm a couple\nOf months ago I guess I Walk into the party in New York and uh I see this guy and I see him around that a lot of different parties and a lot of different events and he's a therapist and I always go over to him and I say hello um\nBecause I gravitate towards therapists parties [noise]\nActually sadly consider this progress [noise]\nUm\nI go up to him I say hello and we talk for like you know maybe five minutes and uh and I feel better every time I see this guy and I bumped into him at a party I say hello to him I'm In a better mood\nI think to myself maybe I should have a better plan for my mental health\nThan just bumping into this guy a party [noise] and I think maybe I should go back to therapy [noise] but\nI don't really want to go back to therapy I don't think because I had my thing was I was in therapy for years I had such a clean break with it like I got the tools I needed to sort of go off and not have to do it anymore and it came to a really clean and and\nAnd I don't take for granted because I hear a lot of people talk about therapy and they never quite know when it and you know it's like\nDo do you think you're ready for it and I don't know do you think I'm thinking I'm ready for\nIt [noise] because I think I saw that or [noise]\nAnd this can go on for years [noise] so before I get\nBack in that situation you know I really need to think about it in Nineteen Ninety eight\nMy life wasn't going super hot um and by that I mean I was working at it like a nine to five job that I hated um I was in a terrible relationship really I mean a great person things were just on a downhill slide for a long time I'm largely helped by me I'm sure\nAlso uh I wasn't really doing anything that I Love my idea of of\nWriting which is something I said I wanted to do was to go to restaurant after my nine to five job let out and just drink lots of like mid priced cocktails and eat really bad appetizers and talk about how I I'm probably a genius you\nKnow [noise] which\nIs not really the hallmark of genius [noise]\nEnough [noise] so I had this group of friends and their lives all seem to get like better as time went on not in any like necessarily big flashy way but like their apartments got nicer as time went by their\nRelationships got stronger as life went by their jobs got better they got promoted they did more interesting things at the time went by I was like\nSort of living backwards as time went by my apartment got smaller than worse\nAnd as time went by my relationships\n[noise] and\nI thought well maybe I should find out what's up with these guys the one thing they all had in common and they talk to this guy named milk and\nSo I'm real sleuth like and I'm like I watched this for like another year\nAnd I'm like [noise] maybe I should talk to Milton\nCycle but it'd be weird if I talk to\nThem and they wouldn't be weird at all you know as you call them up you know get an appointment so great\nI call this guy up like an appointment on Fridays at six thirty\nSo great I go in I made him he he looks like you know sort of like a real southern gentleman from the other ... very very lanky he's tall um he's he's an older guy gray where students real like dapper dresser and so we start this this thing\nAnd I liked the fact that he's not a therapist you use the license social worker he's a counselor right which really fits with I sort of like nuts and bolts approach to this like\nI'm not going to be laying on of me you know fans were day bad like mumbling about luxury problems clearly so this is right up my alley so and he has he has this really sort of special sort of method you know it it largely involves making jokes about me\nSent a [noise] and and I kind of get the point through the humor and uh so you know I talked to him about\nThings I I go you know tell them you know whatever I'm going through like because I never knew how to say no for instance like I Would always just said yes so it's like you know if I'm Out to dinner with somebody that I don't I I can tell the trouble and they go on in a relationship and I guess you know\nMost [noise] even though I'm not nuts about being at dinner with you let's give this one to three years [noise] and you know it would be like what would you like this job for this salary and I think how the hell am I going to live on that\nIn New York City and I'd go like [noise] yes thank you very much you know that'll be fine um so I was telling me about this one time and he goes oh we'll have you ever read a thousand\nTimes no and I'm thinking oh God here comes the choosing self help book assignment right but I Want to be willing to get my life together and [noise]\nSo I'm like oh gosh you know I haven't\nRead that but I'm really willing to get a copy and\nI go I Will definitely by one I'm thinking like you know and um and he goes oh hang on I think I've got a copy on the other room and I'm like [noise]\nAll right great I'm so he comes back with an eight and a half by eleven sheet of paper and it just says no\nA thousand times so I mean it's like thought this was pretty funny and I kind of thought\nI think I like this dude like [noise] this is going to work\nI I told him I was telling them like something about a terrible week I'd had and I was like you know this isn't going great my job search blah blah blah blah blah and he goes how many beers did you have this week and I'm like well I mean I get what you're saying it wasn't a total right off\nLike if I got to have a beer you know like [noise] I get it [noise] dumping negative you know [noise] uh\nSo it was like well yeah that's true I did get to have some beers and there was like oh wait a minute\nAre you saying there's a link between my drinking and things not going well for [noise]\nAny leans back and he goes well your your part Irish or last names Kennedy and all your heroes are writers so let's just keep an eye on it [noise]\n\nYou know what you're saying there and er it planted the seeds you know his his humor is sort of like planted the seeds are right and I had been writing\nThings ah they were terrible they were as time went by\nViable things very short things on the Internet like I wrote a piece called um rejected a riddle by depressive\nYou know and what I Would have said to Sylvia Plath had I been her boyfriend\n[noise] gems like this ends but occasionally I get these emails from like junior editor is that\nPublishers and that was sort of tell him about that today and it's just like junior editor and publisher emailed me kind of made me feel like I'm doing something and he's like oh they're rolling out the red carpet for you [laughter]\nI'm like no that's not even you know forget it it's not even mentioned that [noise] but uh\nThe other sort of awkward thing is that\nWell two things really he taught me to cry sort of apropos with nothing and I found out a little awkward he was like you know sometimes when things get painful what I Do is I put on some sad music I get a towel or a handkerchief and I sit down on the couch and I let the feelings calm and then you move on and I was like [noise]\nJay like [noise] you know [noise] that's\nGreat for you I Will never be using that you know by the way um\nAnd he also had this weird thing with his humor he started getting into stand up comedy at age sixty five\nWhich made for a weird relationship sometimes because we like finish the session where you're talking about all this stuff and he would go like well you know I'm afraid we're out of time but if you've got five minutes I'd like to share this DVD of the set I did a Caroline's\nOn Tuesday [noise] I needed to literally\n[noise] ... let's say\nThere's nothing more I think such driving that to keep on trying things in the mail that NATO

bothered I oriented things in the sense\nThat I got the ball and not the bands that got the parents and I bought\nIn Ninety four I study to a I got the way and not the bank in Ninety four sets the one I got the tank but not that black [noise] well ... so terrible oh I thank you [noise]\nNobody and make him business is going to be [noise]\n\nA couple came in a couple of years ago that we will test

most intimate medium\nYou would think that video would provide\nMore because you could see the person looks like\nActually videos often distancing\nAudio just allows you to feel\nConnected to the person ... very\n\n\nUh\n[noise] had boxes working twelve feet above the sidewalk on beach wrote in vineyard haven\nIt's one of the busiest streets on Martha's Vineyard he surely Oprah was so against the real sound tired [noise]\nCatch sixty eight years old and looks like a marathon runner he's passing a road blocks to the front deck of a wouldn't vote\nIt's massive Seventy feet long and twenty four feet wide about the size of two tractor trailer side by side under its huge open air shed the kind of looks like a half built pirate ship work on the ...\nAt an age when lots of people retire had spent over Ninety five thousand dollars so far on the biggest and most ambitious project up his life and he's not even halfway done in fact the huge costs the boat is one reason some locals doubt Ted will ever finish it including the guy working at the gas station across the street\nOne time I went over and I said how many people are betting against this project and he laughed and said what are you kidding said all of them\nCatch vote is a replica of scout scouts were nineteenth century cargo ships basically like barges but with sales touching building votes off and on for over forty years so his choice to build a scout was personal he wanted a boat that could do real work but he also wanted to vote that would be a real pleasure\nThose guys were beautiful sailboat so this is when I don't know very agile she wrote a sea kindly shall addressed to carry a big loan\nThat isn't building the scout for self though he dreams about will become an outdoor adventure classroom for at risk kids even hopes to sail to the Carolinas with a student crew with a lower price bring it back to the vineyard\nIn selling some you know the new saw is that right [noise]\nBut there's a daunting amount of work to do before that happens in almost no money left to pay for it just started a nonprofit to raise funds he estimates he needs about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars more to finish\nDescribing his dream at a grant proposal isn't Ted strong suit Ted thinks some potential donors are holding off until they're sure that vote will be finished\nNo one wants to get involved with the nuts [laughter] to get involved with a fiasco but you know then showing up every day and you know something starts to merge\nLots of volunteers have shown up even if the money hasn't from the beginning Ted invited anyone interested in the boat to come work with him and says the boats just a couple of blocks from the ferry landing lots of visitors and volunteers have dropped in\nYou know some common every five dollars and the and the donation box how does this come you know when they give their good wishes and thousands and thousands of people with tons and tons of people would work on the boats\nTed's left alone to continue to work in the off season with just a few part-time volunteers to help the main year round volunteer for the last Eighteen months has been weaned sweetie\nWhat are you a most admirer respect about\nThe guts to do this\nOh sometimes it's overwhelming\nWhen you think about it how much work there is a much work we've gotten done and how much there is going to be done [noise]\nJoe's Big deal back from the boat and then you've got to carefully [noise] perfect just cut\nThe ... [noise]\nNo it's another big deal that friend he's\nWrestle one frame into place\nAnd then said would say we've got Seventy nine more to go\nFast paced keep uh keep it from what you do is you frame it out and then\nOh boy [noise]\nThe list goes on of course added to it the owner of the lot where the boat sits once it gone kids arranged for a contractor to move the boat to an uncovered location down the street but the decades and installed yeah that's the equivalent of a roof on a house and with no protection from the weather\nHeads work will be even harder so Ted box has little choice but to work on good days he loves it he's finishing the blocking on the front deck pushing hard to check off at least one goal of the day to keep up\nAnd if you don't stay on it like it was a sport\nEven with all the work ahead Ted says he's not about to let that happen\nNo um ... you up you're not from the media [noise]\nIn vineyard haven Massachusetts America Jones\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nI went down in the kind of a little\nArea and sat down and went to sleep next thing you know four o'clock in the morning [noise]\n[noise]\nNo I'm just you know practical high school or you're not really a lot about that but he bought one another engineer\nCame on and he brought me home for the next morning mother wasn't catch him I came downstairs from I ... did you hear me come home and just said no time to come home\nFour o'clock this morning and she said for\n[noise]\nSo I told her what happened and she said ... you're All right I said Oh yes I'm fine\nThat was a big deal in those days to have a mountain bike out the crown point jail\n... Mm servicers\n\nMm [noise]\nThe palace was above the pretty it's a theater we hadn't Garrett at that\nTime what was the actual bottom was up to the end of the red carpet or a dead nights carpet and the answer is that a lot of designs any the outside as Ed Markey do not like the Marquis was resemble the one for the call back in ... years ago and then the grand was right across the street in comparison to like a\nHuge covert trees would never driven through like a Volkswagen in the capital [noise]\n\nI've been living here in Nineteen forty five and my wife and I used to go there on Sunday that can do that the ... the church and he had to go to church do you go to the best you can\nDo it that time in the when they were children middles almost everything that the cartoon told no we didn't see the cartoons but it's a palette that was more of the the better the movies show that was more like the word Roger ... but they didn't show a lot of God was I don't think it's about back in there and there was more of a love story the more the\nTheater that he would bring it dates before then more than it would be just to come in and watch a movie it was all kind of like just as worried that you're going to get your big movement\nGoing it was a nice play yeah go and do you feel comfortable they did was it was a very nice place to attract you that down back then it was pretty it shows in town [noise]\nSo when you go in these buildings like how'd you get in and imagine that the front door and then just open it sound like you're inviting people to walk inside right well I Want to be careful\nAny building basically that I Can't just walk in as far as getting into the buildings in Gary Indiana [noise] I Would\nHave to honestly say that yeah most of them are wide open most of those buildings\nThere in such a state of disrepair that if there's not a window or a door there's almost\nGuaranteed to be a massive hall or some sort of other entrance we're basically just walking [noise]\n\nIt was a very bright day so the first thing you do when you walk in and says just pitch black and even the flashlights it takes a while for your eyes to adjust and I remember walking in and\nBasically standing at the stage side looking\nOut and as my eyes come into focus just massive hulk in\nYou know theater and looking from the stage angle look towards the seats and just realizing how how gigantic this place is gigantic and they just got it\nUh well I guess I've read to twenty five hundred to three thousand seeds of you know typical I guess of the large movie theaters of the day where they were just you know single balcony\nThat with a whole you know a large amount of the uh\nThe crowd and then the siege but the part that\nThat to me that made it look even larger was that just about all the seats have been torn out so you're seeing this big open space where\nYou know walking to the theater you got seeds you know you're kind of a\nNew kind of breaks up everything but just seeing that and wondering you know where did everything go get a lot of them are there but a lot of them are gone\nCivil what kind of shape and stuff in there or was it pretty\nAh unfortunately that theater it's pretty much destroyed\nAnd my thing and there's very little plaster work\nLeft the group has gaping holes in\nThe last few times that I've been there the whole just seem to be getting larger and larger all the wire framing for the plaster is bearer basically and coming down on its own I went up to the\nProjection booths the balconies and it's really\nLike I said just beyond saving my thing and it's just\nSo trashed there's no railing of the stairs are very dangerous I Would guess that from what I saw the way some of the materials are piled up to somebody was trying to salvage and possibly save some of the [noise] the plaster work there is a spot in the front lobby where he'd come in and buy your ticket\nWhere there is actually a sizeable chunk of the plaster still there and seeing how the colors and how it was painted and\nYou know seeing some little just a fraction of what it would have looked like you know while it was still an operation even though it would have been towards the end\nAnd they might have done some cheesier type of repairs are paying jobs just trying to\nGet an idea of what it would have looked like and what it would have been like to go there and you can see a show [noise]\n\nDo you think's going to get him give or take the million uh no I didn't there's really nothing to take from the palace theatre the thing I noticed the Gary's\nThere's really nothing to take from any of those buildings um they've been abandoned for so long that\nBasically everything significance been taken effect a good example that there is a hotel actually that encompasses the outside of the theater\nI think the second and third story and because the theater's it's such a state of disrepair you could walk through holes in a while to get into the hotel side or apartment building side\nEvery single door and there's just dozens and dozens of apartments [noise]\nAll the ... have been cut out I mean could tell somebody went in there and start 'em all out [noise] bigger pieces of you know mind stone carving or whatever\nPeople to help themselves to the church a city Methodist Church is a good example of that where there is just gigantic limestone\nAnd others that are just so huge people tried to get him out of the building they couldn't quite get him out the last\nMinute all the way you know type of a staircase or whatever [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWhat was the real reason the cost of health as well just ... just like water [noise] well um the downtown didn't have the business I guess and uh the uh all the theaters and they were down to one\nOr two in the palace was one of the last ones and then they remodeled it and uh\nIt had only had special shows I remember they had the Jackson Five there\nThat was a special show a long time ago the marketing stayed up for you on the marquee for years after that show because that was a live show live special show after the theater to close that they had remaining\nOpen it up and that was one of your shows than [noise] than than any model they started doing this and that didn't last too long because the downtown just what does try something new and and you couldn't help at all well they do downtown you see what it is only now compared to what it was then she's\nHere to go to the well but so much care to get the doors moved out to everybody went to the Mayor Bill the shopping malls you know they had moles outside in the city and everybody was going to the\nMalls and that's where that's where it was a because I'm a member of fellows I work with years ago Thursday nights and Monday Night the they knew their parents are going to take 'em downtown geared for shopping or ground point was the county seat McGarry was the center [noise]\n\n\nOn your in your injuring and I'm hearing [noise]\n\nThe reason they have the sign of this is Jackson Five tonight it's not like that's been around since the early seventies I actually came in the um the late Nineteen nineties been around for about eight or nine years is the Miss USA competition came to ... Donald Trump when you're on the casino though you also owns the rights to Miss USA pageants\nI which is kind of like the sun my poor cousin or Miss America pageant that was originally called the experiments and as part of the deal actually for Trump to get to see them I agreed to bring the pageant there for", "show_name": "PRX Remix", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "27"}
