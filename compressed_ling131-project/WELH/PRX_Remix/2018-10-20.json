R. acts perfect [laughter] perfect breath the delivery of pair [laughter] well that's how they do they do it\nHow long did you have to wait the last time you went to see her doctor was it longer than the tiny actually spent with the physician what is the only person you saw when you went to the doctor's office with the doctor there's a growing trend\nTaking your blood pressure to building your insurance Dr Chrissy ... has a micro practice in Portland, Oregon the first thing you notice when you come into our office is that there's really no waiting room there's an exam room and a space that looks a lot like a living room where Christie meets with her patients before and after their medical exam\nShe's an internist and pediatrician her patient call her doctor Chrissy she says the in formality is intentional\nPart of the philosophy behind having a more accessible approach to medicine is being more I'm more human more ... more accessible I'm In every way\nWhen you graduated from medical school what did you and vision in terms of of a job\nI envisioned and accepted a job in a multi specialty care center where I worked with probably over a hundred other physicians and had a very busy day of twenty plus patients each day had a panel of close to two thousand patients very quickly\nAnd that's a that's what many primary care doctors expect coming out is just sort of to jump on the treadmill and start running as fast as possible\nDuring the second year of my employment my first job after residency I met a woman named Pamela libel who was a family physician in Eugene Oregon\nAnd Pamela introduced me to this concept of micro practice and it immediately blew my mind and it was three months later that I opened the practice how was the transition how did that occur it was a phonetic\nTime so contacting insurance companies requesting a contract reviewing the contract filling them and with all of my degrees and board certifications and malpractice insurance data\nAnd all of that so it's just a lot of paperwork yeah that normally physicians don't ever see because all they do assigned the bottom line and and at a very helpful administrative person has gathered all of that for them\nIt seems like a short amount of time given all the stuff that you'd have to set up and you had to find a location and you know I even have to hire anybody but um but you didn't have to figure out how you were going to do all the all the jobs so to have in mind that location\nDesigned the space by medical equipment the office was a a fell into place I found it on Craig's list and it's half a mile from my home and it's in a quiet corner northeast Portland it's just I I Love my location is awesome\nHow does your colleagues react when you told them I'm leaving this practice and I'm going to start my own practice in this sort of unusual way\nIt's it's not spoken in medical training but there's this sort of um subliminal\nCurriculum that tells you you could never do with this on your own it's way too complex and\nWhat I felt and what I've verified is that it doesn't have to be\nI see fewer patients per day but for me it makes my practice more sustainable it keeps me in love with practicing medicine and keeps me engaged with my patients instead of looking past them or feeling rushed to complete a ten minute appointment so what is it typical day like for you I see my first patient at ten\nHas a two hour administrative break from twelve to one of those days per week I meet with my ministry of assistance who's relatively new addition and who works remotely\nUm and I see on average five to seven patients each day\nCan you could you walking through sort of a typical appointment like it it starts not waiting rooms All right\nNo waiting room because there's pretty much no waiting unless somebody arrived early to their appointment so I only see one patient or family in the office at a time and we sit down in a in an area that looks a lot like a living room they're sitting on a sofa I'm sitting in a chair\nAnd we might have tea I'm available for us to share while we're chatting about the reason for that\nA little bit we go into the examination room where I perform and physical exam and then we return to the sitting area and I write a prescription or order lab results or discuss the planned whatever it might be with them\nAnd so did you start out doing all of this by yourself you said now you've got an administrative person when you start out doing absolutely everything I started out doing absolutely everything with the exception of book keeping my partner does the bookkeeping for the business\nAnd that also gave us an opportunity to have a small group which allowed us to purchase our own health insurance\nAs a group rather than an as individuals and so what was it like the first year what did you think about going back\nI never thought about going back I really enjoyed this particular style of medicine if someone calls me in the middle of the night with\nA health related emergency I Know who they are now I have a sense of their medical history it's not one of two thousand it's one of four hundred something instead which is much more manageable\nHow long are you spending with each of your patients than new patient visit is usually sixty to Ninety minutes\nI'm a follow up visits is thirty to forty five minutes a well child check is forty five just sixty minutes in previous practices and in most practices it's a luxury to spend twenty minutes at a well child check\nAnd I understand from your website that you are not taking any new patients I I Do have the waitlist it's about six to nine months on average right now I Can't\nSee a lot of new people each week because that would interrupt the availability of same day an urgent need appointments for my existing patients but with this sort of moderated grove it's working really well do you sometimes wish that you could see more people\nI'm pretty happy with the pace of things as it is it's certainly not get rich quick schemes [laughter] I'm In fact I Would caution many physicians who might be ... that you will take a significant pay cut so who covers for you when you go on vacation\nI have a few colleagues in the area and the five of us sort of\nHelp each other out when we go on vacation in fact I was on call for Dr Hudson last week it's obvious how this is\nBetter for patients um tell me a little bit more about how it's better for you well I get to sleep in [laughter] that's a really wonderful part of my quality of life right now is that they don't have to get up at five thirty in the morning to be\nAt the office at seven to start seeing as many patients as possible all day long the hours are a blessing to me\nAnd again the intimacy with my patients and how well I get to know these families\nReally makes my job a pleasure and sustains my interest in love of medicine are there are there downsides for you I think that the downside potentially is isolation that I don't have a colleague in the office next door\nTo say hey what do you think about this case or can you can look at this raft with me what do you think about this which I Do miss you said that that that this is kind of reflective of your personality is that is that on your end I've been told that I started saying that I wanted to do it all by myself\nAround age two and never stop much [laughter]\nSo it really clearly suits me very well\nWhoa\nThat's Dr Christie I she has a micro practice in Portland, Oregon we have some links to more information about this unique approach to Madison on our website destination the I got one\n\nLoses ... remarried [noise] for no more ... for the amazing world [noise]\nDot org [noise]\nThis is how sound the backstory to

help\nJohn be when has reported on race for much of his career but events in two thousand six\nTeam got him thinking thinking about reporting on race with a slightly different framework first John attended an anti racism workshop in January of two thousand six team for two days he was immersed in discussions about race and racism\nThen there were all the race related events of that year racial injustice police incidents the presidential race John saw all these events laid bare issues of race and racism in the U.S here's an excerpt from Johns podcast scene on radio\nDo I need to list them\nFrom the many police shootings of unarmed black people to the massacre of nine black churchgoers by the white supremacist terrorists Dylann Roof\nDo cultural stuff like the Oscars so white\nOn China now otherwise known as the white people's choice award [noise]\nAnd what feels like a relentless drip drip month by month of glimpses into\nThe everyday of American Life moments not meant for public consumption that captured on smartphones and sent Rick ... around the Internet [noise] the man handling of black teenage girls by white cops in school cops this college kids in Oklahoma\nOf what a wonderful country we are the people who look like us made and um so it's not easy to just to see outside that that dream of that bubble if you will to use another metaphor\nJohn says you can hear that bubble in a lot of reporting he says just listen for how people are identified\nAnd noticed that a lot of times in in our reporting we will mention that someone is black or Latino or Asian or Native American if they are but white people we we we don't with that's just a person\nYou know we said Joe schmo is a plumber who lives in this town in Ohio now if if that person's black it's for one thing it's very likely going to be part of the story that they are black\nBut we don't do that with white people and that's a this is one of the things that people who think more deeply about whiteness point out is that they call it unmarked this\nOr that whiteness is sort of treated as the default it's the that you're just a person if you're white and then and and it's non white people who have race\nSo John we'll flip that on ... on its head\nThe next ten episodes obscene on radio will be all about the white race and white is no on ... ...\nIt's a critical look at white dominated society with stories about the origins of race a town that has forgotten the racial cleansing that took place there and northern innocence the idea among whites in the northern us but the south has more to answer for\n[noise] I Am really looking forward to the whole series again it's called seeing white it's part of the podcast scene on radio and seen by the way is spelled F.

to like you said he spent long nights teaching himself everything about nice making surrounded by machines and tools in his basement it would've been easy for George to lose track of the outside world but it turned out he wasn't often alone he had his girlfriend Helen\nHelen when we first met and she would come over and she would\nReally get into it and she would help me\nShe would polish the nice for me you know whatever she could do geology ... wanted to help but I Would do just bringing down the stairs put a wheelchair there would be so Sam paper and everything she would just go to town we got along\nWe started talking and started being friends it's like the way I dance the number of things [laughter] so\nA wider over for a support one time and I don't think she ever left after that

you want it so that was used my soul mate\nAfter Helen died judge designed to nice in her honor you figured out a way to incorporate her ashes into this deal the blade\nJust labeled can one ashes what I Would move out of carbon\nWhat do you put in the steel to make it harder hobby plus I got the media right the grind up and put in there also so she'll be undersized too but it's something that would be my by my side with Hellmann's ashes and so\nI knew she will love that because she always used to do some ... ... my work she used to be the quality control manager\nAnd she always looked at over

of the nice to handle will be award hot task to represent ... takes him that the diamonds from her and gage meaning next to engraving of her name George has already forged this deal with on the ashes in it\nBut it isn't a nice yet there's still a lot more work to do before it's complete in the past George can make a nice in two weeks from start to finish but it's been two years since you started Holland's nice\nJust have to assemble it meant books that I haven't been very aggressive and the second my knife business ever since my lady diet just haven't haven't got back into doing and if the\nGeorge finish it sounds nice he says it's not something he'll carry around it's too fast\nHelen steal to make another nice something simple in the knife world it would be called an everyday carry it would be plain functional just like it sounds it something you carry every day the thing is George doesn't sound certain health finish any of these nice\nIn the meantime the one thing judge does carry every day it's his grief\nIt might seem like he's lost momentum but making steel can be a tricky process and needs to be called slowly to become flexible and strong so like any good nice maker George is being patient he's just giving the steel some time\nFor WC I it's creative life I'm Erika Kramer\nListening to remove Israel most of your book where you sort of disappointed in the public

past she transforms those smells into perfumes her line is called Antonio's flowers and each perfume is associated with memories or experiences from her life like her grandmother's garden or days by the sea\nBut how on earth do you turn a memory or the smell of a memory into a perfume well it begins with flowers and tonia discovered her passion for sent in her flower shop when she realized set her favorite thing about flowers wasn't really the flowers\nI mean I sometimes I'd have just almost on sellable lilies there were all blown open already but the smells so good that you know like that I Would buy them and then it's like wow this is really what I Love about flowers\nForeign tonia smell is key but the funny thing is she didn't even wear perfume at that point\nAnd when I went to look
