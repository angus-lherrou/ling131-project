lift me yet so one stood above me and dragged me a while one sheds to me from behind I started feeling faint dizzy queasy queen\nOnce when I was about to break into tears Thomas tap my arm and pointed up the mountain they're way above me on a ledge no bigger than inch from my point of view a giant silver back screened it as smashing a tree limbs over and over onto the ground [noise]\n\nThe inside

Peter ... out here are the guys\nWe've got one more story for you today and it's about one of history's most famous attempts to deliver the mail the Pony Express now just to be clear the Pony Express was not a service of the United states post office itself it was a private venture like fed ex or UPS\nAnd at the time it was seen as a huge achievement moving the male across the country on horseback in just ten days people were fascinated by the pony and the legend lives on today but as you might have guessed the Pony Express was not as glamorous as a missed the Jess\nNext door producer ...

mom a in\nThe interest of full disclosure my mom has no formal training in American history most of what she knows about the Pony Express comes from stories stories she heard from someone who heard

ducks walking around in freezing temperatures and wondered how they keep their feet from freezing the ducks seem oblivious to the cold\nIt was or perhaps even concern that the tiny feet of songbird

and amazing adaptation\nCalled ... is responsible [noise] the arteries the transport blood into the legs lion contract with the things that returned blood to the birds heart\nThe warm arteries keep the cooler veins because the veins also cool the arteries the birds feet are closer to environmental temperature and those don't lose as much heat as they would if they were at body temperature\n\nAnd

recorded back in Nineteen sixty six by a teenager from suburban Chicago\nA few people heard it back then but now almost fifty years later Michael Eisner has dusted off and he's going to take us back to that day on the Southside of Chicago when he got the interview of a lifetime\n...\nI was probably nine years old when I first realized how much I loved radio when I was ten eleven twelve years old I Would go down to Chicago and watch the real D jays work down at the big Chicago radio stations and then I had an opportunity to get into new for high school and we're not going away\nAnd they had a radio station there and we called up out of nowhere celebrities that were in town in Chicago and then I decided that I needed to start burying down and some of my heroes and one of them of course was Cassius Clay Muhammad Ali\nFellow who's Mohammed Ali the heavyweight champion of the world that will be speaking to you who own that'd be in teen age eighty eight point and one of them and when that ah [noise]\n\nOkay so we're Seventeen years old or sitting in the office nervous waiting for this guy to arrive and Ali screech is up in his red cattle\nTwenty four years old hops over Disney open the door hops over and comes in the office and this girl comes in sits on his lap she must have been Eighteen Nineteen years old and she starts doing his wrists and it is this bizarre scenario that he created\nThe in going to Mars and fighting the champion up on march\n[noise] and I don't have the tape recorder and I said the and chanting can you think you can do that again\nThat would be several satellites circling the United states wants them to fight here we have to stop at about ten space stations on the way we estimate our time and getting lab and about ten years Nineteen teens Seventy six\nI'll be ten years old but I Will still be in good shape I expect the fight to go about twelve sack of heightened the green job up there may believe sick I'll walk up and after mocking him out I Hope to be back on earth had about Nineteen eighty six\nYou know I haven't this microphone in front of this guy who is one of the most famous people on earth and we start to ask him questions\nOkay Mohammed Ali or how did you first become interested in is laughing\nWhen I started by twelve years ago someone stole my bicycle and I said I Want to learn how to fight so I can catch him and beat him up but I never did catch in London and up to a challenge for the whole world answering while you were an amateur did you have a desire to become a professional ... you know I didn't\nEither start out as an amateur but um [noise] I didn't know that I Would end up to try and put it after winning all the amateur titles Cindy Kang ... afraid dawned on me that I had a chance to Vietnam professional\nIs there any particular um boxes that you really idolize before you became a pro sugary Robison lots of my idol and he's still a lot of things the greatest of all times\nYou more or less trying to have

that's a risk in there quicker shut the title because of the talking before the fight you think you had an edge over your opponent mentally or a little more thought it was crazy and they were frightened of any of the fighting\nIs helping to ally [noise] did you expect a tougher fight from Patterson listed on there that it wasn't terribly last that long because I Want to do that way the way

universal title thank you\n[noise] I asked Michael what it's like to go back in time and listen to this kid this younger version of himself interviewing one of the most famous people in the world she said there are of course all kinds of things he wished he would have asked but he really only has one regret\nYou know I guess if I have any regrets at all is that I didn't get them somehow spin has come out\n[laughter] [noise] during the interview\nNow we have also created an animated video version of this rare interview with Mohammed Ali it was produced in collaboration with story board

reported and produce like Jennifer ...\nEach week on science radio show and podcast big picture science hosts that shot stuck in Mali Bentley connect ideas about the origin future and behavior of life in technology and surprising and playful ways astrobiologist David Greene spoon makes the case for life on Venus starting with why it probably doesn't exist on the surface\nIn Fahrenheit terms it's close to nine hundred degrees every day all day day night north south the only way you can get a little bit cooler than that on Venus is to go up to the top of one of the high mountains but that that doesn't buy you much it's it's pretty darn hot everywhere and being us on the surface\nOkay so even aside from considerations of you know the lack of lack of water no oceans know rivers no legs the fact that the atmospheres all this carbon dioxide and so what you mean aside from all that it looks like it's dead Jim me because any life would just be boiled away but you have another idea\nWell I think first of all and astrobiology we have to really keep a pretty open mind about\nThe question of habit ability because\nOur notions are so heavily biased towards our one planet so we have to be open to ideas that seemed like there are a little bit out of left field is as long as they're not so far out that that we're we're just chasing fairy tales but an interesting thing about Venus is that it has this card deck\nAbout thirty miles up from the surface that is composed of liquid water granted liquid water in an intense acidic solution but yet there is a liquid medium and there are other properties of that called deck that just conceivably I think could be conducive to life\nAnd so what you're suggesting is that Venus could have some sort of floating organisms\nYeah ... I don't see any reason why there couldn't be something analogous to bacteria that could live in ... droplets on Venus there's a liquid medium their energy sources there seemed to be nutrients and there are even some strange chemical\nProperties of that region of the atmosphere that could be interpreted as somewhat conducive to some kind of life\nSo these are not big birds these are not atmosphere elephants these would be microbes floating thirty miles up in the ... atmosphere now you say there's some interesting compounds up there but really how did these guys make a living I mean are they doing it by a photosynthesis or they just eating\nTheir metabolism whether a couple of possibilities photosynthesis is a possibility there is actually a fair amount of solar radiation up into Venus cloud decks in fact if there was something up there that could take advantage of ultraviolet light\nNot a trick that we've seen on earth but a trick one might imagine that life somewhere in the universe could have mastered than there there's quite a bit of energy\nThe other possibility is that they are taking in some kind of chemical energy there are some interesting cycles in the atmosphere Venus involving volcanoes on the surface them sulfur gases in the atmosphere and transitions between energetic molecules and what we called ... equilibrium where there is sort of\nEnergetic potential in the mix of chemicals and those are the kinds of things on earth that life takes advantage of and if you don't look for the same specific metabolism that we have on earth but look for that general property of a chemical cycle\nThat could be exploited by organisms then you actually can come up with some examples on Venus of juicy chemicals that you could imagine could be eaten digested and used to extract energy by organisms\nWell as long as we're talking about the theoretical possibility of life there I'll ask you to speculate a little bit farther would this life had been descended from\nLife left over from those very early days of Venus when we think that it was a lot more like the earth when it might have had surface oceans and and these are the remnants of an ancient venues in population of biology\nI think it's possible when Venus whether young planet it probably had oceans and in fact there was probably a time when Venus earth and Mars all had oceans and may even have been exchanging life between them\nSo there could have been in origin of life on Venus Venus could have been infected if you will with microbes from earth or Mars so if our current understanding of what it takes for a biosphere is correct\nThen there's every reason to believe that Venus could have had an early biosphere and then the question is what happened to it when the oceans went away\nAnd life being so adaptable and sort of crafty at following the changes that have planted in finding nature's as it has done many times in the history of the earth\nOne at least ten wonder if it might have found a way to migrate to the upper atmosphere niche which still has some of those qualities of what we consider to be a habitable environment\nDavid how could we possibly find these things I mean if if you could somehow control the NASA Budget for the next Twenty years or how would you look for life on Venus", "show_name": "PRX Remix", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
