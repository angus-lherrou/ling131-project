bars if you're a truffle confused [noise] you've got to the right place\nWe're going to take a closer look at three very real situations overcrowding us to nominate end an earthquake and find out if those disasters could bring down the Golden Gate bridge\nMy name is yeah how sad is that I'm a professor of structural engineering and bridge engineering at UC Berkeley turns out that's Donna is ...\nEngineer for over forty years\nGod Forbid we don't want anything humans relate to the collapse of the Golden Gate bridge is just one of the best bridges in the world but no question as both Christians so we are in this business to provide you with that says\nLet's start with the overcrowding\nWhen the Golden Gate bridge open back in Nineteen thirty seven fifty thousand people walked on to check it out no problem but in Nineteen eighty seven when the bridge turned fifty three hundred thousand pedestrians crowded on now picture of the bridge the roadway generally curves up towards the middle\nWell on that day the bridge actually flatten losing its curved shape astonished says the load stretched the cables\nThe cable is the weakest link\nOr among the roadway and then the towers so if anything's going to go first as good as men can but\nHe says it wasn't actually dangerous\nBecause up to the other ... people being on the bridge the stresses and the bridge rich for the scent of capacity under oath noted load up bridge which uh which was cars and trucks this this isn't the bridge or twenty five percent\nSo how many people would it take to collapse the bridge where did the calculation to see what happens after crunching the numbers astonished found it would take this many people to bring it down\nNine hundred thousand people so you have to get the whole population of the San Francisco a perhaps suburbs are under a bridge to have the cable [noise]\nJust how would you fit nine hundred thousand people onto the bridge\nFor each ... square foot of that one square foot of area should hold one on the half person [noise]\nUnless you stack them so if you're\nAbout something else that I was\nSitting on the shoulder [noise] it was a run on a person per square foot [noise]\nAnd even with a double layer of people astonished says you'd have to forcibly shove everyone onto the bridge to maximize space [noise]\nDefinitely strange they do it and the time the tracks the people who push people inside the that's it so you have to do the same [noise]\nSo overcrowding is pretty unlikely\nBut what about us to nominate maybe the destruction these giant waves recently caused across the Pacific also give us reason to be nervous 'cause the Golden Gate bridge survive a massive wall of water crashing into\nA sauna says to figure out what kind of damage ... he would do to your structure you have to know the waves speed and the waves hiked\nIn order to have you know hard to tell others that comes in with like twenty five miles per hour speed and ... of Golden Gate bridge you have to have to hide the foo foo about three hundred\nThousand possible it's impossible to and his mom and ditching the bruise that probably has more than even fifty feet\nThat is because we don't have the type of underwater falls off our coastline that caused ... even if we did the biggest earthquake cause tsunamis on record was two hundred feet tall but according to us Donna even that's not high enough to topple the Golden Gate bridge\nIf you don't have enough water that you can be toppled the ... it has to be up to your mic that's a symptom of Golden Gate bridge but but the Golden Gate bridge Nick is pretty hot ...\n[noise]\nBut but what about an earthquake well that's one of ... it's not like people on the bridge rose nominees\nAstonished says the towers of the bridge are so heavy the original engineers didn't bold them to their foundation\nFor when there was good comes to the top of them and get rid of him actually up [noise]\nThat sounds scary and astonished says British officials decided to make sure it doesn't happen after the Loma Prieta earthquake back in Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\n\nIt famously happens during the world series\n[noise]\nMore magnitude six point nine the Golden Gate bridge suffered only minor damage but bigger earthquakes can happen here the largest earthquake\nThat Saddam just falls congenital it is it's foreign to\nUs Donald was tapped to be on the Golden Gate bridge is a seismic retrofit team and make the bridge safe and an eight point three\nCalls Mrs with us to know to the best of all knowledge is going to prevent she just damage to the bridge [noise]\nThe retrofit which includes things like strengthening the basis so they don't get crushed will be done in two to four years [noise]\nAstonished says the answer is he came up with well mostly hypothetical proved what he already knew\nI'm very happy to listen to those that we are very proud those engineers that we have such structures are the public use them in ... at the same time there are so safe that we should you asking me to look into this exciting weekend for [laughter]\nSo fear not bay area residents the Golden Gate bridge probably isn't coming down anytime
