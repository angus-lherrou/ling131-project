the other ... very very lanky he's tall um he's he's an older guy gray worst suits real like dapper dresser\nAnd so we start this this thing\nAnd I like the fact that he's not a therapist you use the

luxury problems clearly so this is right up my alley so any hasn't yet isn't really sort of special sort of method you know it it largely in balls making jokes about me\nSense uh [noise] and and I

instance like I Would always just said yes so it's like you know if I'm Out to dinner with somebody that I don't I I can tell us trouble and they have been a relationship and I guess you know\n[noise]

runner he's passing a road blocks to the front deck of a wooden boat it's massive Seventy feet long and twenty four feet wide about the size of two tractor trailer side by side under its huge open air shed the kind of looks like a half built pirate ship work on the snow\nAt an age when lots of people retire had spent over Ninety five thousand dollars so far on the biggest and most ambitious project up his life and he's not even halfway done in fact the huge costs the boat is one reason some locals doubt Ted will ever finish it including the guy working at the gas station across the street\nOne time I went over and I said how many people are betting against this project and he laughed and said what are you kidding said all of them ...\n... it's a replica of scale scouts were nineteenth century cargo ships basically like barges but with sales touching building votes off and on for over forty years so his choice to build a scout was personal he wanted a boat that could do real work but he also wanted to vote that would be a real pleasure\nThere was ... that were beautiful sailboat since we don't know very agile see where they see primarily shuttle draft and carry Big Love\nThat isn't building the scout for himself so he dreams about will become an outdoor adventure classrooms for at risk kids even hopes to sail to the Carolinas with a student crew where the load up price bring it back to the vineyard in selling\nSome you know the new saw is that right [noise]\nBut there's a daunting amount of work to do before that happens in almost no money left to pay for it just started a nonprofit to raise funds he estimates he needs about a hundred and thirty thousand dollars more to finish\nDescribing his dream and the grant proposal isn't Ted strong suit catching some potential donors are holding off until they're sure that vote will be finished\nNo one wants to get involved with the nuts [laughter]\nThan showing up every day and you know something starts to emerge\nLots of volunteers have shown up even if the money hasn't from the beginning that invited anyone interested in the boat to come work with him and says the boats just a couple of blocks from the ferry landing lots of visitors and volunteers have dropped in\nYou know some common every five dollars and the and the donation box I was just come you know when they give it a good wishes and thousands and thousands of people who've come and hundreds of people who works on the boat\nBut most volunteers move on at the end of the summer\nTed's left alone to continue to work in the off season with just a few part-time volunteers to help the main year round volunteer for the last Eighteen months has been weaned sweetie\nWhat are you a most admirer respect about\nThe guts to do this oh sometimes it's overwhelming\nWhen you think about it how much work there is a much work we've gotten done and how much there is still to be done [noise]\nJoe's Big deal the backbone of the vote then you've got to carefully [laughter] perfect the crux of\nThe curve in the ... [noise]\nNo it's not a big deal getting your friend he's he's\nRussell one frame in place\nSince Edward say All right we've got Seventy nine more to go\nFast paced keep uh keep it from what you do you frame it up and then\nOh boy [noise]\nThe list goes on of course added to it the owner of the lot where the boat sits once it gone kids arrange for a contractor to move the boat to an uncovered location down the street\nBut the decades and installed yet that's the equivalent of a roof on a house and with no protection from the weather heads work will be even harder so Ted box has little choice but to work on good days he loves it he's finishing the blocking on the front deck pushing hard to check off at least one goal of the day to keep up\nAnd if you don't stay on it like it was a sport\nEven with all the work ahead Ted says he's not about to let that happen\nNo um ... you up you're not going to be a [noise]\nIn vineyard haven Massachusetts America Jones\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nI went down in the kind of level\nArea and sat down and went to sleep and the next thing I was four o'clock in the morning [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nNow I'm just you know practical high school or you're not really a lot about that but he ... and other engineer came on and he brought\nMe home for the next morning mother was in the kitchen when I came downstairs and I did you hear me come home she said no time to come home\nFour o'clock this morning and she said for\n\nSo I told her what happened and she said well you're All right I said oh yeah that sounds fine\nThat was a big deal in those days to mountain bike out the ... ...\n... Mm servicers\nMm [noise]\nMm [noise]\nThe palaces above the prettiest a theater we hadn't Garrett at that time\nWas nicer about it was a well the end of the red carpet or a dead nights carpet and the answer is that a lot of designs any the outside air that Markey noted not unlike the Marquis was resemble the one for the call back in two years ago and then the ground was right across the street in comparison to like\nYou would never went there but it's like a vote in the capital\n[noise]\nAh I've been living here in Nineteen forty five and my wife and I used to go there on Sundays that can do that we did the church and he had to go to church do you go to the best you can look\nAt that time in the when they were children middles almost every city that cartoon told me no we didn't see the cartoon as much as a palette that was more the better the movies show almost more like Roy Rogers but they didn't show a lot of God would I don't think it's about back in it and it was more of a love story the more the\nSkills of theater that he would bring it dates for then more than it would be just a dare come in and watch a movie it was all kind of like just a word that you're going to get your big movie go it\nWas a nice place to go and do you feel comfortable yeah they did was it was a very nice place\nPretty shows in [noise]\n\n\nSo when you go in these buildings like how'd you get in and imagine the front door and then just like lighting people walking side right\nWell I Want to be careful how I raised this I don't go into any\nBuilding basically that I Can't just walk in as far as getting into the buildings in Gary Indiana [noise] I Would\nHave honestly say that yeah most of them are wide open most of those buildings\nAre in such a state of disrepair that if there's not a window or a door there's almost\nGuaranteed to be a massive hall or some sort of other entrance we're basically just walk yeah [noise]\n\nIt was a very bright day so the first thing you do when you walk in and says just pitch black and even the flashlights it takes a while for your eyes to adjust and I remember walking in and\nBasically standing at the stage side looking out\nAnd as my eyes come into focus just massive hokey and\nYou know theater and looking from the stage angle look towards the seats and just realizing how how gigantic this place is how gigantic as they can you just got it\nUh well I guess I've read to twenty five hundred to three thousand seeds of you know typical I guess of the large movie theaters of the day where they were just you know single balcony\nThat would hold you know large amount of the uh\nThe crowd and then the siege but the part that\nTo me that made it look even larger was that just about all the seats have been torn out so you're seeing this big open space\nWhere you know you walk into a theater you got to see you know you're kind of a\nKind of breaks up everything but just seeing that and wondering you know where did everything go get a lot of them are there but a lot of them are gone [noise]\nCivil what kind of shape and stuff like that hadn't been well preserved or was it not\nA unfortunately that theater it's pretty much destroyed and my thing and there's very little\nPlaster work lost a roof has gaping holes in the last\nFew times that I had been there the whole just seem to be getting larger and larger all the\nWire framing for the plaster is bear basically and coming down on its own I went up to the\nProjection booths the balconies and it's really\nLike I said just beyond saving my thing\nAnd it's just so trashed there's no railing of the stairs are very dangerous\nI Would guess that from what I saw the way some of the materials are piled up to somebody was trying to salvage and possibly save some of the [noise] the plaster work there is a spot in the front lobby you know where you come in and buy your ticket\nWhere there is actually a sizeable chunk of the plaster still there and seeing how the colors and how it was painted and\nYou know seeing some little just a fraction of what it would have looked like you know while it was still an operation even though it would have been towards the end and they might have done some\nCheesier type of repairs or paint jobs just trying to\nGet an idea of what it would have looked like and what it would have been like to go there and to see a show [noise]\n\nDid you take anything really didn't give or take the million or no I didn't there's really nothing to take from the palace theatre the thing I noticed in the areas\nThere's really nothing to take from enables building um they've been abandoned for so long that\nBasically everything significance been taken effect a good example but there is a hotel\nI think the second and third story because the theaters such a state of disrepair you can walk all over the walls going to the hotel fighter apartment that every single door and there's just thousands and thousands of apartment [noise]\nAll the ... that's been cut out I mean could tell somebody would have never thought 'em all out bigger pieces of you know mind stone carving or whatever people to help themselves [noise]\nUh the church a city Methodist Church is a good example of that where they were just gigantic lines don't ... see where a lot of them been taken\nAnd others that are just so huge people tried to get him out of the building they couldn't quite get them out lots of them you know in the middle of\nA hallway or you know type of a staircase or whatever [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWhat was the real reason I called something else that\nWas about ... just ... water [noise] Mm well um the downtown didn't have the business I guess and uh the uh all the theaters and they were down to one or two and then the palace was one of the last ones\nAnd then they remodeled it and\nIt had only had special shows I remember they had the Jackson Five there\nThat was a special show a long time ago the marquee stayed up for you on the market for years that does that show because that was a live show live special show after the theater to close that they had remind me open it up and that was one of these shows and\nThen [noise] then\nAfter they remodeled the joke that didn't last too long because the downtown just what does try something new and it couldn't help at all well they do downtown you see what it is only now compared to what it was\nThen she was scared to go down well with so much scared at just the doors moved out everybody when Mayor Bill the shopping malls you know they had moles outside in the city and everybody was going to the\nMalls and that's where that's where it was um because I'm a member of fellows I work with years ago Thursday nights and Monday Night the they knew their parents were going to take 'em downtown Garrett was shopping a ground\nPoint was the county's McGarry was the center [noise]\n\n\nYou're in you're injuring I'm hearing [noise]\n\nThe reason they have the sign of this is Jackson
