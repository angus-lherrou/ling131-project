window with a reading from Janice Kramer here's Jen is to help set things up if you marry me I Will buy you a computer and take you to see the world\nThat's Gerry proposed to Janice I'm On I think my seventh or eighth computer now and they've been traveling the world ever since their first expedition was to a mountain in Rwanda to seek RLS Dian Fossey's gorillas because we both love girls\n[noise] [noise] the snow was so he told us to make [noise]\nIt was a pretty ambitious track Janis was fifty three years old and I was kinda overweight put it nicely and on the other side of the mountain\nWar was raging comes out so we got in the back of these pickup trucks\nWith all these gorillas and I mean not boil animals that Google was these guys with machine\nYes and four strapped across their shoulders there was I Would say probably one guard for each one of us that went on to climb because of the violence Jerry engine is were given a visa for one day only they had from sunrise to sunset\nTo find what they had come all the way from Oklahoma looking for [noise]\nHere's Jen is reading from her my sinus [noise]\n\nOh\nAs we gather to begin the ascent to track arrest if any of us needed a reporter and he looked directly at me\nThe overweight fifty three year old American Woman oh\nYes I said thinking it would be nice to have someone carry my backpack for me one or two he asked me okay too I great thinking Jerry would probably like someone to carry is definitely too little did I Know that Thomas and Greg would be carrying me and none of my backpack have them mountains on ... when\n\nWe started up to pass a long line of those two drivers in the front three or four military guards behind them dream or triggers a couple of more guards Jerry me and my poor teachers\nMore guards another tracker behind as it was an hour's high just to the top of the farming tears this was not it healed but it's sixty five degrees slow my the look on their faces I knew Thomas and Greg ... there were was cut out for them\nFinally we made it to the park Deval can that's where the real tracking began [noise]\n\nThe jungle was dance just touching or brushing an adult would set my fingers on science\n[noise] up up up more and more the tracker was hacking his way through the jungle with his machete\nThe ground underneath us was peat moss sometimes flip ... my thighs were so weak I could barely lifts and Eighteen Inches to another fish hope Indian patients in the mid or rocks and the steps were too steep or to slavery Greg and Thomas would put their arms underneath my armpits\nIn other areas torture we made it to where's this was group had ness did the night before now sue so was the last baby born before Dian Fossey died he was her little favorite\nThe smell was overpowering awhile mesquite since it was a big area with lots of giant ness fashion from leave\n\nUp up up more and more the trail was to narrow down for Greg and Thomas to live to me yet so one stood above me and dragged me a while one sheds to me from behind\nI started feeling faint dizzy queasy queasy or\nOoh\nOnce when I was about to break into tears Thomas Tamm my arm and pointed up the mountain they're way above me on a ledge no bigger than inch from my point of view a giant silver back screened it as smashing a tree lame over and over onto the ground [noise]\n\nThe inside of his mouth was the spot of read in a mountainous than we kept climbing [noise]\n\nDetractors thirty yards the head of as pointed to as they get their hear [noise] all around the gorillas eight ... mumbled to each other forwarded [noise] behind me and met her in her youngster will quietly eating [noise]\nWe ... a bit to the left and they're lying in the ... giant silver bad chewing on sticks to track\nOr an edge may I turned to my ride and he pulled the phone which back like a hurting [noise]\nNot more than six feet from me set a giant flattened back I grabbed my cameras snapped a shot it sounded as being made the black patch turning stare at me the camera flash\nI guess the tractor gas the women beside me gas the gorilla slapped his eyes I hunkered down trying to be small time they used to track are warned\nThe black back collect rate at Institute directly over me [noise] been charged behind you crash through the trees disappearing into the jungle\n[noise]\n\nThe trip down was pretty wild at some point so I basically just started rolling [noise]\nAt the bottom I reached into my many belt and gave Thomas and Greg Fifteen dollars age which is like a month salary for them and then I had been even though they were embarrassed why should they be embarrassed there were only a few parts of my body they hadn't both types that unforgettable that [noise]\nI almost died that day

remakes [noise]\nTo find peace comes from back story with the American history guys each week back story takes a topic say birth disease or college sports and explores the history of that topic in America historians Brian ... at ... and Peter on his hosts the show here of the guys\nWe've got one more story for you today and it's about one of history's most famous attempts to deliver the mail the Pony Express now just to be clear the Pony Express was not a service of the United states post office itself it was a private venture like fed ex or UPS\nAnd at the time it was seen as a huge achievement moving the male across the country on horse back in just ten days people were fascinated by the pony and the legend lives on today but\nAs you might have guessed the Pony Express was not as glamorous as a missed suggests extort producer ... mental tells the story\nI grew up hearing the same story you did about the Pony Express but as it's not exactly a topic of everyday conversation I called up my childhood experts source for refresher\nAim 'em hey a in\nThe interest of full disclosure my mom has no formal training in American history most of what she knows about the Pony Express comes from stories stories she heard from someone who heard them from someone who heard them from someone I asked her what exactly she remembers\nThat was the eldest up while giving like eight or anything I think like early ... I like it was like they would have like the way across\nHave you ever watch ducks walking around in freezing temperatures and wondered how they keep their feet from freezing the ducks seem oblivious to the cold even as they stand on ice covered lakes and streams or perhaps even concern that the tiny feet of songbird will freeze to metal purchase\n\nUnlike our feet birds feet are little more than bones scene you and scale with very few nerves but it takes more than a lack of nerves to keep their feet from freezing and amazing adaptation\nCalled ... is responsible [noise] the arteries the transport blood into the legs lion contact with the things that returned blood to the birds heart\nThe warm arteries heat the cooler veins because the veins also cool the arteries the birds feet are closer to environmental temperature and those don't lose as much heat as they would if they were at body temperature\n\nAnd those little songbirds feet dory burns feet lack sweat glands and stay dry so there's no danger of them freezing to middle purchase\n\nWhat was that called again ... ... for ... not on Michael Stein support\nFor bird now comes from songbird coffee offering bird friendly organic shade grown coffee for holiday giving more at bird notes dot org slash songbird\n... the language that\nYour heart and here's one of them there and the genetic predisposition that we'd have to narrow it down\nWere aiming at all in order to to really make me stories thing\nWe're aiming at the heart from one heart into another oh this is the sound of your eggs and this is public radio ...\n...\n[noise]\nThis is Mohammed Ali may heavyweight champion of the world now at the laws they don't get Kevin on the way to live by but part of the universe full title\n[noise] visit bike I'm like I'm David Guerra lock and in this edition of vintage interview with Mohammed Ali that we've just uncovered it was recorded back in Nineteen sixty six by a teenager from suburban Chicago a few people heard it back then but now almost fifty years later\nMichael Eisner has dusted it off and he's going to take us back to that day on the Southside of Chicago when he got the interview of a lifetime\n...\nI was probably nine years old when I first realized how much I Love radio when I was ten eleven twelve years old I Would go down to Chicago and watch the real D jays work down at the big Chicago radio stations than I had an opportunity to get into neutral\nAnd we called up out of nowhere celebrities that were in town and Chicago and then I decided that I needed to start burying down and some of my heroes and one of them of course was Cassius Clay Muhammad Ali\nHello this is Mohammed Ali the heavyweight champion of the world that will be speaking to you soon own W. N. T. H. eighty eight point one of them and will not go [noise]\n\nOkay so we're Seventeen years old or sitting in the office and nervous waiting for this guy to arrive\nAnd Ali screech is up in his red and Cadillac convertible right in front of a fire plug twenty four years old hops over Disney open the door hops over and comes in the office and this girl comes in sits on his lap she must have been Eighteen Nineteen years old\nAnd she starts doing his wrists\nAnd then there's this bizarre scenario that he created of him going to Mars and fighting the champion up on march\n[noise] and I don't have a tape recorder\nI said the and chanting can you think you can do that again\nThat would be seven satellite circling the United states wants them to fight here we have to stop at about ten space stations on the way we ask that made our time and getting that got about ten years Nineteen teens Seventy six I Will be ten years old but I Will still be in good shape\nI expect the fight to go about twelve set of them tightened the green guy a bad name ballistic I'll walk up and after mocking him out I Hope to be back on earth that about Nineteen eighty six\nYou know I had this microphone in front of this guy who is one of the most famous people on earth and we start to ask him questions\nOkay Mohammed Ali or how did you first\nBecome interested is laughing when I started about twelve years ago someone stole my bicycle amounts that I Want to learn how to fight so I'm going to catch him and beat him up but I never did catch him but ended up the challenge and the whole world answering while you were an amateur did you have a desire to become a professional ...\nYou know I didn't I just thought out as an amateur but um [noise] I didn't know that I Would end up to try and put it after winning all of amateur titles Lyndon came to America play dawned on me that I had a chance to Vietnam professional\nIs there any particular a boxer that you really idolize before you became a pro\nSugary around his in laws and my idol and still I think the greatest of all the times\nYou more or less trying to have them yourself after him for a little about ideas are not from the un foot were\nLeft jab and things like that ... did you resent that the training they go through for a major event you know under under whatever other in the last show three calls I've always like up there are more of a road we're going to raise the federal law\nThat will tell you about that um [noise] why did you feel that you had to campaign for your first fight with Samuel is one of those so minute fellows right over I mean I couldn't just wasn't home\nSo I have to I was ... it\nIt made me a bigger drawn cards or promoted want to me it was the risk of quicker shot in the title because of the talking before the fact that you think you had an edge over your opponent mentally or a little more calls for a reason they were frightened of and I'm afraid that does help a lot [noise]\nDid you expect a tougher fight from Madison listed on there that it wasn't a what do you have lasted longer because I wanted to the way the way of\nI'm proud of bigger and bigger [laughter] like\nWhat in your estimation is the future of boxing today\nWell as the boxer so I'm I'm all for the little guy the [noise] the would have as much as I did vote longer it will be All right [noise]\nWhat business would really like to go into after your retirement really they really lazy other real estate projects in the house [noise] okay very good thank you very much [noise]\nFor me to be sitting in front of this guy and interviewing him who credible and incredible something I'll never forget as long as I last\nSaw her all of it will be here waiting for me and tell your children before or they come to this world here on earth that the turban and leave a mark all all the ball can turn to you what the universal postal thank you\n[noise] I asked Michael what it's like to go back in time and listen to this kid this younger version of himself interviewing one of the most famous people in the world he said there are of course all kinds of things he wished he would have asked but he really only has one regret\nYou know I guess if I have any regrets at all is that I didn't get him to somehow spin has come out\n[laughter] [noise] during the interview you\nKnow we have also created an animated video version of this rare interview with Mohammed Ali it was produced in collaboration with story board tumblers inhouse editorial arm\nAnd sky doing Robbins over there she just did a great job making this come to life go to black on black dot org our website just see a stop motion Mohammed Ali fighting for the titles on Mars any drug stuff go help produce this audio version\nThat you've been listening to and last week Michael ... thank you for holding onto this interview all these years and letting us bring it to our listeners [laughter]\nI Hope all the journalists out there are inspired to look into their archives and tell us what you find our email interviews at like ... dot org like aren't like is distributed by public radio exchange\nP. R. I. X. dot org time David Gary Locke keep ...\nThe truth about me as I Am not perfect but I Want to be I value family home in a relationship I have been a good citizen and I want to be again\nWhat you're hearing is backing the guilt reading her tone the truth about me\nThe truth about me as I Am a good person and I care about it either\nOnly son can carry on the family or at least on can properly worships his ancestors\nWas that um hot policy the ones that will topple out on my maternal grandmother had no son's only daughters now she is old and has no one to care for her was as well as always we'll follow along the all male okay\nLet's do this you know it's a woman only has girls her in laws won't like her and we'll fight with her\nHer husband will be angry and often even divorced her I was lucky with my first pregnancy and it was a boy so I had him I didn't have an abortion\nIt without you know the mother wouldn't eat for nuts I'm like yeah well then let's see it as\nWell I mean does have a one room family planning clinic it provides simple treatments prenatal checkups and birth control [noise] Dr Lynn and his wife run the clinic and live in a small adjacent apartment with her young son\nDr Lynn explains it's illegal for parents to find out the sex or there may be in an ultrasound supposedly any health care provider who delivers that information will be heavily find or fired\nA practice continue as soon as the ones you either\nSome people you've collections they have with a doctor or someone in the government to find out the structure their baby others offered the doctors for money a bribe of thirty or forty dollars and find out that way\nStation as soon as I was a different views on abortion\nBased on gender are also illegal but they're readily available\nWhen local woman who declined to be recorded told me that after the birth of her first child a daughter she boarded her next two pregnancies at six months when she found out she was carrying girls\nShe told me this late stage abortions were acutely physically and emotionally painful but in her eyes necessary is they allowed her to try again for the son she now has [noise]\nI talked to are gathering spot in Wyoming is a local store it's a small stand with us two shelves of cooking oil Warmbier and candy ... runs the store he says the lack of eligible women is causing\nProblems in the community things on the bottom level to divide though\nHe's made a campfire wives are angry and depressed all they want to do is get drunk sleep and start fight even feel like they want to kill the don't feel

sense that when Mr sun drops off a little town vendors Jack tables out into the street to serve barbecue and fried noodles in the cooling open air\nI come across a group of young bachelors already deep into their Andy nice\nThough they are mostly in our early and mid thirties I mean one of them is married which in this region ten years ago I Would be unheard jazz over the pattern singing of his friends one of them in Monterey despite the hopelessness he feels I think thirty three and money\nIn the pool and the only woman I Would I of course\nOur parents are upset they expect us to carry on the lineage but without our own sons we care without a wife we have no window labor with to build a home at the work field we feel like we have no future to or\nNot you know\n\nFor this generation there are no easy answers\nThat many people including local residents to leave the lack of girls in China may finally changed our tradition that last seem unable to change more and more rural Chinese capitals are saying they'd like one boy and one girl\nThat may be going on for future generations this generation a bachelor's will continue to struggle with the unintended consequences of the most and issued a story about how way and\nThat story was reported and produced Jennifer done\nEach week on the science radio show and podcast the big picture science hosts that shot stuck in Mali badly connect ideas about the origin future and behavior of life in technology and surprising and playful ways astrobiologist David ... makes the case for life on Venus starting with why it probably doesn't exist on the surface\nIn Fahrenheit terms it's close to nine hundred degrees every day all day day night north south the only way you can get a little bit cooler than that on Venus is to go up to the top of one of the high mountains but that that doesn't buy you much it's it's pretty darn hot everywhere on being us on the surface\nOkay so even aside from considerations of you know the lack of lack of water no oceans know rivers no legs the fact that the atmospheres all this carbon dioxide and so what you mean aside from all that it looks like it's dead Jim me because any life would just be boiled away but you have another idea\nWell I think first of all and astrobiology we have to really keep a pretty open mind about\nThe question of habit ability because\nOur notions are so heavily biased towards our one planet so we have to be open to ideas that seemed like there are a little bit out of left field is as long as they're not so far out that that we're we're just chasing fairy tales but an interesting thing about Venus is that it has this cloud deck\nAbout thirty miles from the surface that is composed of liquid water granted liquid water in an intense acidic solution but yet there is a liquid medium and there are other properties of that cause deck that just conceivably I think could be conducive to life\nAnd so what you're suggesting is that Venus\nYeah I don't see any reason why there couldn't be something analogous to bacteria that could live in Cobb droplets on Venus\nThere's a liquid medium their energy sources there seemed to be nutrients and there are even some strange chemical properties of that region of the atmosphere that could be interpreted as somewhat conducive to some kind of life\nSo these are not big birds these are not atmosphere elephants these would be microbes\nFloating thirty miles up in the ... atmosphere now you said there's some interesting compounds up there but really how did these guys make a living I mean are they doing it by photosynthesis or they just eating chemicals in the atmosphere ... what what makes them tick what's their metabolism\nWhere there are a couple of possibilities photosynthesis is a possibility there is actually a fair amount of solar radiation up in the ... in fact if there was something up there that could take advantage of ultraviolet light\nNot a trick that we've seen on earth but a trick one might imagine that life somewhere in the universe could have mastered then there there's quite a bit of energy the other possibility is that they are taking in some kind of chemical energy\nThere are some interesting cycles in the atmosphere Venus involving volcanoes on the surface and sulfur gases in the atmosphere and transitions between energetic molecules and what will be called ... equilibrium where there is sort of\nEnergetic potential in the mix of chemicals and those are the kinds of things on earth\nThat life takes advantage of and if you don't look for the same specific metabolism that we have on earth but look for that general property of a chemical cycle\nThat could be exploited by organisms than you actually can come up with some examples on Venus of juicy chemicals that you could imagine could be eaten and digested and used to extract energy by organisms\nWell as long as we're talking about the theoretical possibility of life there I'll ask you to speculate a little bit farther would this life have been descended from\nLife left over from those very early days of Venus when we think that it was a lot more like the earth when it might have had surface oceans and and these are the remnants of an ancient the new version population of biology\nI think it's possible when Venus whether young planet it probably had oceans and in fact there was probably a time when Venus earth and Mars all had oceans and may even have been exchanging life between them\nSo there could have been an origin of life on Venus Venus could have been infected if you will with microbes from earth or Mars so if our current understanding of what it takes for a biosphere is correct\nThen there's every reason to believe that Venus could have had in our early biosphere and then the question is what happened to it when the oceans went away\nAnd life being so adaptable and sort of crafty at following the changes in a planet and finding nature's as it is done many times in the history of the earth\nOne at least can wonder if\nIt might have found a way to migrate to the upper atmosphere niche which still has some of those qualities of what we consider to be a habitable environment\nDavid how could we possibly find these things I mean if if you could somehow control the NASA Budget for the next Twenty years or how would you look for life on Venus [noise]",
