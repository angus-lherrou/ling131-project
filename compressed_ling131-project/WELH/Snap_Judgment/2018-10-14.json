them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow\n[noise]\nThis location of Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year so ... ... they got a destination yes\n[noise] the climate for use to massive peaks and dangerous clear faces but still as their helicopter descended into the care of the valley and the yellow law came into view they were blown away\nProbably would impact of this and let us that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than mountains are then everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to\nGet up ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle and I was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and\nI said here John do you mind holding this for a minute and I think that's probably one John's frame of mind started to shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled him up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie and he's patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like this triumphant moment and they like having among the shoulder and they're like ... will die like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cars and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and have tried to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goats and they ... they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's in charge that's a really bad guy elected himself president for\nLife and they're not allowed to freely study their religion\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of my from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nHe explained that John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was going to get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living was to escape by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned that John that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember about that myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try and wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our captors as as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murders somebody I very much saw them as victims of circumstances somewhere that specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day\nScenario like a good look at him it'd be like who's to say that I wouldn't be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but you would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of the characters are ... split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers when they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and\nThey did this for three days starving and I came up with just really good game to play to pass the time\nUm where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and you start imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it in five minutes and I think that's probably one time and change completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of set as weird where we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us and then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and obviously meant that he had fought the story that I spent a week selling to us just bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad in Denali served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out he he has this look like he's I Know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than\nThey split up deal tracking down towards the Base Camp will Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one\nI felt like my rib cage\nBall of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted a scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to ... and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one dumb kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changed everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on this sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find a\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this is the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and\nThe top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something and I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this do you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still need and will be morally and killing somebody but\nAt this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing up to class\nAnd it just sort of scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all and but as I was reaching out to grab his guns drop the sense what was going to\nHappen and he turned towards me that that are close to him I reached out to grab his gun strap and I pulled as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he has the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and his\nWhole body let us really horrible cracking sound is really loud and then he tumbled often the darkness and\nI sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then Beth showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nAnd wrap your arms around me and just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember ... you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on pedaling on my head down to really like look ahead crunch revolving salt like one two one two something like that you gotta you know you had that sense of joy and you're just like wind down it\nAnd then too was always happy and healthy do until one day\nA few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with Mel formation in his brain [noise]\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with grand mal promotions\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... brain Mel formations had nothing to do with one another [noise] but spenders brain situation didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery it could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time spent two became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about ... about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nAh just knocked started coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person center was scared his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor the case of an otherwise kind and gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all men are familiar made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\n\nRisky surgery instant connection changer\nEven if they help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regrets about my own surgeries because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every day\nTime\nMinute fair to him that one of my biggest regrets surgeries in in my surgeries inside it's made me a somewhat better person at times\nUm\nAnd I get a little philosophical with you\nThere's like ... okay [noise] um so\nIn like ... story with Amy I'm been foisted question who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that's intimate by our brain\nOr something less physical and I wonder your thoughts on\nMy beliefs problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from set a goal to there we spent having severe headaches began and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent you was just talking about or J. British and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of as bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and there for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his breath I I I thought we would lose them\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles ... got to ... hospital room in the ice you [noise] to see them in a coma in\nA condition that I Hope only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish they could have been union [noise]\n\nWant to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should ever have to make which snap judgment the override episode continues stay too [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThis is the public radio [noise]\nIt's more of a snap judgment [noise]\nFollowed by the moth radio hour at nine o'clock [noise] the news from the b._b._c.

going\nGuys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little pony or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on this guy and despite his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker robbed and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nUm\nAs they marched onto the rocky terrain and one of their captors bear split on now is only two characters with guns to for climbers when they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and\nThey did this for three days starving and I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and you start imagining and exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and\nWhere you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again [noise]\nAnd then finally one of his broken extra time it was only two guesses and it turns out that have been five minutes and I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we were starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they could also communicate their plans with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nAnd do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said so here's the deal I'm going to go back up to your guys his Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as guard and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of set in a weird way of ... we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us and then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and and obviously in ... he had bought the story that I spend a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker [noise]\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad in Denali served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him became shot and he was had Tarasoff away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him enough go the he has this look like you know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off than\nThey split up dual tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one\nI felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere was just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy has got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave one dumb kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate that basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified on a sort of trend especially\nSince it was the middle of the night\nI'm\nCommunicated with each other that they was game on and this is going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the\nMountain together and I'm always trying to find a\nI'm trying to always kind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way to also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell they were there like this is the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then and then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge with Beth and\nThe top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this I think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me and were racing to\nClass and it just so scrambled\nUp over behind him and she wasn't expecting\nIt at all and but as I was reaching out to grab is God's job the sense what was going to happen and he turned towards me up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping a poll as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of wanting to spark through them in like an eternity looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nAnd so he has the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let out this really horrible uh cracking sound is really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness and\nI sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then best showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nAnd wrap your arms around me and just tried to come from and I was like trembling and I remember I remember you know for some reason in that moment I just needed her approval so much throughout this whole thing um\nI mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now from Asians\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... ... email formations had nothing to do with one another [noise] but it's been through brain to generation didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery it could cause more problems than it would resolve [noise]\nAnd this was about the time when you became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never had surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just across the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's about as there's about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared of I'm\nJust not read coming out of surgery as a totally different person I think is when I was scared of\nA different person [noise] center was scare his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything was them all met her from it made him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery is a connection treasure\nEven up to help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nExpressing from my regrets about my own surgeries because I still have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every\nTime\nMade it to him that one of my biggest regrets surgeries and and my surgeries and ah [noise] it's made me a ... somewhat better person at times\nUm [noise] so\nCan I can let all the fish will suck all with you especially since ... [laughter] okay um so in like Julie ... story with Amy\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that's in ... by our brain or something less physical and then when I thought so\nMy beliefs problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly sympathetic will see there we spent having severe headache again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was a helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital and my husband and I spent she was just talking about or jihad brash and shortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of as bad holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as I read and\nThere for a few minutes as I watched and try to\nCatch his breath I I I thought we would ...\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to spend ... hospital room in the ice you [noise] to see them [noise] in a coma in\nA condition than I Am home only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWant to take a short break and when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision that you know family [noise] she ever had to make one snap judgment the override episode continues stay too [noise]\n\n[noise]\nThis is the public radio [noise]\nMore snap judgment coming up [noise]\nFollowed by the Ted radio hour at three o'clock [noise]\nHandle you know usa [noise]\nYou're listening to the public's radio [noise]\nWe don't answer to shareholders political interests readings or clicks we answer to our community\nAnd in a democracy that civic discourse we need to hear what our fellow citizens I think we need to hear what scientists think we need to know whether our elected officials are going to stand up for\nOur stories are not the end of the conversation there the beginning because we're not just\nPublic radio we are the public's radio [noise]\nSnap judgment is supported by target presenting future at heart a podcast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie and cats or wherever pond cancer found\n[noise]\nFrom W unless the studios will come back to snap judgment the override episode when it was in Washington and when we left off the young man's Spencer you lay unconscious some hospital because all the Mel formation in his brain and all that his family knew was that no matter what he never\nOh you've been through and had a stroke and while he lay in the hospital bed sedated he's family his mom and dad Steve and his brother still had to decide what to do ... to me they had to decide whether or not to operate\nThey're surgeons name was Dr Keim and Dr Kim told them that if they did not operate now there was a one to five percent chance it's been two would have another strip\nAnd that chance we increased every year of his life\nBut the surgery he was proposing with very risky when Dr King when explaining these very daunting odds any recording it because she could go back and listen to what he said over and over\nAt some risk associated with it about\nFive to ten percent chance of major complications from surgery or mine or ... or anything in between um\nKnow that the surgery before this half [noise]\nMakes it to the situation is dramatic changes and knowing that we know now with all that you know what would you want us to do and I think that's the position of putting your guys then is to make that determination nobody in the world knows and better then review\nUm so it's not what you want or what I Want to rent or my mom or dad happier [noise]\nWhat would you want and that's where we're at [noise]\nHave you ever performed another surgery with a typical the buzz cut I heard of the brain naturally yes that okay for him at the cabinet by the\nSubject that sort of done multiple do I have I Know that there is risk but it's not a theoretical risks are real risk if\nIt happened all those particular surgery fiction drawn to that area what was the outcome will get a ... percent of them\nFive to ten percent of them have a bad outcome\nAnd the one that they wish they hadn't done the operation\nAnd you'll go crazy tried to convince yourself that you can figure out if he's going to have a complication now and you can't just keep going around in circles wondering like well\nYeah I think it's important that it's an intellectual decision but it's also an intuitive one I think the best decisions are like you have to feel good about not just in your rationalizing and so forth Gulf here Scott and listen to your gut instinct\nDr Kim Luft room any like Steve stew and said [noise]\nYou're saying though [noise] I don't know what I'm saying\n[laughter] that's yeah that's why I'm Sorry I just before we just have before we say hey you know I met before we discuss it I just want to like get like a draw okay ... yeah yeah I Want to I Want to I'm about to have more time to sort of yeah I Want to go walk", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment",
