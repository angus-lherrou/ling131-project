new\n[noise]\nToday's topic [noise] how do we need our houses without cooking the planet\nWith me as Steven Porter and Megan hall Stevens is a professor of environmental science at Brown university a few years ago he renovated this has to make it extremely energy efficient he'll talk about it to pretty much anyone who listen he's kind of obsessed with the stuff here's his daughter Phoebe\nI don't think it's in my closet living here was like watching an inconvenient truth Ninety percent of the time every time we were watching it and they were like the\nFirst thing I'd like you guys this is my life\nAnd God Bless her uh have just a good time to camp [laughter]\nOn the other hand we have Megan hall she's a writer and a former reporter who just bought our first house it's old and it needs some repairs but she doesn't have a lot of money or a lot of time\nCan someone like making big changes to her home that are both affordable and energy efficient\nWith these renovations makes sense for her family and what will Steven say we'll talk to Megan in Stephen to find [laughter]\nSo welcome to Megan hall Hi Nancy how this I'll get started\nAll right so we're all having dinner a little while ago and Steven was bragging about his renovations he loves to talk about them\nAnd he he was saying that if you want to make this kind of change to your house may get more energy efficient the best thing to do is to pair it with some sort of big change that you were already going to make to your house\nAnd I said well I just bought a house and I think we need a new roof is this the time to do something special to make it more energy efficient and he said definitely\nSo tell us a little bit about your has can you describe in our house it was built in Nineteen fifty it's the Cape and lived there with my husband and my two daughters there to enforce the little girls\nIt's a great house with lots of space but it's old and one thing about it is that upstairs where the girls are it gets really really hot he hears just some sound of me talking to my my husband about that the other day\nNow sometimes when I bring the girls upstairs and [laughter] I feel like such a jerk I'm like oh it's really a miserable for [laughter] for that upstairs\nAnd and the thing about it is we actually do have central air conditioning we just only turn it on every once in a while when it's really hot or once when I was pregnant a but now that the girls are up there I\nI feel like I think about turning it on more when I think about how uncomfortable they are and what cruel parents we are because it's cooler down here that it as\nWell put that fair on welfare\nOut also add that in the wintertime there are many days where I'm In the house and I feel really cold\nFormer outside than it is inside\nSo it's fair to say that you're has has some heating and cooling challenges yes now Stephen tests that yes\nSo my house is uh was built in Nineteen twenty um we moved in in two thousand seven and a like Americans house it was freezing cold in the winter especially in patches so you'd sit on the floor and it would be cold but it wouldn't be cold in the stairwell or whatever\nAnd a couple of years ago I had some time to think about how to renovate it in a way that would make it a lot more comfortable and a lot more energy efficient as you heard from Phoebe I'm sort of obsessed with climate change and how we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we let out into the atmosphere so off we went\nAnd what did it cost well the bottom line is it costs about a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars to do all of the renovations so not a truly on I'm not a trivial amount I Will add that my mortgage is a hundred and fifty thousand for sure\nI'll add on to that and say\nSome of it was for stuff that definitely needs to be done anyway the attic wasn't really very nice or usable we renovated it so that we can get access to the roof put in a ton of insulation and then made it into a really beautiful like master bedroom suite and my wife and I moved up there\nSo now you have a super energy efficient hats and why does it matter to you what's at stake here\nWell it matters for two reasons about us for personal reason which is the house is much more comfortable and I feel better about living in it and the second reason flows from that I feel better about living in it because\nThe heating our houses is a big part of our greenhouse gas emissions on greenhouse gas emissions are making for a worse future for me and my children and everybody else and everybody else's children\nAnd how much does heating has this contribute to climate change\nSo in the U.S it's about six percent in New England is much higher than that because New England as a cold climate or so it's probably closer to Fifteen Percent I actually did the calculation for Megan and for Megan it's about half of her greenhouse gas emissions come from heat in her house wow so it's actually quite substantial\nI didn't realize it was that much I thought it'd be twenty percent or something like that All right so you know what you did with your has which was a substantial renovation and what were you hoping that making would do\nWell I'm not a building expert so what I was hoping she would do is seriously consider coupling what she needed to do with a little bit extra that would have a dramatic impact on the amount of gas that she was new to burn to her house and\nI thought that probably would include insulation and might include changes to her heating equipment like her boiler\nSo this podcast is in bad that\nWhat's Megan going to do she knows she's got Steven sitting on his shoulder suggesting that she'd be very conscientious that her energy efficient but then there other factors at play to write Meghan right so I don't have a lot of\nSpare money to put into renovation I have young children that take up a lot of attention and my husband\nIs pretty sentimental here's something that he said about his instincts when it comes to protecting the environment\nA lot of other places in life I'm like I'm not going to get a new one I'm going to take care of this old when the statue of that I have like any you know what I mean any old thing I feel like I'm doing my best and I'm making the world a better place and I'm like not part of the problem if I'm just taking care of my old stuff Ryan\nSays that he has the little key to our radiator and he treasures bleeding each radiator every year and he likes the ritual of that so he's really attached to these\nOld objects and ...\nUnderstand that feeling very very well and he's right actually that in most cases if you're not buying something new you actually are doing something very conservative in the contribution sense of the word conservative [noise]\nUm but on the other hand the way that we are doing business as usual living a entirely dependent on fossil fuels\nIs having dramatic changes already and it's going to have even bigger changes here in Rhode Island and around the world we're going to lose a lot of coastline we're gonna see maple syrup production disappeared from New England were going to see all sorts of big changes that I'm sentimental about as well it's just a different kind of sentimental\nSo that's the quandary yes Megan where did you start okay so after I talk to Steven I already knew that I needed to make some changes to my house and so I had an inspector come out to the house and just take a look at the entire thing the guy that came out was named them Charles grassy\nAnd he goes like ...\nFor this was like twenty fifth year the name of my company is going to ...\nTo chip came out to my house and she found a lot of things that really\nAffects your actual power [noise] I thought was to be able to uh [noise]\nI Would say the number one thing that he found was related to what Steven cares about and that was about the efficiency of our half\nThe other night the Voyager Nineteen fifties inflation [noise] you know for two thousand Eighteen energy costs sets a bad combination\nFor as a whole different way [noise]\nI had almost no insulation in our route and we have this boiler from when the house bill that is so big it was originally built the whole coal to\nWe'll see we'll see\n[noise] now what about insulation okay so um our inspectors said we needed insulation Dave Caldwell who\nWorks with Steven said we needed insulation\nThere seemed to be unanimous agreement that our house definitely needed that and where does this leave you in terms of your thinking Ryan and I talked about it and we were interested in doing both things depending on the cost the problem with that we didn't have any hard numbers and I asked Steve Caldwell to give us a quote and he was very hesitant to do that\nBecause he couldn't see her how she didn't know our situation he didn't want to say anything on tape that he couldn't backup\nSo what we did was we called national grid and we got a company called rise engineering to come out to the house and do an energy audit [noise]\nErin Erin Michele Michele\nWelcome that Aaron ... and Michelle swimming from rise anyway they came in and\nUh they happened to come in on my kids were trying to take a nap you might be in the background [noise]\nThey were very thorough they went all over the house they went downstairs and looked at the boiler I suffered hills [laughter] it's probably not extremely efficient Michele went outside and you know drilled into our walls\nTo see if we'd insulation that [noise] so they came to the fall assessment\nAnd then Michelle sat down for about an hour and started plugging in numbers to describe what she thought we needed to do to our house and how much it would cost an hour of number crunching Oh yes most of it was just her sitting\nDown taking all the data that she gathered about our house and typing up a word plan and the cost estimate for making her house more energy efficient [noise]\nSo the first time in this to you have a hard numbers and you're going to use those as you're trying to make a decision about what to do their has how much more will Meg you'd have to pay will get the numbers after the break\n[noise]\nYou're listening to possibly before the break Megan had an energy audit upper house to see how much would actually cost to fix the insulation in her home and to buy what's called a heat pump which is a super efficient electric way to heat and cool there has so where did you find out\nSo our major issue with our house is that we have these what are called me walls so they're these little sections on either side of the girl's room there just empty space\nWhen we heat our house the heat just go straight up through that knee well and into the roof and that's why they're room is really cold in the winter and really hot in the summer Michele from rice says that's pretty easy to fix was\nThis area's inflated you typically see a complete one eighty and compatibility on the ... level\nSo Michele recommended insulating those new walls doing some work in the basement she had a whole list of things for us to do\nI've recommended at the same ready to board for the cells will take care of the roof ... also inflate the floor with fourteen inches of cells and she gave you a price\nYes so at the end of all of that she put all the numbers together and gave me this piece of paper\nThat had our work order on it\nAnd the cost for every item that she recommended that we we do and all of this was just related to inflating the house and they're more than twelve items on here\nTotal would be just under six thousand you get Seventy five percent off and ten hours of air sealing for free so brings you to Thirteen forty six\nThat sounds pretty reasonable Stephen ... [laughter] a lot less money than I was expecting her to say on the other hand not knowing what she was really proposing to do it not\nThat it's a start total it's affordable and it leads to the next issue which is that heat pump\nAnd it's called the heat pumps but it also cools so is it a possibility I asked Michelle about that because I heard that national grid offers zero percent loans for purchasing energy efficient heaters\nWhich I had done I'd gotten one of those loans\nAs far as going from gas electric I don't really know [noise] I just don't want to say a hundred percent that it is so she told me to call someone at rise who's an expert on this I called her name was Janine Steven knows her she's\nNodding I think I talk to her when I went through the strike [laughter]\nTalked to Janine I called her she's very nice she said number one you can't get to zero percent loan for air conditioning in Massachusetts you can but for some reason Rhode Island hasn't caught up so they will only help with efficient heating but this is even\nTrue so that was my second question I said but here's my plan my plan is to put it in and it will both heat and cool the house and then I'll use the boiler just when it's\nReally cold and she said that's a problem because that would be supplemental to your heating system not replacing it and we can only give you a zero percent loan if you're actually replacing your inefficient heater\nSteven is holding his head right now with the exasperation\nYeah I you know it makes sense to me that you have to make them rural\nBut that's a very unfortunate bureaucratic hurdle to what is genuinely a good solution so out of pocket what would a heat pump cost I think the probably the cost of the heat pump would be maybe three thousand dollars maybe twenty five hundred but it really does depend on the size that you would need and you would need to an actual\nQuote yeah I think when I was talking to someone else who did some work for you he said that the heat pump plus all of the installation in any sort of changes would probably be more close to six thousand dollars or something like okay so where does this leave us\nWhat did you in mind is that I sat down with Ryan and I asked him what he thought we should do do you think it's a waste of money to spend Thirteen hundred dollars\nPutting much inflation and the house\nI mean I guess it's not that much money I think it'll make it a little bit nicer up there\nHe said he do it for me because he knew it mattered to me but you can't really see insulation it's it's it's not something you'd brag about your friends when they come over it's just not a Chevy or a Porsche right [laughter] it's relations and he just couldn't get too excited about it\nI totally get it it's the easiest thing to do it's the most bang for your buck in terms of helping the world making your house feel better about your book doesn't go into a new car that you can see or a new porch or a new kitchen or whatever that feels different\nBut your senses you're going to go ahead with the insulation yet so we each signed for it and hopefully now will be cleared to have some contractors to come in and put in all this insulation and then what about the heat pump\nAnd those are the type of people we have our old stuff but it's getting worse by I think when ARSA breaks that'll be the way to go for now it took a commercial for trouble\nYeah I agree so Ryan is okay with getting a heat pump eventually\n[noise]\nSteven what do you think you proud of me or did I Do the right thing [noise] I'm very\nAre we okay we should continue to be friends [laughter] so I think it's a very\nRational and reasonable decision you know I think the unfortunate thing is that\nEverybody everybody making the decision that makes sense for their own personal situation isn't enough to solve the problem that we're already experiencing and that our children certainly you're going to experience too dramatic way so yeah I don't I Hope you got new heat pump come sooner rather than later\nI'm going to go out and sabotage or conditioner\n[laughter] and I met nerves [laughter] we will leave\nThings there and possibly checking with Megan a year from now and see how the insulation has affected her electricity costs in the comfort of her house and to see if their condition or has broken until then I'm ... I'm Megan hall\nAnd I'm Steve and for [noise] possibly is written by us and produced by making music and sound design is by Tom ... Stephen ... is our founder executive\nProducer and ultimate fact advisor funding comes from the instituted brand for environment in society and its program for environmental and civic engagement\nWith any kind of support from Rhode Island public radio but the opinions and this type cast come from us not fat and Steven ... who is so obsessed with his decision the renovations his daughter drew him a picture of the ideal water heater\nIn the whole idea was to make hot water heater that would serve the environmental benefits\nNow the idea was to make a hot water heater saying stop planning [laughter]\n[noise]\n\nThis is Rhode Island public radio in the balance from the b._b._c. world services next followed by the Ted radio hour at three\nMile ... sat next time on Latino USA the conversation with Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor about writing to books for kids bowl challenges are not to be just putting them when\nThey become a party of what we hang with us that next time on the you know you were saying\nSo trade tensions means ... end up having to pay more but Martha ... something like that be worth it to President Trump's tactics create new deals with say Mexico and Canada to go crazy but one is still waiting to see whether those tactics work\nAllow a rich guy to do\nAnd it will cost from people all the way it is\nWisconsin is historically a democratic state the last time it never really voted for Trump making the politics of business sensitive here\nMany of those voters seem to be wasting to see where all this leads Republicans anxious as mid term elections leading this November I trying to prop up the farming village\nWashington announced twelve billion dollars the subsidies to mitigate the effects of some terrorist especially on soybean exports but in some ways not to know comfortable move for supposedly free market Republican\nGovernment and to be fed some sections of the American economy have been complaining for years that the trade playing field has been inclined against them [noise]\nHere in Plymouth in Wisconsin you get the idea originally this still thinks of itself at the G capital of the world because just on the edge of a downtown here\nThere is actually a statue of a joint bad recast about twenty feet tall and black and white with a lovely wooden frame in front of me with a kind of history of the town saying how the dairy cows were introduced Nineteen Seventy from Europe by Eighteen eighty two\nBut national cheese exchange we just don't just around the corner of the building is just around the corner was open and it became a chase capital of the world there are still many chief factories here in town we're going to see one of them in a minute what's really worrying them if terrorists on dairy products around the world [noise]\nThis right here is ... is our raw milk intact so milk comes in here seven days a week from our family farms we have cows to produce milk every single day we make she's every single day so\nSo to relax ginseng was founded by immigrants in this case Italian once you started out digging ditches before Nineteen thirty nine tuning the native expertise and cheese making into a successful business\nIt shows just how immigration into the U.S has boosted international trade links ... just a few hundred yards from not joined cow manager can paint showed me how did they make one of them most popular products\nReferred me to tell us what I'm going to be\nYou can get the mail about four hours ago\nSo it's very very fresh [noise]\nThen across the road they're finishing great wheel is a ... coup underground rooms like one settlers were had to go preparing ... cheese\n\nIt all has a very European feel making parmesan\nTouching taught wheels of cheese in ... well ... ... settlers so tore even took on Italian producers and cheese competitions and won an expert Dr in recent years has taken so tore into sixty countries around the world but then it run up against that must be juggling all of that is the e you\nAnd especially its rules of geographic origin\nThe you kind of free trade deal with Mexico but that meant ... could no longer cool it's hard cheese parmesan in the Mexican market\nOnly Italian cheese from Palmer can be cold parmesan and sell at a premium price now touring cools hits hard cheese ... zone or in Mexico and sells it for less as a result\nYou deals also restrict how much thought to a recon selling nearby Canada the company's president is Jeff Schweitzer\nEuropean Union has negotiated with Canada and now Seventy percent of the cheese that can go into Canada has to come from Europe\nAnd only thirty percent from the rest of the world and then tariffs are duties after that or two hundred and fifty to two hundred and Seventy four percent\nNow most people wouldn't understand that as free trade agreement between the European Union and Canada affects American produces how can the European fist on having Seventy defensive imports into Canada for cheese and ruin your market\nUh I think they're taking a long term look I mean if you think about the United states is probably thirty three thirty five percent of the world's economy today Europe is thirty three thirty five percent and the rest of the world is there if you think\nTen years Twenty years out maybe the U.S is twenty five percent of the world's economy Europe's twenty five percent of the world's economy the rest of the world is fifty percent in uh Europe has control for trade agreements in that they're going to win and dairy\nSo there were many challenges already dead before the Trump Administration began its trade policy it certainly didn't feel like a level playing field to sell jewelry [noise]\nBut now chief produces face additional terrorists imposed by other countries and retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on things like imported steel so Tori is having to decide how much extra caustic can absorb to stay in those expensively developed export markets\nAnd yet there is still sympathy for the Trump approach especially given the way in which the ... has been protecting its own dairy industry\nI think it is you know trying a different strategy to get some change and at least\nWhen you look at it I'm not sure it's to favor America I think it's more to get a level playing field I think in some cases at least on the the dairy side we've had an favorable situations from a free trade standpoint\nBut do you think it will in the end produce out of the trouble is you've got a little things like steel and then you'd you look around and something comes up potatoes or cheese was not then you become much more on level\nThe ideal situation as an individual and it was a company we believe in free trade and let's let the consumer decide what's right\nBut terrorists do the opposite of that consumers have no choice but to pay more will do without terrorists on taxes for up prices\nPresident Trump has been promising his strategy might mean short term pain but in ... long term game but it will bring jobs and prosperity back to the United states\nBut said the south in Wisconsin's biggest city Milwaukee the opposite has happened with a symbolic blow the famous motorcycle manufacture a Harley Davidson announced that in response to retell a tree terrorists from Europe it would move some production abroad\nHonestly Wilson is a trade specialist with the New York times\nDavidson's as um some of his core supporters and he has pointed that out\nFrequently I think that's one of the reasons that Harley Davidson decision to offshore some of its production because of the tests became such a political can talking point for the president and fat that others in the United states they are being hit by a terrorist from Europe and so they decided to\nMove that portion of bike production that would go to the European market offshore they said that by manufacturing these forty thousand motorcycles in the United states that would be headed for Europe they would face\nPotentially thirty to forty five million dollars in tax penalties and that was the pay they just weren't willing to pay\nPresident Trump reacted angrily to that decision blaming it for a fool and Harley Davidson sales in the United states it's certainly a sensitive subject for the company they would not give us an interview but hopeful that decision led to rumblings of discontent amongst its flag waving owners [noise]\n\nThis year is one hundred and Fifteen under those three of the Harley Davidson company not a very round number but enough of one for a policy in veterans park on the lake shore in Milwaukee it attracted hundreds of bike 'cause [noise]\nBrooklyn road dogs stunt Reuters an ice cold there was an old American seen we've predominantly white middle aged tattooed male relatives in leather boots and bananas what did they make good police decision to move some production abroad [noise]\nA lot of the production staff everybody talked about they hadn't told the whole story I'm sharing\nOut of things that are ... are made out of controversy cycles are going out of country not necessarily the insect motorcycles because the parents and things like that says hey it's not that they're sending production ever seen the heart of the production is going everything he can help with the parents and things like that\nAnd who do you blame the terrorists because yeah [laughter] yeah the president I think it's just the economy went south kinds of Cancun everybody I Can't do anything and I learned in the world we live and\nWhat do you think about all the moving some of their production out of America I think it's kind of sad you know it's taken food all of our laws you know how you got to compete when he got paid to three times the price for steel on on um [noise]\nDo you think the president putting those tariffs on steel and many of them made a difference [noise]\nTo push them away [noise]\nI don't know anything about hairs I pay taxes are I'm sure that has a little bit to do it but I don't mind because we're usa and we are in spite of the critics [noise] the best place to be on the plane", "show_name": "Snap Judgment",
