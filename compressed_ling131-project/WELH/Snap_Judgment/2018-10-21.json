everybody\nAnd I remember moving into this place and it's an older building Manchester is an old mill town and a lot of the houses are a hundred two hundred years old\nShortly after we moved in\n... my dad actually said to my sister and I hey why don't we check out the addict\nWhich seems innocuous enough in the middle of the day for all of us to go up there and and and poke around [noise]\nUm [noise] I remember distinctly that there were Cain\nHanging on the ban is there on the way up to the addict\nWho and when we got upstairs we kind of poking around there were a lot of\nOld clothes old stress lessons are old\nVinyl records and an entire raccoon on the back wall\nOf life magazine dating back to [noise] you know God Knows when neatly catalog so it really looked like this was somebody's whole life up here [noise]\nI [noise] now like we were in meeting someone else to me [noise]\nI remember hearing like I was surrounded by someone else belongings\nAnd we did not belong there [noise] that was looking through these life magazine and I remember very clearly that make it was becoming more and more uncomfortable with the fact that he was pulling them all out of order and Mike was feeling like\nDon't touch that this isn't yours don't touch it [noise]\nIt wasn't just old magazines and records up there in the attic looking around I remember\nDistinctly seeing a rope tied to one of the rafters and cut at the not\n[noise] not only did he noticed the rope tied on the raft or\nHe actually found\nMike send the news on the floor of the addict tossed into a dusty corner\nFred tried to distracted sent to make light of makes terrific discovery as best he could still everyone\nWas shaken up and I think we all kind of feel like that's when things\nEscalate it got worse for us [noise]\n\nMike and cat Lewis right on the weekends and with their mom during the week when the kids are with their mom Fred was all alone in the house\nI was getting ready to go to work I had a a a daytime appointment book which was vital to me [noise]\nAnd I was in a rush\nAnd I had to\nPut this book on top of a better or post these were the stairs leading to the front door downstairs\nAnd I put it on a post to simply time my shoes [noise] now I Know I put it on the post is\nNo doubt I bend down time my shoe I get up\nIt's gone [noise] I went so far to go into the garage to see if I left that in my car I I have to find a sport [noise] I come back and it's on the post flipped over\nUpside on [noise] and I just grabbed it and ran out of the house\nAnd then there was a light in the attic\nAt least once or twice a week when I Would come home the addict like would be on so much so that I Would have to I Will be the only one really to access go upstairs shut it off of course it would creep me out\nYou try to rationalize I don't want to believe that something is here messing with me\nOn the weekends when cat and micro within ... never mentioned the things he experienced he didn't want them to get scared away that still\nCat in might can help to pick up on the fact that something was off about the apartment\nYou could see things out of the corner of your eyes and as soon as he turned to them nothing would be there\nI\nCould barely ever sleep so I'm lying in bed awake [noise]\nUh [noise]\nWith my door open hallway laid on trying to\nIgnore the uneasy feeling that was always president and [noise] I er here in the sink turn on in the kitchen [noise] ah everyone is in their separate bedrooms and I know nobody turn it on\n\nFred Mike and cat never told each other and they thought something was going on they can barely believe themselves still about six months after moving in del decided did she get a kitten we got the cat\nAs kind of a warm fuzzy presence in the house I think we're all feeling like\nYou had so much turmoil and darkness kind of going on in our personal lives that we just wanted something to make us\nTo come home every day and I remember we were so excited\n... homes [noise]\nShe was just such a warm sweet cat and\nIt was really nice to have her around\nThe kittens seemed to make the apartment a little brighter\nSide could sleep through the night when kids forgotten kitten with snuggle up next to him something strange happening [noise]\nDark dingy I remember we painted clouds all over my walls to try to break it up and make it feel a little more cheery and but I still had this feeling of drag Everytime I go into my bedroom [noise]\nCatch it having really scented recurring nightmares\nThere would be a man standing over my bad staring down at me watching these sleep and he would take his fingers and run them down the flash on my face and I began waking up with scratches [noise]\n\nAt first I thought the case may be scratching his doctors face [noise] she was in\nMy dad decided that he was going to try something to see if this would help because I think he was worried that it was a self inflicted kind of scratch and she decided\nTo tape mittens to me at night to see if\nI could stop myself from scratching and still I Would wake up wet scratching my head [noise]\nI almost feel like this thing was kind of feeding on our energy we were in a bad state we all were traumatized we had a lot of negative things going on in our lives\nIt was a it was a bad transition for for all of us [noise]\nAnd I think that definitely awoke whatever was there and make things worse [noise]\nFred cat and make for clothes and he managed to find comfort in each other and things to the apartment got to be too much\nWeekends at the apartment my dad and I would go out all day we would send the day outside doing fun things just trying to get some fresh air and lighten the mood a little bat\nOne day we came home\nAnd we could hear\nThe cat in the ... [noise] but she didn't come running to act and usually the second we came home she kind of Trump's the kitchen and say well I'm so we thought it was odd that she's not anywhere to be found but we can hear her soft little meow\nSo making eye and dad we searched all over the house looking for the cat thinking like maybe she got stuck in a closet who knows what happened and and I found her\nIn my bedroom and\nWrapped around her neck and she was hanging off of that code [noise]\nTerrified that was\nJust sickening terrifying feeling like something had gotten her [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "city": "Providence", "day": "21"}
