says the evidence that they have so far I strongly suggest that this was a planned operation basically dismissing the Saudis story that it was an accident\nOr one new thing that he said uh is that part of the evidence that they have is that the Saudi team that showed up in advance of the killing scout it out some areas possibly for disposal of a body including a forest in northeast ... ah and then he also a in his remarks called Henri odd\nOr to allow the Eighteen people they've arrested in connection with the show ... death to be prosecuted in Turkey they have all gone back to Riyadh Saudi Arabia so they wouldn't have to be extradited\nUm the Turkish president also says ah this evidence they've got so far raises big questions including on whose orders was this killing carried out why there's such a delay and allowing the consulate and other properties to be searched\nAnd why has the Saudi explanation of what happened change so many times so it at all points to the fundamental question was it a rogue operation is Riyad suggests or was the leadership and\nOkay so some new information they're affirming on the record that the Turks believe this Saudi team scout at places to dispose of a body did want confirm any of the other various news reports about bits of damning information\nWell probably the biggest thing that has come out so far in anonymous ah reports from

but in the long term there may be more at stake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others\nThey will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans dominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after twenty twenty what is the problem that you're trying to address\nBut we are trying to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTwo droid gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blood when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that it's slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\n[noise] no I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have\nAggressive as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nHow are you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their batch [noise]\nNo I don't think I'll criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen\nThe governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen and who will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process and twenty Twenty one state legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the

organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a gift for over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting

Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says uh they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ensure a or a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made your what your wrist off a famous remark by Michelle Obama when\nThey go low [noise] they go low\nWe did what did you mean or what I meant ... ... ... in that remark was at a I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that or parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protests through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate well\nI certainly think through votes through protests um I I just say that just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going act them at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump ... who was very powerful
