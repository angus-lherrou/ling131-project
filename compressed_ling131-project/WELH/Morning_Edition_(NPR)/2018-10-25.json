no place in the United states of America\nHe was speaking after packages containing what are described as pipe bombs were sent to senior democratic leaders including former president Brock Obama and former secretary of State Hillary Clinton CNN's office in New York also got one of these packages and two days earlier an explosive device was founded the home of billionaires\nThese individuals in

this winning by former FBI deputy director John Pistole going sir good morning Noel\nAll right so we have a situation involving lied explosive devices apparently intended to do harm what are the FBI and other federal investigators trying to determine if the states\nWill surely the key is trying to ... obviously ... by the perpetrator or the the individuals who are responsible for male and a devices\nAnd they're really looking at it from a two perspectives one is the forensics that is involved in each of the devices and the fact that there are multiple devices is actually very helpful to the investigators\nBecause they can compare and contrast and and just get a a richer picture if you will of that forensic data set and so that includes things like is there are their fingerprints is their DNA or the hair fibers just different things that the the experts will look at\nThe other aspect is the intelligence part of it and that really has two parts also when the was there prior intelligence meaning prior reports about people threatening any of these individuals\nAnd of course the secret service has a lead on that as a way to protect the the former presidents and such\nAnd

Wall street yesterday the Dow fell more than six hundred points\nToday Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang saying index in Hong Kong flipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January\nAnd its currency has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nGood morning I was thirty percent drop for China stock markets sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\n[noise] well John is calling me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWhat what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollars\nAnd Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast China is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped

closing off access to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but because Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided

losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei\nHang saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because China stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nGood morning while I was thirty percent drop for ... stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on [noise]\nWell China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy of say the valley\nSee the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWell what's interesting here no al is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes\nBlocks chained the technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action summit in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all\nSorts of land use agriculture\nPerfect oils frustration our\nSometime and co chairs the climate change ... he came to the conferences spread awareness about plunging so what is it\n... chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like the ... is like an accounting\nBook everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but it said on the computers of everyone on the block ching\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer due endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits distance the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon carbon markets\n... nobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNot a company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of silicon valley's big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entire problem something not solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change mock says there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nRent PR News I'm Sam honey [noise]\nServing in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts this is the public's radio eighty nine point three FM Thursday morning October twenty fifth and still to come this morning that Saudi business conference is packed despite suspicions that the Saudi Government just murdered a journalist\nThat story coming up after a news update here on the public's radio [noise]\nWe get support from listeners like you including Deborah and protected\nAnd from orchard condominium suffering single level two and three bedroom condo in a forest setting in West Warwick on the Cranston line W.

trial\nNow joining us to talk about this case and what the NC double a can do to clean up corruption in college athletics is Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone also familiar voice on our program Heather Kevin hey how're you doing to I'm good thank you so what does all this mean for college basketball as a whole what happened yesterday\nUnless your name's anything for college basketball um in in total because what happened here was a pretty isolated\nExposes the recruiting practices have been going on in a big time college athletics and football and particularly in basketball\nFor as long as I can remember and that is basically they're channeling of money from a one source um to the families of talent um to ensure that that talent goes to a particular school\nAnd what has happened over the years is that the uh manufacturers of of basketball shoes Adidas\nA Nike or those those uh operations\nHave gotten people in the middle of them um to help transfer that money so that the surprise here is that it has been criminalize or by the federal government as opposed to be policed by uh the NC double A. as it's been done for years\nAnd it used to be that the worst thing that would happen in this situation is that a someone would be banned from the NC double a a coach who was who was caught um funneling money or or some middle man\nNow it's like ... which is which is a step at\nAbsolutely now you could possibly go behind bars which is uh what these uh these three men are facing\nWhat you have these three men facing that you say um but I Want to your colleague at the Washington Post Sally Jenkins room recently that the real defended here should be a university but the universities are actually considered victims and all of this do you see at the same way that she does I\nI don't see it that way but that was the way that the federal government decided to get involved in this basically they said that the ... universes were being defrauded 'em by this system\nAh because by funneling this money um two players are are players families um these people knew that they were making these players in eligible\nUnder NCWA rules and therefore that at some point\nIt would all be found out and they wouldn't be allowed to play to the universities that have given them scholarships\nAnd therefore they had to fraud at the universities of of value which is a very strange thing to me because I still don't know how that's fraud I mean universities or a university basketball programs and football programs are still going to get these talented players\nUnder they're very um a low level of remuneration a for athletic talent that brings them um tens of million dollars in revenue every year\nWhich speaks to what you said this is
