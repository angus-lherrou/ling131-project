quite well which is that Democrats had a big advantage and Republicans got a little bit of a bomb to try to close that gap but there's still a significant advantage for Democrats\nAlthough one of our our polls that NPR showed that Republicans when a long way and closing that energy gap I mean it it it sounds like Democrats might have some work to do to to sort of why men death again what what what

talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about a month or month\nAway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he became the first Chinese head of Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under\nLeader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt would escape China\nBut as it turns out among himself is hell under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\n[noise] we'll try to government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how to attention unfolded has come from his wife grace among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nights suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported and missing the French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own France

because she's received threats and is under protection by French police well\nWhen she talks there about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared\nAbout the government's anti corruption campaign was launched by shooting paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and it smeared hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julian Kong highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing month from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol well even\nBefore this happened China's use of it or a poll and amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted to issue a red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists readers are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\n\nAcross the

questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology\nFrom Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff Jeff standard likes that system he's in Lewiston in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on so their stuff we're going to be half of war or taking and their belts were going to be trained together so you're walking down the line it's kind of like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better for everyone\nNow we can take 'em right in the back and put 'em in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera and they're our conversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em uh because uh uh watching everybody get up and go in front of the screen and it's either yes or a nose or you know you couldn't Sunni to\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nShot explain to the judge what happened and they told me to be quite\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison lawyer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national\nLegal aid and defender association and says the increase\nAnd that it alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtrooms from my client unless my clients and shoulder to shoulder to me\nWhile there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\nYou're listening to Rhode Island public radio good morning It's Tuesday October night say and still to come this morning Google
