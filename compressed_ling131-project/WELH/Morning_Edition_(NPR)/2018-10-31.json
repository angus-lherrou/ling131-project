D.\nDot org\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin to morning we are just days away from the mid term election and President Trump has laid his bets on immigration as the issue that will drive Republicans to the polls\nOr at least his hardcore supporters late last week the administration reportedly floated the idea of an executive order that would bar all migrants including those seeking asylum from entering the United states at the southern border then came the announcement on Monday to the Pentagon is deploying more than five thousand troops to the border and then yesterday\nCame the idea of scrapping a key piece of the fourteenth amendment what's known as birthright citizenship through an executive order\nHow ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits she ... she was just and it has to end\nUp all of false statements their most notably that the United states is one of more than thirty notions with birthright citizenship\nAlso worth noting overturning a constitutional amendment is really really difficult ... is an NPR White House correspondent and co host of the politics podcast and joins us now get money damn good morning so is the president's anti immigrant message something that resonates with Republicans writ large or is this about really what Steve said his personal basis for\nIt it is the number one issue for Republicans the Kaiser Family foundation or has a poll out that that finds that if you ask Republican voters their top issue note and twenty five percent of them which is the highest of any issue will say immigration is their number one issue\nIt's not nearly as salient with Democrats or with independents said this is about Republicans and this is in particular about Trump Republicans this is an issue that President Trump has has felt worked for him and and he hopes will be able to transfer to candidates he supports he\nFelt that really worked for him in the Republican primary in twenty sixteen\nAnd I guess we should just note the way the politics and the media work you can say something wildly impractical completely irrelevant not that important caravan caravan birthright citizenship and even if it's not very practical it focuses attention focuses the mind on the issue that the president wants people to be thinking\nAnd the un unless he perceives to be a threat and positioning him\nWe also get support from Rhode Island is harmless

polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I think so too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my aunts my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics oh we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the other kids who go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to\nVoice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not\nEvil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me\nAnd believing that there is another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the rights that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nAn issue that hits very close to home I have personally express\nBut in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence that forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you'll hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered [noise]\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and\nBecause it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio\nAnd I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism\nElectric ruin thank you so much for talking with us thank you and\nListening to the public radio and you noted for

election they address issues including transgender rights and the Citizens United Supreme Court decision on campaign finance\nFor more on all this we're joined this morning by Scott McKay political analyst for the public radio and Michael Goodman director of the public policy center at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth\nGreat to have you here thanks for having me Scott the other question that generated the most publicity is question one which would limit the number of patients who could be assigned to a hospital nurses\nThese limits is supported by nurses unions but there are strenuously opposed by hospital management's now the nurses say the limits are needed to protect patients but the hospitals say approval this measure would increase health care costs substantially how to use sort this out uh with great\nDifficulty Scott there's a lot of dispute about the basic facts of this one with the proponents of question one coming out saying except for the ball and it's necessary for patient safety and the opponents claiming that it'll put undue pressure on our community hospitals\nThe state health policy commission recently came out with a an assessment that seems to lean more towards the no side that it would be very expensive and it would lead to a number of unintended consequences that community hospitals\nI think a lot of the voters are confused about where to go on this one and the race has been tightening up if you look at the public polling\nObviously there's been millions and millions of dollars spent on both sides of this other states with the exception of California are really don't have these kinds of laws now I understand that the big Boston Worcester teaching hospitals\nComply with many of the staffing provisions on nurses but you mentioned the smaller community hospitals and they don't\nAllow the community folks say that this could lead to really deluding we're care or even perhaps closing them is this an alarmist thing we're pushing or is there some truth to the\nI think there is some truth to it we we have and we have had for some time a shortage of nurses in the marketplace in Massachusetts and so it's hard to produce additional nurses on demand these Boston teaching hospitals have a lot of market power and we're going to be able to pay up\nTo recruit nurses to meet these new staffing ratios and I think there is concern that some of the community hospitals will have a hard time competing\nQuestion too would appoint a commission that would advocate for constitutional amendments related to political spending now this has been pushed in the post Citizens United era to tighten campaign spending and political donor reporting what are the locations of this question well\nIs an advisory question that would form a commission that would investigate a constitutional amendment to overturn effectively Citizens United and uh to declare that corporations are not people and therefore don't have the free speech rights\nThat allow them to do the kind of political campaign finance that has been a concern for some I think it would be the first step in a very long term process of attempting to amend the national constitution the public polling suggests\nIs it realistic for one state to try to drive rules that could clash with the U.S Supreme Court decision which of course stripped away those Watergate era federal campaign spending limits\nWell this is how you go about changing the constitution and we'll start with an advisory and start with somebody either a constitutional convention or bill in Congress this is one way to get that conversation started now how realistic is it to imagine in this environment you're going to change the national constitution that's another question but I think\nThis is part of I'm sure a long term conversation about how to make changes to the constitution in an environment where the national legislature and the Supreme Court aren't inclined to\nThe other referendum would repeal state laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity I Know the transgender community is where he's a vigorous campaign against this one well\nThat the transgender community their allies an overwhelming majority of the residents of Massachusetts the leaders in our legislature and our governor has all come out yes\nOn this question it's a little bit confusing or it's the question actually is framed in a way that say shall we keep the law or so the answer for those who wants to continue to allow transgender individuals to have rights\nThe wheeler

a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to our first listener so I don't get paid by Soros or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her fired use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another\nElectrodes and the elite class in general again a bias Trump has personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest\nTalk about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite\n\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection he wants to win\nAnd he has a special talent of knowing how\nTo appeal to the resentments hatred of is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy somebody who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms with they can find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidents has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not just for the holidays from member station WBFO easy in Chicago Suzie on reports\nAt a pop up Halloween store in downtown Chicago shoppers are trying on math sword\nFighting with Tom\nThis used to be a lens rafters for a few weeks around Halloween Chicago costume company is bringing the shop back when the dead Halloween shopping is big business it's expected to generate nine billion dollars this year and pop shops are all about getting some of that retail dollar Courtland ... general manager of Chicago costume\nAnd people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition and getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords ... short term leases that is the short with commercial real estate service jail allows says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a lamb or to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they tracked families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stories may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it one company helping them ...\nIf it's like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed ... says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich is you know so the push coming from ... regret and we walked in the ... and we've seen a lot of celebrities you know like fingers homers function of their own brand\nHe says record labels have even set up pop up centered around a specific artist oh washed as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year and entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're catching the traditional model of long term is then you're missing it by a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up and it turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution ... right now the short term is than your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher writes in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases NPR News I'm Suzie on in Chicago\nSurveying Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts good morning as soon as the public's radio eighty

what you read the amendment right and I think you I I'm pretty certain I Know you're misinterpreting the central cause subject to the jurisdiction era that does not mean simply\nA that you're subject

believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on ...\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you'll hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on strictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of that democratic checked boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you taught your family about your about your evolution\nI have [laughter] than avoiding it you know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them

point three FM good morning I'm ... in Providence\nMassachusetts voters will decide three ballot questions in next week's election they address issues including transgender rights and the Citizens United Supreme Court decision on campaign finance\nFor more now we're joined this morning by Scott and Kate political analyst for the public radio and Michael Goodman director of the public policy center at the University of Massachusetts ... ... it's\nGreat to have you here thanks for having me Scott your other question that generated the most publicity is question one which would limit the number of patients who could be assigned to a hospital nurses these limits are supported by nurses unions but they're strenuously opposed by hospital management\nTo protect patients but the hospitals say approval this measure would increase health care costs substantially how do you sort this out uh with great\nDifficulty Scott there's a lot of dispute about the basic facts of this one with the proponents of question one coming out saying except for the ball and it's necessary for patient safety and the opponents claiming that it'll put undue pressure on our community hospitals\nThe state health policy commission recently came out with a an assessment that seems to lean more towards the no side that it would be very expensive and it would lead to a number of unintended consequences that community hospitals\nI think a lot of the voters are confused about where to go on this one and the race has been tightening up if you look at the public\nPolling obviously there's been millions and millions of dollars spent on both sides of this other states with the exception of California really don't have\nThese kind of laws now I understand that the big Boston Worcester teaching hospitals comply with many of the staffing provisions on nurses but you mentioned the smaller community hospitals and they don't\nA lot of the community folks say that this could lead to really deluding their care or even perhaps closing them is this an alarmist thing we're pushing or is this some for for the I think\nThere is some truth to it we we have and we have had for some time a shortage of nurses in the marketplace in Massachusetts and so it's hard to produce additional nurses on demand these Boston teaching hospitals have a lot of market power and we're going to be able to pay up\nTo recruit nurses to meet these new staffing ratios and I think there is concern that some of the community hospitals will have a hard time competing\nQuestion too would appoint a commission would advocate for causes it to all amendments related to political spending now\nThis has been pushed in the post Citizens United era to tighten campaign spending and political donor reporting what are the locations of his question well this is an advisory\nQuestion that would form of commission that would investigate a constitutional amendment to overturn effectively Citizens United and uh to declare that corporations are not people and therefore don't have the free speech rights\nThat allow them to do the kind of political campaign finance that has been a concern for some I think it would be the first step in a very long term process of attempting to amend the national constitution the public polling suggest it will pass overwhelmingly\nYou know I Wonder though is it realistic for one state to try to drive rules that could clash with the U.S Supreme Court decision which of course stripped away those Watergate era federal campaign spending limits well\nThis is how you go about changing the constitution and we'll start with an advisory to start with somebody either a constitutional convention or bill in Congress this is one way to get that conversation started now how realistic is it to imagine in this environment you're going to change the national constitution that's another question but I think\nThis is part of I'm sure a long term conversation about how to make changes to the constitution in an environment where the national legislature and the Supreme Court aren't inclined to\nThe other referendum would repeal state laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity I Know the transgender community has waged a vigorous campaign against this one\nThat the transgender community their allies an overwhelming majority of the residents of Massachusetts the leaders in our legislature and our governor has all come out yes\nOn this question it's a little bit confusing or it's the question actually is framed in a way that says shall we keep the law or so the answer for those who wants to continue to allow transgender individuals to have rights\nNeed to say yes I'm ... so there is some concern that there might be some confusion on the part of voters when they get into the ballot box but I'm the public polling suggests that when you explain the question clearly the overwhelming majority of our voters will vote to a ...\nStarkly Massachusetts has not been a state better than ... in a lot of these kind of bathroom fights and the things that we see in the red says\nYes I mean look I think this is a a view of the opposition or the the folks who will vote now\nHave a a series of concerns they had those concerns when the law was originally passed two years ago\nThere were claims made about of safety and vulnerability in public places in the showers the locker room we've had zero incidence here in Massachusetts and I think there is a small but significant segment of the population that is really put off by this but\nIt should the wheel or

understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are Moe level it out to control the world Jeffrey her for his story at at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of arguments a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful an enormously\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to a person so I don't get paid by Soros or somebody that\nA rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana now George ...\nVoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel but Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says his deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest me\nYou know we're talking about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite\n\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThe danger for the Jews is that we are a very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and he has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection he wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how\nTo appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms and what they can find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply\nOver the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas

pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using
