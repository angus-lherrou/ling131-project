just how much further is the Federal Bureau of investigation supposed to look into the life of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that's become a hotly debated question after the Senate allowed an extra week to interview witnesses Republican Senator Jeff flake was the one who forced us change he called for a short pause to allow a limited one week FBI investigation that sexual assault accusations against the Supreme Court nominee\nFlake worked with Democrats who were trying to stave off an immediate confirmation vote flake appeared on CBS the sixty minutes along with Democrat Chris Coons an anchor Scott Kelly asked this question\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to apply to the committee nominations over those type of things do\nA lot of testimony to examine NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here in the morning the morning Steve so where does the nomination stand today\nWell one thing we know is that Donald Trump is still all in at a rally in West Virginia over the weekend he cast\nTheir vote for or against judge Kavanaugh in purely partisan terms here's what he said\nSo some great things are happening but a vote for judge Kavanaugh is also a vote to reject the ruthless and outrages tactics of the Democratic party mean obstruction is mainly sisters for the last Eighteen months\nSo there is some confusion however about what exactly is going to be investigated the Senate Judiciary committee said the investigation would be limited to quote current credible allegations so what does that mean\nIs the investigation going to look into the accuracy of Kavanaugh's testimony that's unclear Donald Trump has denied that he's put any limitations on the FBI he said the investigators have free reign but this is not a criminal probe it's merely an additional background checks so they're not going to be issuing any subpoenas well\nLet's listen to a little bit more of what the president has been saying about this\nHaving the FBI go out to a thorough

was the highest death toll and more than forty years\nAnd hundreds of thousands of people were hospitalized William Schaffner is medical director at the national foundation for infectious

for a cheaper health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow\nThis is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met some people\nHave something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults

joins us now from the Kurdish city of ...\nGene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control\nBut the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people and it looks like that party at least will do well\nHere's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nDemocracy not just one of the TV limited reality but fortunately Disney fought using walkers and make it so you get the ... inside of the most almost lost huh\nAnd by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to ... was turn out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears is almost been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in the very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations\nAnd we were able to watch them starts to count some of the ballots so there is an election officials taking out each page her valid because they decided not to do the automated ballot counting teachers they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very gory is process so even at this approved polling station which you think would be like super squeaky clean there were people aren't getting fake IDs and but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nSo I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between\nThe Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum\nThe majority of Kurds said yes\nSo the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that the Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all quite up in the air but um yeah\nA lot of challenges ahead for whatever

been floating over the NAFTA which is a fundamental trade agreement for the U.S Canada and Mexico a sin floating over that agreement for the last two years\nAnd based upon early reports of what's been agreed or Canada got it pretty much what it was looking for in terms of this update\nOr it has the chapter Nineteen review of by National Review of anti dumping countervailing duty\nIt had has gotten

Trudeau nuts that goes on attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways they're more effective targets\nFascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about ...\nWell before this artist made their discoveries catch her treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up this entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world immunotherapy is no really the driving force behind drug development\nThese right I mean we hear a lot about immunotherapy how effective are these new therapies that's what everyone really wants to know if it weren't\nAnd that's an evolving issue it in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies a failed\nAnd some people have had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular but it's also the case that they are not mature for most of the patient to take these drugs\nBut researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of cancer research but clearly there's a lot more to do\nThis is not the end of the story OK NPR science correspondent Richard Harris does Nobel winners thank you so much my pleasure It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm ...

new regional parliament\nThis part of Iraq has been semi autonomous since the U.S led a no fly zone there in the Nineteen nineties to protect the Kurds from former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\nAnd post you interrupt joins us now from the Kurdish city of ... gene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Curtis parliament to look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's going to be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it seemed that young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most fun of people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately for using the walkers and make it so you get the ... inside the multi almost lost huh\nAnd my dad he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to people was turned out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right\nYeah that was a really interesting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears is almost been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there's an election official checking out each paper ballots [noise] because they decided not to do the automated valid counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each party's very laborious process so even a disapproved polling station which you think would be like supers including people trying to get him fake IDs huh but really the question is whether the violations or serious enough to put the results in question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between\nThe Kurdish regional government and the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with that\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a referendum last year saying do you want independence and the vast majority of Kurds said yes so the U.S says of course that it warned them not to hold this and there were serious repercussions after that\nThe Iraqi government sent in tanks so they're going to have to repair relations with Baghdad and a lot of other things on their plate as well the economy is so it's all quite up in the air but um yeah a lot of challenges ahead for whatever emerges from this new government in the next couple of days\nNPR's Jane Arraf in the Kurdish city has to ... thanks so much time we appreciate it thank

much what it was looking for in terms of this update\nOr it has the chapter Nineteen review of by National Review of anti dumping countervailing duty\nIt had has gotten rid of this guillotine clause
