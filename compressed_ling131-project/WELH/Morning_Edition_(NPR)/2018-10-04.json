microcephaly or I'd normally small heads among other impairments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called seek a love story among the people he met there where her Montana so ... she's the head of a support group for parents called the United mothers of angels\nYou are still emotional about this on our ... to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist into the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was I was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims\nTo me when I when I was that\nUm they were very very big either they were very tight group loss of solidarity\nVery determined women some of them I'm wearing gauge didn't you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSay they were quite a strong started women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the anointed mothers of angels [noise]\nUh this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mean I was you know she's one of these people that just\nGive you a look and you sort of just stopped talking a but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year or so I'm ... how are they doing\nThat's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well\nI I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is that there were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what you can talk um\nIs it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achievements that tell me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around [noise]\nIt's an incredibly mixed thing\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the stories twins a girl who was born with a virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this for a job that will go minister bitter issue was cooled uh she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around huh but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect to turn off for a boy to act\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and not another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that Zeke affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what they're going to do about child care and and\nSo we're able to join um the actress ... she went around ... some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil and she was kind of giving talks to these women and giving the pep talks interest sort of saying you know you need to write to the magnates rights to health extreme telling to give you a bus to take your child's school you know just kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning up the issues that they really start to deal with now\n[noise] I Wonder because you have this personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from this chap I did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way\nThe children were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much my ... year ago and holding how it was just like holding my little girl\nAnd her mom was at that point where I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing and then not Eighteen months Katie my daughter has done so much and I really wanted to say to ... she's got to worry she'll come you know\nBut you can't you know you just don't know where

good morning I'm Chuck him in in Providence\nThe supplemental FBI background report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is to be delivered to senators on Capitol Hill this morning\nAnd initial Senate vote on the nomination is set for tomorrow\nRhode Island junior Senator Sheldon Whitehouse joins me this morning to discuss this process he is a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee we spoke by phone from his Washington office and I started by asking him what he hoped would come out of this new FBI report\n[noise] I'm hoping that what will come out of this investigation\nAre facts that people in the Senate kind of agree on\nThat does require a thorough investigation to get there so the first step is to take a look at what the FBI actually did and make sure that it meets the standards of a sincere and thorough investigation\nAt this point do you think the FBI can effectively investigating this a limited amount of time and after a very public Senate committee hearing\n[noise] I think uh they have been constrained by the White House and by the time frame or I think it is possible within that timeframe to devote very significant resources and get a lot done\nI don't know yet what their resources were that they are dedicated to this investigation whether they ran down corroborating leaves\nSo I Would say it is possible within the timeframe to do a sincere and thorough job if adequate resources are deployed but it's far from certain\nSenator white has she been kind of mocked for focusing your questions on specific details of Kavanaugh's high school yearbook in the high school calendar during the committee hearing you regret this line of questioning at all\n[laughter] not a bit I think that um given the constraints that we had of evidence there is very very little that survives from the timeframe in which the alleged assault occurred\nAnd so understanding risk Kavanaugh's own words from that time frame I think is elementary lawyering\nAnd to that in some journalists in some members of the public ... have been raising questions about several of Kavanaugh's responses during the hearing including to some of your questions\nWhat do you make of the allegation that Kavanaugh may have lied about the meeting of terms like devil's triangle he told you that was a drinking game although others have suggested it has a more salacious meaning\nIt does not seem credible and I have a scene the public and press reporting that his definitions of those words do not seem consistent with anybody else's definition\nIt's not particularly relevant except to the extent that it bears on his conduct and his state of mind\nTrade himself Senator Whitehouse do you believe he's telling the truth when he says he's innocent of the allegations of sexual misconduct I\nBelieved that Dr Ford\nAnd she said that she was one hundred percent certain a better was Brett Kavanaugh who assaulted her are taught her testimony was very credible I I'm surprised that the FBI is not speaking to her but I Believe her\nDoctor for Dr Christine Blasey Ford made her testimony at the committee and then we heard from Brett Kavanaugh very fiery testimony\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse that you're running for reelection and your opponent has accused you of furthering the false allegation against Kavanaugh involving an incident on a boat in

a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is a stadium that ISIS use to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now\nHow is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nBoth Steve Rogers seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for another streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes that have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for help officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and do it\nNow but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly\nTwo hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states the control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nWriting that was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people it it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit\nAnd they still have money to pass around so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much Tom You're

David Greene in Culver City California this morning inside the secure room at the U.S Capitol senators on the Judiciary Committee are getting a chance\nTo read a single copy of an FBI report this is the result of the agencies supplemental investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault when he was younger than the majority leader Mitch McConnell said last night we should say before he read the report that the first vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation is going to take place tomorrow\nThere'll be plenty of time for members review and be briefed on the supplemental material\nBefore friday cloture vote\nSo I'm falling cloture on judge Kavanaugh's nomination this evening so the process can move forward\nI Want to bring in NPR's Ryan Lucas who has been following this story morning Ryan good morning so let's start with the FBI investigation itself I mean this was never supposed to actually draw conclusions about these allegations against Kavanaugh writing me remind us what additional information the Senate was hoping to to get from this supplemental background check as they're calling it\nWell the answer to that question kind of depends on whether you're a Republican or Democrat so what Republicans wanted was for the FBI to focus on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations a and a second allegation from Deborah Ramirez about sexual misconduct\nOr that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's ah her story is that a Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when they were both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nDemocrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the alleged incidents but the key thing to remember here is that\nUh the White House is the one in control of the background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House the president controls the parameters and the president has said while he's fine if the FBI talks to anybody out there that he was providing direction to the FBI based off of what Senate Republicans wanted\nOkay well then I mean given all of that do we know what the scope was like who the F we actually spoke to\nWe don't know specifically what the scope was but I've been able to confirm six people that the FBI talked to was part of this or the bulk of the FBI's work appears to be focused on Ford's allegations\nAnd at Providence picture frame find framing since the Eighteen hundreds now offering your car or art

Catalina ... and and is friends with horse and two members of the Swedish Academy which award the Nobel Prize in literature earlier this week or no was sentenced to two years in prison after being

top of that there were reports of Russians in leaking names of winters to our know allowing him to win some gambling money\nWhen all of this came to like ... and an angle refused to step down so three members of the academy left in protest and permanent secretary ... was not just out here she is talking to a ... after she stepped\nDown April it's already affected the Nobel Prize quite severely I'm not [noise] it's a real debate because\nBeing a member of the Swedish Academy is a lifetime appointment you can't leave the most you can do is not participate the Swedish Cancun intervene it's kind of a mess of a situation that brown says\nThe Swedish Academy which declined to comment for this story\nI think it's certainly damages the east coast of the academy unassuming question you know how well it'll recover\nOutlook yeah there is a professor of English at George Mason university who's taught a class a Nobel Prize winning novels he thinks the academy might be better served with a more international jury\nAnd out with things like the Supreme Court and so on there's problems with lifetime appointments in general\nAnd he points out that there are other literary awards in fact one

News I'm\nRachel Martin and I'm David Greene and we're going to visit rocket now it was once the capital of ISIS territory in Syria but it was captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nUnder the soccer stadium right in downtown rock and this is the stadium that ISIS use to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now how\nIs the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nFor Steve a rocket seems to be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps\nAnd more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need\nFor health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basics\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive the street so completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war\nAnd now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though they're still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nWhite and it was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty\nPercent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wondering is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead there what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money they had to basically stop some of the programs here in rocker\nSearches bomb removal but also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars\nTo the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide\nPeople with the basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass round so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much for your workers do [noise]\nMorning that says Rhode Island public radio some great reporting there from Tom Bowman and Rocca about what is happening in the city right now what families are doing as they
