something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb near ... and\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test bend a pain\nCall a phony um they tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put into a tiny plastic hassle than they do a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSaid that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand

that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for a lobby the fitting a five star hotel me not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to her co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look

allergy tests\nApril Dembosky has the story [noise]\nWhen Janet Winston goes to the doctor she feels up on gas impacts the sandwich and to the services of laughed and that's what I Need to make the three hundred mile ride Winston as an English professor in rural eureka California\nWhen she needs to see a specialist she often drive six hours one way to Stanford healthcare just south of San Francisco\nI had this rash that wouldn't go away she got that rash last winter ever horseback riding and it lasted four months it was itchy and like meet the like poison oak\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb new ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test bends of pain\nCall a phony um they tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found and beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it\nWinston left and then came back two days later\nAnd they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out when I was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needles stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck and me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know that a ... engine does it have the top of the line Bluetooth stereo system or does it have the more comfortable seats we want to know or paying for it and here we don't have any of the\nWinston insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than the station is being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'll be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr they're reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station kick you do\nLook at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive though Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby a forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\nA yeah it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was\nPart of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means they're few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars
