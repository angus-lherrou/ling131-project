management did she\nKnow and kitty ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was a man named Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the area of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his scope of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we asked the and something that we've reported their responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my lord and intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd heritage but she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you\nIn a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says you know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nHer organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the Chinese leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've ...\nView this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution and any other context\nIn Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like the local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local the local donor community I think I'm On the local community had the sense of\nA lot of people have a feeling that something has gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit than these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids

Steve Inskeep and I'm Noel King\nMore than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go on the streets selling herself I don't live in years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly it's fun to recoup the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAbout social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small step are making a difference\nSo who is Katie my other why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had a long background in doing various forms of yeah community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued our relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditch you\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own\nPromotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told you must be thought he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my either and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my life had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents\nWas many many girls and more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in the court those who actually are willing to bring a case they were to be tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because\nA bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says you know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nHer organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we have from the Chinese leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community the sense of\nA lot of people had a feeling that something had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well up more technical stuff like well how do we are both our process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie
