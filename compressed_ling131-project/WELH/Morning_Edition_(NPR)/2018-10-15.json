Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well he\nDoes but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all of these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different um\nWhat he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and\nDriven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's outta versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington D. C. is the back stabbing the duplicitous and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this well he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich likes most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is um or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what ...\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and have kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and I and that's how he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome the kickoff and thanks so much for coming in thank you and this is NPR News\nServing Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts this is the public radio eighty nine point three ... still to come this morning President Trump was on sixty minutes last night a recap of that conversation coming up to six or seven\nDishes the public radio eighty nine point three ... six o'clock\nWho good morning when asked about the reality of climate change President Trump's reframe his skepticism dropped his claim of a hoax that without evidence\nThat climate will change back It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nHe doesn't want to spend too much money to fix it and\nI'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep in this hour we have two stories of trade bourbon makers and the red state of Kentucky prepare for punishment terrorists\nCloser to leaving the European Union without any replacement trade deal\nAlso what happens when corporate CEOs take a stand on political issues is Monday or over Fifteen\nTen years ago today there was a presidential debate Democrats rock Obama Republican\nThe news is next\nLife from NPR News in Washington I'm core of a cold and then President Trump is scheduled to view hurricane damage in Florida and Georgia today at least Seventeen people are known dead in four states because of the storm but dozens of others are still missing mostly in Florida\nAuthorities caution these maybe people who fled the hurricane but haven't been able to check in with loved ones or return to see their homes Adrian well he has the city clerk for Mexico Beach Florida where hurricane Michael made landfall\nBecause we'd for much return on fuel gasoline\n... toilets a cell phone service is a huge thing\nIt could be several weeks before power is restored to badly damaged areas meanwhile rescuers are using heavy equipment and dogs to search rubble in many areas the Florida Panhandle for victims\nIconic retailers Sears has filed for bankruptcy today the American auto center hardware appliance and clothing store missed a one hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment NPR's Emily Sullivan has more Sears was the\nMost well known mail order catalogue company up the Nineteen and twenty centuries for decades it sold everything from diamonds watches and cars to homes historian Jerry Hancock remembers it to prominence\nFears taught America or about the modern world through this catalog\nToday it's five point five billion dollars in debt it was a long march to the end the company has seen store closures and tumbling stock in recent years I met a constantly changing retail landscape dominated by Amazon e commerce and big box discount retailers\nIt's chapter eleven filing allows the company to reorganize and perhaps emerged from bankruptcy was some of its businesses still alive Emily Sullivan NPR News Saudi\nArabia continues to deny it was involved in the disappearance of possible murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal ...

looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr if the point where it's it's more than ... percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably are global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales while\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\nFrom the store to store but yes the I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements with a well a NAFTA\nYou're as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know you have distilleries are starting to look at what happens if this starts escalating and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nAnd well ah we don't like the options on the table\nThis is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people who have converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different\nWays out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid hey we obviously this is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot of that um when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much ah it come up as an\nIssue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSet up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in and he told us he understood exactly did this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thinks that I guess it's the federal law writers they federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike you know highly David sandwich announced it can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in\nAmerica and if you want to sell you better make any concessions\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a yeah I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from my standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back\nTo drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations Eric\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total that damage damage from hurricane Michael which hit Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable rather than non functional phones made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster\nWater just on the outskirts of products or ... miles across\n... networks and the fried division of power hill Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught ... sitting on the Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nBut its situation like that every all that ... that decided to look at it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas for the last generation of temper poultry farms are hit pretty hard and the car industry is devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster without insurance in Alabama he's been working in eastern county\nCotton was ready to make it last week and a six\nOr what but last April source of income\nSo lovely to early estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but it's also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from having coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damage is upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything\nBack to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you know

Sable Smith reports\nCurly hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not to somebody who's health you know in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out I was\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of around\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nI Know you've got a message or haven't come up and running out and not much\nStill have a call but by and large ... who was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had it too but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCharlie was putting to medically induced coma for over a week his father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors are worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat\nI basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this\nFrom the flu it's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard his doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu age a lack of immunity\nFor Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the flu you likely get a milder case\nThings to get better for Charlie eventually he left the hospital and spent three weeks rehabbing in a nursing home the same one where his grandmother was being treated for advanced dementia\nWhich was not an experience I expected but L. to family members that came to visit got a two for you know they got to visit her and me\nOn April sixteenth two days before his thirty ninth birthday he got out of the nursing home and went to his home for the first time in three months he started driving again in may working part time in June got back to the office in August but the experience was still\nNine at him I was laying awake at nights I'm Still kind of trying to process what I'd gone through this year or so I took to Twitter to share that and and use my story is as an example of this is why you should get a flu shot\nSlowly life is returning to normal for Charlie except for one thing in September for the first time he can remember he got a flu shot for NPR News I'm Bram Sable Smith\nIf you step on the sidewalk outside the NPR

same time we're seeing a rise in injuries but we also see that people are getting out of their car and potentially helping to relieve congestion you know is that a trade off from a public agency standpoint but we think is a good one I don't know we don't know yet\nPortland of course does not want the rise and injuries they're handing out free helmets and doing a public education campaign\nBut you only have to look at the ... going by to see that this is a big change cars and scooters are still learning how to be around each other and not many people are wearing helmets cities and

Trump says the ...\nThe disappearance and alleged murder of journalists ... the president told sixty minutes that is the top leadership in Saudi Arabia is responsible there will be severe punishment Saudi Arabia continues to deny any involvement and said that if the U.S imposes sanctions it will retaliate\nThis was one subject covered in a wide ranging interview that aired on CBS last night with President Trump NPR's White House correspondent Ayesha Rascoe joins us now Corning\nGood morning so Turkish investigators say a democracy Yogi was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be a Saudi has proven to have been behind us he\nDid not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action\nBut he said that that is not a what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take a strong\nAction and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be\nYes so this was also in this interview the first

I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described your product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources or the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lumps don't show though I Am so she'll\nFilters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about a hundred twenty six centuries\nAt this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export markets\nWhere it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're you probably are global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales as well and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increased ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nasty and the EU agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like the options on the table\nThis is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nCity we obviously is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot could ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much ah it\nCome up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has to wake them up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he said the meeting with\nThe vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what Barbies Kentucky or heat will note for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes ah in in he he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here\nIn America and if you want to sell you better make sneaking check\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been a a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears\nIs that all these scotch drinkers or that we converted over the last ... years suddenly if they started looking from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations Eric\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael ...
