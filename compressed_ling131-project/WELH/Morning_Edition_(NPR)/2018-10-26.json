John Bender introduces these outsider candidates and their long shot bids for executive office\nTheir funding pales in comparison to the front runners they've got no major party support they have a little to NO NAME recognition and they want to be governor\nI Love Rhode Island this is home and I'm disgusted by what's been happening the last few years where it seems like we're getting sold out\nI Believe that we need a social safety net but I also believe it needs to be a balanced\nBudget so those are the questions that I'm asking is not whether I as an individual can make it worked in Rhode Island but can most Rhode islanders make it work in Rhode Island\nThat's an Armstrong William Gilbert and Louis Daniel Munoz each gathered enough signatures to get on the November ballot and with plenty of mock seat they're pushing ahead and Armstrong grew up in Rhode Island and believes the state she's known is disappearing\nEverything that was special vote our way of life here one by one by one is being eroded like what like Denny's Denny's turning into box stores like the plus socks going the way\nArmstrong's concerns may sound familiar to many Rhode islanders who like her lament the closure of ... the local chain where residents once shops for bikes tires and lawn furniture but Armstrong is far from a conventional candidates she's a retired engineer who is now the leader of a religious group that believes in using cannabis as part of religious rituals\nThe first time I met her she was standing outside the adult correctional institutions in ... she just made bail after being arrested by state police for possession of more than fifty pounds of marijuana at her west Greenwich home\nSomebody claimed a house melting pot so because of this strong smell of neither neither they started surveilling our property with helicopters apparently for the past few weeks\nThe charges have been sent to a grand jury and could carry a life sentence but Armstrong says her campaign isn't stopping\nActually it's energized my campaign and given it um direction focus in momentum\nArmstrong is running as a member of the compassion party on a platform that includes decriminalization of marijuana and the tax incentive program to encourage private investment into health care education and affordable housing she says she understands summer for views are outside the mainstream and that she likely won't win the race\nBut if I get my message out\nAnd people implement my ideas I don't they don't have to give me credit and I don't have to sit there and be in charge\nModerate party candidate William Gilbert is on his own uphill climb for the governor's office driving in his car Gilbert explains the moderate party platform the Fort ease as he calls them education [noise]\nAh the economy the environment and ethics and all the social issues the moderate party decided to lead to the individual candidate you don't have to be fully ally [noise] that I liked that idea\nGilbert a busy guy these days we're driving around the state two properties he's rehabbing as part of his real estate business he also works fulltime at electric boat and Groton, Connecticut he's getting an MBA and now he's campaigning for\nGovernor the executive office that's where the rubber meets the road is that we implement this as the blocking and tackling\nGilbert grew up in Florida where he worked hard as uh\nPolitics by attending local school committee meetings while still in high school he joined a local Republicans when he moved to North kings down where he's still lives but he became dissatisfied with the party including its leaders support for trimming social welfare programs\nYou know a lot of Republicans you know if you're going to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and they don't recognize that there are people that can't they don't have no bootstraps\nSo he joined the Democrats for a time before to camping to the moderate party Gilbert says he wants to boost the economy with the low state sales tax and expand vocational training but he also believes that government can get in the way Gilbert points to the amount of time it's taking for a developer to overcome opposition to a new skyscraper in Providence as an example\nI think the economy even be better if it didn't take five years to get a permit for something yet the faint tower the guy wants to come in advance almost a billion dollars and we say no we don't want to do spot zoning but don't do spot zoning laws on the whole street for high rises\nGilbert concedes he's unlikely to become governor but he believes he's providing and needed alternative to what he thinks he's a broken two party system\nBut I Do think that people are waiting for that person or rally behind it might that guy I don't know\nLewis Daniel Munoz hopes he is that guy he's also running for governor but has no party affiliation\nSo politically here's why where I stand it I don't vote based on party Ivo based on individuals\nAnd Munoz says the individuals representing the major parties and the Rhode Island governor's race aren't doing enough to address major problems such as health care and education\nMunoz says he wants to reduce the cost of health insurance expand community health programs and make community service a regular part of public school he also talks a lot about providing opportunities to people who don't have them Munoz says he and his siblings struggled growing up in Central Falls\nBecause my mother was really working hard but still financially struggling we're having bags of chips and twenty five cent juices for dinner for weeks on end\nMunoz made it to Rhode Island college then medical school before entering the medical device industry with his inspiring personal story he would seem an ideal candidate for a mainstream political party but\nMunoz says joining a party boxes you and he also criticizes the media including the public's radio for giving his campaign so little attention\nThere seems to be a system built around keeping outsiders out and it's not a system that voters except I just think that many voters don't understand that it's their\nMunoz bristles at people who suggest he run for a lower office to get more experience in politics before making a bid for governor he believes he's demonstrating courage in running\nThat type of courage is I Believe what we need in Rhode Island it isn't enough to be intellectual\nIt isn't enough to acknowledge that a problem exist you have to have the courage to [noise]\nTo see a problem and to to engage it and to and to find any way possible to resolve it\nThe most recent poll of the Rhode Island governor's race by the public's radio the Providence Journal and ABC six shows Munoz Gilbert and Armstrong

dangerous mail packages in the past\nAnd how that's informing this current probe\nJoining us now is NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre yeah great well All right so the government is putting a lot of resources into this investigation at this is not the first at type of investigation or investigation of this sort in the countries of recent history what have investigators learned from those those earlier probes\nWell the first of all we know these are relatively rare going all the way back to Nineteen Seventy they've just been fifty seven package bombs and twenty three additional cases of dangerous materials like anthrax or rice and um these figures come from the start consortium which studies terrorism at the at the University of Maryland\nBeen fewer than twenty

for executive office\nTheir funding pales in comparison to the front runners they've got no major party support they have a little to NO NAME recognition and they want to be governor\nI Love Rhode Island this is home and I'm disgusted by what's been happening the last few years where it seems like we're getting sold out\nI Believe that we need a social safety net but I also believe it needs to be a balanced budget\nSo those are the questions that I'm asking it's not whether\nI as an individual can make it worked in Rhode Island but can most Rhode islanders make it work and Rhode Island\nThat's an Armstrong William Gilbert and Louis Daniel Munoz each gathered enough signatures to get on the November ballot and with plenty of mock seat they're pushing ahead and Armstrong grew up in Rhode Island and believes the state she's known is disappearing\nEverything that was special vote our way of life here one by one by one is being eroded like what like Denny's like like then he's turning into box stores like the plus socks going away\nArmstrong's concerns may sound familiar to many Rhode islanders who like her lament the closure of ... the local chain where residents once shopped for bikes tires and lawn furniture but Armstrong is far from a conventional candidates she's a retired engineer who is now the leader of a religious group that believes in using cannabis as part of religious rituals\nThe first time I met her she was standing outside the adult correctional institutions in ... she just made bail after being arrested by state police for possession of more than fifty pounds of marijuana at her west credits home\nSomebody claimed a house smelled like pot so because of this strong smell of neither neither they started surveilling our property with helicopters apparently for the past few weeks\nThe charges have been sent to a grand jury and could carry a life sentence but Armstrong says her campaign isn't stopping\nActually it's energized my campaign and giving it um direction focus in momentum\nArmstrong is running as a member of the compassion party on a platform that includes decriminalization of marijuana and the tax incentive program to encourage private investment into health care education and affordable housing she says she understands summer for views are outside the mainstream and that she likely won't win the race\nBut if I get my message out\nAnd people implement my ideas I don't they don't have to give me credit and I don't have to sit there and be in charge\nModerate party candidate William Gilbert is on his own

the state two properties he's rehabbing as part of his real estate business he also works fulltime at electric boat and Groton, Connecticut he's getting an MBA and now he's campaigning for\nGovernor the executive office that's where the rubber meets the road is that we implement this is the blocking and tackling\nGilbert grew up in Florida where he worked hard as a kid to help his family get by he got into politics by attending local school committee meetings while still in high school he joined a local Republicans when he moved to North kings down where he's still lives but he became a dissatisfied with the party including its leaders support for trimming social welfare programs\nYou know a lot of Republicans you know feel you've got to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and they don't recognize that there are people that can't they don't have no bootstraps\nSo he joined the Democrats for a time before to camping to the moderate party Gilbert says he wants to boost the economy with the low state sales tax and expand vocational training but he also believes that\nMm it's taking for a developer to overcome opposition to a new skyscraper in Providence as an example\nI think the economy even be better if it didn't take five years to get a permit for something you have to feign tower guy wants to come and invest almost a billion dollars will be saying no we don't want to do spot zoning but don't do spot zoning laws on the whole street for high rises Gilbert\nConcedes he's unlikely to become governor but he believes he's providing and needed an alternative to what he thinks he's a broken two party system\nBut I Do think that people are waiting for that person or rally behind it might that guy I don't know\nLewis Daniel Munoz hopes he is a bad guy he's also running for governor but has no party affiliation\nSo politically here's why where I stand it I don't vote based on party Ivo based on individuals\nAnd Munoz says the individuals representing the major parties and the Rhode Island governor's race aren't doing enough to address major problems such as health care and education\nMunoz says he wants to reduce the cost of health insurance expand community health programs and make community service a regular part of public school he also talks a lot about providing opportunities to people who don't have them Munoz says he and his siblings struggled growing up in Central Falls\nBecause my mother was really working hard but still financially struggling we're having bags of chips and twenty five cent juices for dinner for weeks on end\nMunoz made it to Rhode Island college than medical school before entering the medical device industry within inspiring personal story he would seem an ideal candidate for mainstream political party but Munoz says joining a party boxes you and he also criticizes the media including the public's radio for giving his campaign so little attention\nThere seems to be a system built around keeping outsiders out and it's not a system that voters except I just think that many voters don't understand that it's their\nMunoz bristles at people who suggest he run for a lower office to get more experience in politics before making a bid for governor he believes he's demonstrating courage in running\nThat type of courage is I Believe what we need in Rhode Island it isn't enough to be intellectual\nIt isn't enough to acknowledge that have problem exist you have to have the courage to\nTo see a problem and to a twin gauge it and to and to find any way possible to resolve it\nThe
