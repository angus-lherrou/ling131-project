take a moment to check on democracy in Afghanistan the country has been planning parliamentary elections this week up most of the voting will proceed but in a very large populous province\nThe voting has been postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top\nPolice chief Pamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um\nThe original plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament from candidates of all all flavors and philosophy is\nA there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of star and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true awe and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to a massive fraud though you said a lot of a positive uh campaigning lot new fresh faces a lot of it is yes\nUh and and and anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different in a week\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously this is a measure taken on an emergency basis um just to to sort of calm things down and kind of hard to very large province which is stuff off\nIt's the least have its intelligence tape and the governor has been gravely wounded um there's acute security vacuum and people are very nervous and worried so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would take and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots and lots of voters but let's let's see what happens tomorrow and let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're
