all of us need help at some point in our lives sometimes at many points in our lives\nOn good days are wish for help is relatively trivial say asking a neighbor to help us move a piece of furniture or a pastor by for driving directions\nAt other times or needs for eight maybe deeper and wider\nSay in the midst of an overwhelming health or parenting crunch and some of us are quick to someone help when we need it with new sense of shame or embarrassment but for others of us asking for help is loaded as if it's a sign of weakness\nSometimes or reticence doesn't much matter but as we hear from Chris mcenroe sometimes it does matter\nA lot\nIt's a man thing I think I Would rather be asked for help and ask\nI see that in the men I Know\nWe seemed to lack the skill of asking for help when we find ourselves and really difficult circumstances that skill that we have so actively not engaged and we have left to rot on the vine from lack of use in practice\nThat skill asking for help is available to us\nOne recent Saturday morning I received news of a friend who had died by driving into a telephone pole he was one of the first people to introduce me to akita martial art I Would continue to study for the next Eighteen years so he left training only if you\nThe occasional visit and I always marveled at a skill he was powerful natural and he seemed to be able to come back once a year and shown no signs of decline\nSo it may be years between get togethers I felt they knew him he was funny irreverent deeply compassionate rebellious and spoke about his family is the focus of his life of creativity in of his curiosity\nThe news of his passing was completely discordant from what I knew\nThe paper reported that he lived in a town I knew he did not live and\nI Hope that meant it with someone else but the paper was correct in both the name and the place\nUnknown to me he had moved because he had gotten divorced he had some personal issues that made him dysfunctional in his relationships he became alienated lonely and despondent\nThe consequence of not asking for help at a critical moment can be immediate and in my friend's case fatal\nAnd so I Believe knowing when and how to ask for help is a skill that should be practiced can you help me can you hold that door can you give me some directions\nI'm In a conflict with someone who means a great deal to me can you give me some advice\nAnd when I don't want to ask for help because I'm too proud or too lazy\nI'm going to think of my powerful friend [noise]\nAnd I'll send that first question\nCan you help me to

Chris Coons of Delaware is one of those Democratic senators and he joined us this morning welcome senator\nThank you David good morning so you were one of only four senators to oppose Nikki Haley's hum confirmation yesterday you said that she has helped move U.S interests forward at the United nations what does change your mind about her well I voted against\n'em then governor Nikki Haley because she had very little virtually no foreign policy experience\nAh and she did not impress me and her confirmation hearing is having the relevant experience to be our lead spokes person at the United nations I after watching her performance engaging with her regularly over several months\nI actually called her and said I made an I'd made a mistake that I thought on human rights and on standing up to Russia She was a bright spot in the Trump administration's foreign policy team\nOf course I disagree with a number of the things that Trump Administration has done in foreign policy and she did carry forward a number of the president's America First initiatives at the un up but she ended up being a much more forceful voice on American values in particular human rights than I initially had expected\nAcknowledging that you made a mistake does that um cause you to approach the next nomination differently I mean Dina Powell was someone who is being talked about she worked in the Bush administration but doesn't have a whole lot more foreign policy experience but that might you give the president a little more difference because you saw what happened with Nikki Haley\nWell
