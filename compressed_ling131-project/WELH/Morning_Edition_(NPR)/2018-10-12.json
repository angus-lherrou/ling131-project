computers weaken let me bring Erin Hi Cokie Hi David okay so the first question is coming from a guy named ... he goes by that name he's in India he tweets at tribute projects and he asked this\nHow do current president's rallies compare in terms of the estimated number of attendees\nTo similar appearances by past presidents\nAre cookies so how did how did the Trump rallies compare but\nLet's just stipulate Donald Trump has enormous rallies and sometimes they're also hundreds sometimes thousands outside trying to get in\nBut it's hard to do a direct comparison because we don't really know how many people showed up and early rallies\nI can tell you that John F. Kennedy had enormous crowds in Nineteen sixty he was constantly straining to fire codes\nOr the night before the election he was at the Boston Garden were twenty two thousand people were estimated to be there I was actually there David and it was terrifying there were so many people as well um but also keep in mind that in early history\nIt was considered unseemly for presidents or presidential candidates to campaign though they did it through surrogates a course which is pretty much what Trump is doing for Republican candidates this year\nWhere there was a time when Kennedy didn't want to campaign\nI Know isn't it doesn't sound restful and you know real but [laughter] but Andrew Johnson when he was president did go out on the campaign trail in Eighteen sixty six campaign against the Republicans in Congress that he thought a word to radical\nIt was called his swing around the circle it backfired totally um it didn't help that he often appeared to be drunk and sometimes fell off the platform of God but it's also true that much of the public and press a thought it was just undignified for the president to engage in that campaign\nWell then the next question comes from someone who uses the Twitter name way to hear this give me a freaking break above that are generally a freaking branded after it was there ever a time when money wasn't an issue it sounds snarky but I'm hoping history has a positive example of where\nIt wasn't that the questions was money ever not so involved\nHate to disappoint give me African break but um basically money's been there since the beginning or we talked recently on one of these talks about how George Washington had wind and dined voters when he was running for the Virginia house of purchases right cause that body to pass the nation's first campaign finance law him\nThe first few presidential campaigns were not particularly a dependent on money uh but that changed with Andrew Jackson and Eighteen twenty eight when he ran much more of a grassroots campaign and then and Eighteen\nNational political convention and of course as you know David political conventions costs money\nAnd that damn and from there on that ah it's

Lexington, Kentucky we're in the sixth congressional district in this state which is one of those that could decide control of the house this fall President Trump campaigns in this district this weekend for the Republican campaigns tonight in Ohio\nCommentator Cokie Roberts answers your questions about our politics and the government work and she spoke with David Greene about campaigning\nYeah the president's constant presence on the campaign trail with our topic was took it as we can let me bring Erin Hi Cokie Hi David okay so the first question is coming from a guy named ... he goes by that name he's in India he tweets at tribute projects and he asked this\nHow do current president's rallies compare in terms of the estimated number of attendees\nDissimilar appearances by past presidents\nAre cookie so how did how did the Trump rallies compare\nLook let's stipulate Donald Trump has enormous rallies and sometimes they are also hundreds sometimes thousands outside trying to get in\nBut it's hard to do a direct comparison because we don't really know how many people showed up it early rallies I can tell you that John F. Kennedy had enormous crowds in Nineteen sixty he was constantly straining to fire codes\nOr the night before the election he was at the Boston Garden were twenty two thousand people were estimated to be there I was actually there David and it was terrifying there were so many people well um but also keep in mind that in early history\nIt was considered unseemly for presidents or presidential candidates to campaign though they did it through surrogates a course which is pretty much what Trump is doing for Republican candidates this year\nWhere there was a time when candidates didn't want to campaign\nI Know isn't it doesn't sound restful and new real but [laughter] Andrew Johnson when he was president did go out on the campaign trail in Eighteen sixty six campaign against the Republicans in Congress that he thought were too radical it was called his swing around the circle it backfired totally\nUm it didn't help that he often appeared to be drunk and sometimes fell off the platform of God but it's also true that much of the public and press a thought it was just undignified for the president to engage in a campaign\nWell then the next question comes from someone who uses the Twitter name with you hear this give me a freaking break above so generally a freaking brand has been was there ever a time when money wasn't an issue it sounds snarky but I'm hoping history has a positive example of where\nIt wasn't the question was money ever not so involved\nI hate to disappoint give me African break let them basically money's been there since the beginning or we talked recently on one of these talks about how George Washington had unwinding dined voters when he was running for the Virginia house of purchases and it caused that body to pass the nation's first campaign finance law him\nThe first few presidential campaigns were not particularly a dependent on money but that changed with Andrew Jackson and Eighteen twenty eight when he ran much more of a grassroots campaign\nAnd then an Eighteen thirty two he was re nominated at the national political convention and of course as you well know David political conventions costs money\nAnd that um and from there on out uh it's basically been Katy bar the door for the rest is history to talk to you nice to be talking with you David\nCokie Roberts with David Greene you can tweet us your questions at
