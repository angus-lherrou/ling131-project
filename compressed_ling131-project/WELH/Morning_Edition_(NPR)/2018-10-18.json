in in Providence\nIn their second debate last I should Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and his Democratic challenger Jake Gonzalez disagreed about transportation education health care and how to pay for it all\nBut their biggest disagreement was over the governor's support for fellow Republican Jeff deal the challenger to Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren\nPolitical reporter Anthony Brooks has that story\nIt was the most contentious moment in last night's debate sponsored by W GBH the moderators asked Baker about a pledge he made a while ago to support the entire Republican ticket which would include Jeff deal\nDeal co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts so this has prompted a bit of a balancing act for bake a moderate Republican with a number of liberal positions who did not vote for Trump Gonzales had a question for the governor is going to vote for Jeff deal\n[noise] governor I'm going to vote for me and I'm going to vote for Karen polio and I'm going to um [noise] vote\nFor a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do respect for that one I don't know if we're going to vote for the guardian endorsed Minnesota\nThis provided an opening for Gonzales who has been trying to link the popular governor with deal and by extension to Donald Trump Gonzales press the governor sang a vote for deal is a vote against women's rights abortion and L G Beatty writes all of which the governor supports\nLet's be clear Jeff deal as the share of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts seem to be a rubber stamp for Donald Trump select agenda and he would do everything in his power to under cut these very rights that you say you support and you say you're clear on your position\nIt sounds like you're clear in asking the people that states that sent Jeff deal to the United States Senate\nI'm very clear in my position on these issues and I've worked very hard on them here in Massachusetts and I'm going to continue to work hard on him here in Massachusetts\nIt was an awkward moment for bankers and it became even more so right after the debate when he amended his statement suggesting to reporters that he would vote for deal\nBy simply misspoke phenomena vote for the ticket then I think it's interesting that um my opponent spent so much time talking about the U.S Senate races so little time talking about the race for governor\nWhen Gonzalez spoke to reporters he said the governor is trying to have it both ways he can't say he is for a a woman's right to choose for algae B. T. Q. rights and then asked the people in Massachusetts to support Jeff deal and then\nWaffle on whether or not he's going to support Jeff deal where does he stand this was the sharpest disagreement last night but not the only one as they did in our last debate the two sparred about how to improve public transportation education and healthcare\nThey offer contrasting visions of state government perhaps the best illustrated by their views on health care Gonzales favors moving to a single payer system which he says would cost less and do more if we do it ... we will get\nThat they need we will save money and we will radically simplify the system and the system we have today is not working for people and it is not financially sustainable\nBut Baker says there's no evidence that a single payer system would work here and he points to Vermont which tried and failed to set one up he calls Gonzales his plan a hugely expensive case of trust me\nAnd most people in Massachusetts while they all of issues and concerns about the health care system they think the health care that they get is appropriately among the very best you're going to fight I mean what our way of turn the whole system upside down for that I just don't understand\nBaker favors are cautious approach that could include a new effort to bring down the price of prescription drugs but he keep the current system intact Gonzales advocate something much bigger and perhaps riskier I'm Anthony Brooks you're listening to the\nPublic radio eighty nine point three ...

their second debate last night to Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and his Democratic challenger Jay Gonzales disagreed about transportation education health care and how to pay for it all but their biggest disagreement was over the governor's support for fellow Republican Jeff deal\nThe challenger to Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren political reporter Anthony Brooks has that story\nIt was the most contentious moment in last night's debate sponsored by W GBH the moderators asked Baker about a pledge he made a while ago to support the entire Republican ticket which would include Jeff deal\nDeal co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts so this has prompted a bit of a balancing act for bake a moderate Republican with a number of liberal positions who did not vote for Trump Gonzales had a question for the governor\nIs going to vote for Jeff deal [noise]\nGovernor I'm going to vote for me I'm going to vote for Karen polio and I'm going to\nUm [noise]\nVote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do you expect that when you don't know if you're gonna vote for the guardian endorsed decision\nThis provided an opening for Gonzales who has been trying to link the popular governor with deal and by extension to Donald Trump Gonzales press the governor sang a vote for deal is a vote against women's rights abortion an algae Beatty writes all of which the governor supports\nLet's be clear Jeff deal as the share of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts seem to be a rubber stamp for Donald Trump select agenda and he would do everything in his power to under cut these very rights that you say you support and you say you're clear on your position\nIt sounds like you're clear and asking the people that states that sun Jeff deal to the United States Senate\nI'm very clear in my position on these issues and I've worked very hard on them here in Massachusetts and I'm going to continue to work hard on him here in Massachusetts\nIt was an awkward moment for Baker and it became even more so right after the debate when he amended his statements suggesting to reporters that he would vote for deal\nThey simply misspoke but I'm going to vote for the second thing I think it's interesting that um my opponents both so much time talking about the U.S Senate race and so little time talking about the race for governor\nWhen Gonzalez spoke to reporters you said the governor is trying to have it both ways\nHe can't say he is for a a woman's right to choose for algae tiki rights and then ask the people in Massachusetts to support Jeff deal and then waffle on whether or not he's going to support Jeff deal where does he stand\nThis was the sharpest disagreement last night but not the only one as they did in her last debate the two sparred about how to improve public transportation education and healthcare\nThey offer contrasting visions of state government perhaps the best illustrated by their views on health care Gonzales favors moving to a single payer system which he says would cost less and do more\nIf we do it's thoughtfully we will get make sure everybody has access to the health care services they need we will save money and we will radically simplify the system and the system we have today is not working for people and it is not financially sustainable\nBut Baker says there's no evidence that a single payer system would work here and he points to Vermont which tried and failed to set one up he calls Gonzales his plan a hugely expensive case of trust me\nMost people in Massachusetts while they all have issues and concerns about the health care systems they think\nVery best you're going to find anywhere and way of turn the whole system upside down for that I just don't understand\nBaker favors are cautious approach that could include a new effort to bring down the price of prescription drugs but he keep the current system intact Gonzales advocate something

firmly on the mic Sally [noise]\nAnd she thinks the Ford Kavanaugh hearings have amped up enthusiasm in her party I think it\nI'm not saying once I'm more than the other because I'm hearing from our side [noise] how does the Republican protests and we go to the vote we put money down and all of that\nIs one reason why Jim vote was phone banking for Democrats here since sin among one night last week to stave off any Republican surge\nWell a lot of my friends are more progressive you guys are going to do everything they can just like drier\nAnd while he hasn't seen evidence of the cabinet controversy boosting turnout he has seen it inching Democrats into becoming even more engaged\nThat just made it even more [noise]\nI'm not sure if it said okay we're going to open our eyes but it was about what else can Republicans may be getting more fired\nUp now but there was already plenty of democratic fury almost two years worth of it and democratic strategist Andy Barr things his party's anger has much more staying power\nPeople tend to do stuff out of anger and with the are sort of more than enough for them to pay ...\nFor whatever anger the Democrats in Arizona might be feeling over the cabinet controversy cinema the Democratic candidate doesn't sound outraged cinema has focused a lot of her rhetoric around process like the FBI investigation affords claims\nWhen I learned that we were not going to get access to the report I was very disappointed as I think many Americans were so I was forced to make a decision without being able to see that report\nForced to make a decision that's a far cry from other Democrats who have emphasized that they believe Kavanaugh had assaulted forward right now the races in a dead heat polling shows that send them a slight lead on mic Sally has narrowed in the last couple of weeks Republican strategist John Seton things cabin all played a part in that trend really what\nI think it did do is somewhat anyway galvanize coast center right and Republican voters to come all the fuel and make sure that they mail in their ballots both Republican ticket\nBut especially with the candidates and their allies sticking to other areas like immigration and health care as well as personal attacks democratic strategist bars says it's hard to say that the confirmation hearings are what narrows that gap\nThe undecided group typically more and they always start to come home right around you know we are to hell\nIn a debate this week both candidates chose not to weaponize the Kavanaugh fight too much while the president has gone so far as to call for Jackie's Asians a hoax mix Sally focused her criticism on Democrats an activist not forward herself\nWe're seeing the mob rule in Washington DC and in the end Arizona's wanted a yes vote on justice Cavanaugh I can be for survivors is one of myself and for justice Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile moderators had to ask cinema multiple times before she'd say how she'd have voted\nWe still haven't got enough where she no answer from you all the way I Would have voted no I Would have and I and I did put out a statement saying such\nWhether the cabin all confirmation gave either campaign a lasting boost the candidates are much happier talking about health care immigration and the economy Danielle Kurtzleben NPR News\n[noise] a federal regulator has publicly criticized large cell phone

mean he isn't on voters' minds Alan Abramowitz is a professor of political science at Emory University he studied mid term elections and says there is a very strong correlation between presidential approval and the results for his party\nAnd not only is it always about the president to some degree but there's a lot a lot of reasons to believe that now this year it'll be even more about the president\nAnd why is that well first of all because Trump has has tried to make it about him\nA vote for Marcia is really a vote for me and everything we stand for\nTo vote for me to vote for a vote for me I don't perceive as they voted for me remember\nThis\nVote hurt me and our agenda to make America great again\nIn the a P interview Trump explained that he was making this explicit appeal because the people at his rallies are there for him and some have even told him they don't plan to vote in the midterms in twenty fourteen President Obama made a similar appeal\nI'm not on the ballot this fall\nShort pretty happy about that [noise]\nBut make no mistake these policies are on the ballot every single one\nAt the time it was seen as a gaffe many Democrats were trying to distance themselves from Obama whose approval rating at the time within the low forties Trump's approval is in a similar spot now again Abramowitz\nYou're both public and incumbents who are at risk of losing their seats would probably rather localized election try and make it more about local issues about things they've done for their state or district and not about the president\nBut regardless of what candidates want this is a nationalized election sixty percent of voters according to a recent Pew Research center poll say Trump will be a factor in their congressional vote with a greater share
