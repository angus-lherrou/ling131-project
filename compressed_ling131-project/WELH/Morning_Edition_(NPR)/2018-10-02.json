witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nOf his number one in the class I thought oh no no no no no going after some of our online I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my ... year mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those

that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her\nPlace or has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the intra ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not\nJust running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's hangar well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry\nAnd protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment\nCodified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's\nAlmost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who has been the leaders and the leading fingers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about meat you one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a race\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise] that's\nTrue but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although\nWe have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women thing are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all that is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around calving off is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future [noise]\nRituals are with Rebecca Traister author of people go to map the revolutionary

that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer which passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system\nMarshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from\nYou exactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWell and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million ...\nPrices is there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get to leverage to hold down what is paid for a hospital and other medical costs\nMaryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers is you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high and get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to the smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage\nBut they can bring down the prices Marshall Allen at ProPublica thanks very much thanks so much Steve\nThis is Rhode Island public radio and you're listening on Tuesday October second to just about ten

[noise]\nOver the summer is where they come through in clean things\nIn the lab he uses a set of special chambers to mimic the vast spaces and tennis typically\nCover this is a larger ... chamber you can see it's covered at the same phone this was that big dome as a lens in China\nAnd they're each other back them or if you can see there are a couple of different squares\nSo he's one of those is an antenna\nMerle is designed as an example of massive my mode technology short for multiple input multiple out but traditional cell towers spread data outward in a single three hundred and sixty degree blob the watermelon size prototype splits the data and to several narrow beams that broadcast independently\nMulti beam antennas have been used in the past for defense applications that are just

more data through it everyone can stream their videos or do whatever we will be doing in ten or Twenty years with our phones are devices in our immersive virtual reality is\nBut the damage themselves could also be the answer modern cell phones typically operate at a frequency between point to an eight gig or hurts but if you move up the electromagnetic spectrum to anywhere between thirty and three hundred bigger hurts\nHe'll find what many consider the golden ticket a five gee technology millimeter waves these tight wavelengths can carry massive amounts of data fast\nAnd they've actually been used for a long time know attacking north Hampton company that specializes in millimeter wave technology has been working on military an aerospace projects for nearly forty years but like multi being antennas it's new territory for the telecom industry\n... millimeter waves are challenges with millimeter wave technology is the fact that it's such a high frequency it can be blocked by just about anything\nThat Jim McGregor principal analyst of serious research technology advisory firm based in Arizona\nIt can be blocked by your hand it can be blocked by blowing in the wind that can be bought by just about anything the higher you go in frequency the easier it is to block\nThe carriers could leverage the same being farming technology used in Murray role as antennas to overcome the interference problem\nIn some cases they can actually balance beam off other objects so bouncing off a building bouncing off a window off a wall [noise] um so that you can still use the millimeter wave even if it's partially blocked\nInforming solutions could mean big things for the millimeter wave market by twenty twenty three it's expected to grow anywhere from four hundred to eight hundred percent\nDepending on the forecaster Merlin agreed that marriage between the telecom and millimeter wave industries is inevitable but the timeline for that\nAnd its relationship to five gee is far from certain\nPeople have been drawing ... millimeter wave like hockey stick\nYear over year growth rates for\nAt least a decade haven't materialized yet\nAnd Merle is mind the road to five gee begins with those multi beam antennas he's testing and the UMass lab\nBy developing smaller versions of the Silicon Valley prototype think a slice of watermelon instead of the whole fruit role is as we can achieve five gee standards with normal frequencies first\nEventually the millimeter wave start to fill in in my opinion I think it's\nThe the exponential growth is more than five years\nThis is the

covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Marilyn Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money and so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid each hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see\nThat her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge list to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world is she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money so she said look you hospitals that are at five times and Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals she called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for a hospital and other medical costs\nMaryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers as you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high and get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to smaller employers may need to join together with\nThey can bring down the prices Marshall Allen at
