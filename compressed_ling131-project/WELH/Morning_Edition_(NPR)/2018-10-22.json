point three FM good morning it's six forty five Monday October twenty second\nThe top issue for many voters in Rhode Island governor's race is the economy and jobs and the Public Radio's political analyst Scott and Kate wonders how much influence the small states governor has yeah and the global economy\n... of the states in this country succeed or fail on what's happening in our inner connected globe\nSo long is money freely crosses borders and corporations are free to travel the world seeking lower wages in taxes politicians in American states only have so much economic clout\nOr islands in New England states was slow to make the switch from an economy yoke to manufacturing to one based on services the workforce is not so well educated as neighboring states\nThat meant that it was slower to exit the recession while the unemployment rate is near historic lows University of Rhode Island economists Leonard large Darrow points to a sobering statistic\nThe number of employed Rhode Island residents is about seven thousand fewer than two thousand seven just before the recession began taking it's grim toll\n... says Rhode Island's recent progress in reducing unemployment is largely due to a rebounding national economy and the grand accident of geography living next door to booming Massachusetts a national leader in innovation if you listen to a democratic governor\nTo to her policies she tells her job training and wrote in Britain repair programs as full crumbs of more jobs she deserves credit for the road repairs the governor pushed her truck totally measure through a somewhat reluctant general assembly and has been aggressive and fixing longer collected bridges and roads\nAnother among do initiative free tuition at the community college of Rhode Island is the type of investment designed to build a better workforce\nAnd job training Raimondo may have less influence\nFor example some of the best blue collar manufacturing jobs are at the submarine builder electric boat those jobs are in Rhode Island because they are financed by the federal government and depend more on Senator Jack Reed the ranking member of the armed Services Committee than on any state government policy\nThere is a serious question as to how much state taxpayers ought to shell out to train workers for huge defense contractors such as electric boat the beneficiary of billions of federal tax dollars\nAs Richard mcentire chairman of the University of Rhode Island economics departments says quote we're giving away government money to people who already have too much\nAnother dent in the window administrators policies is the lack of smart data about state medical benefits used by employees of large companies state law requires the department of Human Services to report every year on which firms employees are getting their health care from taxpayers through Medicaid\nBut state government doesn't know who they are because the state hasn't been collecting this information\nThe last time such data was distributed was in two thousand and nine there were ... administration has been ignoring its own law\nThis means the governor and lawmakers are making decisions based on anecdotes and what they hear from lobbyists and perhaps political donors state centered allude to Palmer a Middletown Democrat says it's embarrassing that the studies required by law hadn't been completed\nThe status hands on more than three hundred and fifty million dollars in tax breaks to companies since two thousand eight\nHow much of this has corporate welfare to businesses that slough off their workers medical care to taxpayers\nWe just don't know\nAnother criticism levy by with our all the you are I economists who study the state's economy for years is how short term policies that puts small amounts of money in people's wallets from long term investments\nThe car tax phase out as an example but are all questions whether it's spending two hundred twenty million dollars on getting rid of the car tax is the best way to spend that money compared to education and infrastructure investments in the states future\nEconomic questions are complex former U.S house speaker Tip O'Neill said often that statistics don't informed votes on the economy rather these are kitchen table issues that voters decide depending on how their lives are going and whether
