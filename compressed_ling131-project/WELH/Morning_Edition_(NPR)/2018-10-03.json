China considered the Americans a threat and a huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he swept this information under the\nRug what was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealize that this was a

News I'm Rachel\nMartin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall the Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through now judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy led the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics of the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does it affect their legacy or not ... well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have any means that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they'd been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge [laughter] but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been so you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status if you use Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Rand off in the house of representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\n'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth still Connecticut\nHave a lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIt's so what was the result is that what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots\nOf judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age them both and they have been talk of Eighteen year term limits Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat

Can't say they're so President Trump clearly believes that politicizing the Kavanaugh hearing is a good idea based on his comments last night do Republican leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats\nTo vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they're trying to do and I think we should probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of this and Republicans it took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so far as to say

bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the winters in stock\nCar or whatever you got to be in order to do just dumped up to ... to let you go and vote on that we shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to ask you to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized that thing to do was to use a random\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses the virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and\nIncluding antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically\nChange our world well you know\nBy using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know developed enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease so you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z or ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price sale\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know ... it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up NPR's Nell

into the fight over his Supreme\nBe he outright mocked the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford who's accused nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault\nI Want I Want\nYou know I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there don't remember where I don't remember how many\nEarlier in the day in front of reporters the president worried aloud about the upshot of the Kavanaugh hearings\nVery scary guy for young men and America what you're going to be a seal you receive it you may not be guilty of\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell says he plans a vote of the full Senate this week on the Kavanaugh's nomination NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell is in the studio with us this morning I Can't pay their\nSo President Trump clearly believes that politicizing the Kavanaugh hearing is a good idea based on his comments last night do Republican leaders agree Republican leaders are still trying to convince undecided Republicans and even some Democrats\nTo vote for Kavanaugh and this kind of conversation is kind of the exact opposite of what they're trying to do and I think she probably also point out that the president has made clear that he takes this personally that he and he has a personal connection with allegations and he says what he believes to be false allegations of sexual misconduct\nAnd that is playing a role in the way that he's responding to all of this and Republicans took great pains to not criticized Christine Blasey Ford even going so far as to say she's credible right they're gone they're gone out of their way to create a paper trail and to kind of make\nThe case that they are listening to forward and they're going through all of the appropriate steps of having the FBI investigation the supplemental investigation into these accusations so that they can say that this isn't political but I talked to a lot of senators who worried that the concept and the conversation about sexual assault is becoming political as a result of this hearing\nOne of those people was Bob Corker who's retiring bombs from Tennessee Republican he's clashed with the president in the past but he seems pretty uncomfortable and this is what he said\nI Know a lot about sexual assault that we don't care about that is ridiculous lot that's way it's been portrayed and and uh you know it's a shame\nNow that was part of a longer more extended conversation with Corker about his real fears that this is a moment that will be hard to come back from both politically and ... with the way the country interacts on major issues

says was self defense\nStringent parcels towards me be with a knife from is lower right side of words cross society first my left shoulder and when he did what did you get a shot [noise]\nSome of the testimony yesterday from Jason Van Dyke Patrick Smith of member station WBEZ in Chicago has been following the story Patrick mourning\nMourning okay so I I just now I went back and watched this dash cam video again and again like wind McDonald is not doing what the police said but\nHe's walking along the street has gotten out of his vehicle he's walking past the officers he's a distance of about a traffic lane away from the nearest one and then suddenly spins and goes down as he's shot that's what a shock to people but it sounds like this officer describes goes very events are very differently\nYes he does and and honest and insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um\nYou know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective um that was ...\nThe dash cam video can't see like McDonald's face and his and he describes his huge eyes and and his and you know no expression on his face he was looking through Van Dyke\nAnd then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonalds turning toward him with and waving and nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAs a police officer the bar or for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a reasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to\nShow why he would reasonably be in fear for his life like that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nI guess that [noise] excuse me I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court Russia watchers through the first two weeks of trial or do you think they can take the stand or what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um where you really have to testify cop or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to\nBring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go\nWell um when lobster Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he's very emotional he cried when he describes the shooting\nWhen he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nAnd I did not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting because he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors he seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nDid his initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the look but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements five require McDonald the wave of the knife raising the nice and and it described officer Van Dyke backpedaling from McDonald none of those things are on the dash cam video\nPatrick Smith of

week so far no bells have been handed out for physics and medicine and today's chemistry the royal Swedish Academy of scientists announced the winters in Stockholm\nComing obvious it's going to talk of the main goal just dumped up to to let you go and do all these shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winters presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate oh no I don't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award a shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them this on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry\nIdeas they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right the enzymes to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quote somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and\nIncluding antibiotics that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z or ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price sale\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years um the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know ... it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up\nNPR's Nell
