{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "The financial crisis highlighted the extent to which what who's being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen did you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning in class what we're seeing on the news I suppose banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning to enact classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics classes a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimension to the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives\nAnd one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which seemed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession had become windy colon is the most widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books\nIn terms of understanding the crash things as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had spent a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting\nAnd there was no section on banks all the financial system and this was very typical of the way that correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true and not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics close rooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they give bad advice you can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration felt my students and the teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses\nIn one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the core charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cool to to bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nHad massive monitor using economics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to bind even criminal behavior by buying cars that can freshman financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking\nThey remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end\nIgnoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flood incentives and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment sets and tire early unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more about you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before\nLet's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best I can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think that the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joe Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance recalling him was on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nWere blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of Mike say conservative economics seems Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true I think it would be horrified at the abuse\nIs that uh whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but ... and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will have often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of invisible hand than supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things in their self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some other ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the house of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were a science\nOnly works if you mentioned all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted journalist Katrin muscles book who cooked Smith spinner argues the traditional economic\nTheories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity to be self centered so unlike humans is almost a different species in fact some economists have given the species a name Homer economic ...\nHome economic ... doesn't have any feelings at least they failings and not relevant to his economic decision making he's they're sort of rational fake calculating brain that is always acting additive south and chest and all of the set of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more er visits sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to excluded from these models like\nEmotions family the faulty failings compassion and altruism\nAnd all of these things that we have been told that these are not economically relevant they are not anything that we need to studying economics days like ... the same things that we have been torched it view as female I notice the off to the Chrysler people are saying\nThis great is a good philosophy and is very\nNarrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back and we can't solve our economic problems without the courage to\nSee us health with all that makes us human and failed economic models and economic theory that is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin Schumann that people are simply irrational like next cube mentions of what makes us human that this was an important reason why ... to see the crisis coming they do not understand the Bruce collusion and trading testosterone that makes bankers\nMark a dream as rights to highlight the rest of the factors that influence decisions she's expecting too much of economics we need any discipline to incorporate all aspects of human behavior the growing depth and breadth of knowledge requires most specialization but to understand how to tackle road we'll problems more into this marriage is required\nThe financial crisis happened in my view must because the tools didn't exist in economics to understand what was happening but because the wrong tools we used and challenging questions were not being asked to individuals in institutions inside and outside the economics discipline", "year":
