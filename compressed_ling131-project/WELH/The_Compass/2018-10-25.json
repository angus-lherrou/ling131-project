actually seen so far is small very small relative to what we risk\nFor example a bigger hurricanes on Sunday that almost wrecked New York in two thousand twelve kind of be ruled out with most financial centers near coasts expected ocean rising rates of storms will be severely destabilizing\nClimate change should be a global priority for many reasons box in the short term in my view a pandemic is the most likely cause of the next financial crisis and one that will work for the ill prepared for\nPeter ... the director the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics I asked him about the risks they pose\nTo condemn it could trigger a global recession it all depends how big it is of course and where it's real hits\nAnd we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago I'm reduced global GDP by about five percent speed trillion in these days we know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of size really hit the GDP by about closest three percent\nBut it was also an increase by two hundred base point in the country risks premium so that's another problem so according to the the size of the epidemic we're talking\nAbout the damage in terms of trillions nothing billions\n\nThe lesson that has yet to be loans the second is that management and regulations focused on what was happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which transcended national borders\n\nIn the u._k. the separation of investments in retail banks has addressed the number but not all the sources of risk so John Vickers of colleagues Oxford University shed independent commission on banking sets up by the u._k. government following the crisis I asked him whether this has made banking safer\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions\nDoing ordinary high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends then the second heading was how to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses\nIf you're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended\nA kind of separation cooled ring fencing so this is the idea that the only high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped as cool things which we all this individuals and small businesses depend on which a government can't let for life without titled calamity\nThat those activities in major banks\nShould be in a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposures to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperil domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some jeopardy so that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the abduction of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentrated in fewer hands in the u._k. is in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bail out the ailing banks and to sweets in terms of the merger with bigger banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks could even bigger and competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail\nIf they collapsed they would bring down the whole system this implies that governments which means the taxpayers have given them an implicit guarantee of survival here's enough to have moxie ... of the bankers' new clothes\nThe size of the largest banks certainly grow\nThat will tell you that they did the favor swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural and nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in lock it they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they had the privileged existence why they keep getting\nFunding despite being sold risky insult pay\nTheir too many privileges of too many subsidies that's coming down with the status of being sort of that big and dominant and so all the counter parties want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your loan\nI asked her whether measures to prevent the next financial crisis and improve matches well made them was\nI think that he has made things worse and even though it may have been their first response you know quick solution it really ended up with a system ten years later that's pretty scary and distorts the economy about competition and about and just about anything\nFor growing complexity and into dependency of the banking system was facilitated by revolution reached technological changes such as growing computer power\nWhich allowed physics and math graduates to build financial products which they taught buses let alone the regulators politicians and customers do not understand far from reducing\nAnd spreading is\nI think we were told it all these innovations and that word you know used around Silicon Valley where I Am a lot innovation was kind of a great thing that it would allow you know more efficient funding it would spread the risk ever more efficiently around the world\nAnd instead it was really a lot of financial innovation is really about\nClever ways to hide or asks and clever ways to avoid taxes and clever ways to do things that are not necessarily as for for society so yeah at some level you want it functioning financial system and the fastest in can do wonderful things\nBut out of control it it's really dangerous and I think that a lot of energy it was spent in justifying things that are not that great and in a void eating discussion of all day\nSaturday way sometimes in which the public was deceived do miss sold and older misconduct that goes on in this industry\n[noise]\nAs the pace of technological change has accelerated this concern has become more acute and increasingly\nKnown financial institutions such as ... companies mobile\nPhone operates and others issue in credit with very little regulation oversight [noise] new cyber currencies such as bitcoin also typically avoid the regulate ... [noise] I said meeting of new technology innovators\nI miss it so God of electric capital which trades digital currencies he told me that it's no accident that corner rose immediately after the\nFinancial crisis as it's aimed\nTo build a financial system without relying on will being supervised by\nThe discredited government authorities\nBecause it was launched into a NATO and it was very much catalyzed by the failure of the financial system fundamentally the words intermediary trust\nTrust lesson is these are the terms that you see recovering and and the original decline my paper and it's because fundamentally what happened in two thousand eight is we realized that the system was predicated on trusting these very large and powerful intermediaries\nAnd one of the intermediaries fail the entire system fails with it that collapse indicated not only that the system itself has\nSome critical design flaws that got I think of all going in terms of thinking about what a system might look like they did not have those fairly\nRecent years have shown that bitcoin and other digital currencies veteran not issued by central banks suffer from many of the same failings as other currencies in fact they've been subject to even more volatility and fraud\nBitcoin advocates and other new technology firms typically like to convince us that the new technologies or force for good\nBut the financial crisis highlight to the extent to which technology can be both a friend on the phone\nTechnological change can bring great benefits but it also can be a source of mayhem which amplifies risk\nThe same technologies which allow me to communicate this program with listeners around the world and for you to disseminate through social media could be used for example by people on Facebook to spread fake news\n[noise]\nThe crisis arose because decision makers were blinded by blizzard of information finance is highly dates are intensive industries order to his credit rating agencies banks and regulators reduced everything\nTo numbers [noise] as the volume of Trump's actions group and computing power increased more and more data was being crunched\nAnd economists were able to build and models using ever bigger data sets and yet relying on the states it proved to be increasing the inadequate as decision makers\n... what matches from the fire hose of data directed at them [noise]\nBusiness and political leaders are meant to be paid for their judgment thinking and intuition the evidence shows they relied on badly interpreted big dates and groupthink and when the system collapsed they took refuge and blaming others", "show_name": "The Compass", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "25"}
