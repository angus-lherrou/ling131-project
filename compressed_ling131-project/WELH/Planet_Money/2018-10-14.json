consistent basis but not all was comfortable to really began to develop a deeper understanding of things that divide us\nConversations or the connective tissue for the community because we aren't just public radio we are the public's review\nYou're listening to Planet Money the other day I had an early morning interview and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of invited her with my my maybe we should say uh where are you\nThis is Cathy I'm Sorry I don't know it might you might need to get my name's yeah that's probably the easy question I'm Catherine Rampell in town and sit and watch\nThe civically Catherine writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect

half an hour from a game on our biggest the\nGame yes and not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's pastime well critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there has been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest\nIn fact he tells us he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty

of all the stories that we've told on this show so far I think it's a fairly safe to say that stony field yogurt has had more ups and downs and\nReally more down then just about any other ... and it's pretty unlikely tail to begin\nTo ego hippie farmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company they start small milking their own cows\nMaking their own yogurt shelling locally to nuns and then eventually spreading themselves way too thin and sliding into deep debt you know over the years don't heal this headache loses lieu of near death experiences\nBut it never white guy did in fact it grew and grew into one of the most popular yogurt brands in the United states\nAnd one thing about starting fields cofounder of Gary ... is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company he knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire is dad owned and ran a pretty big shift\nThey were probably fifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so so how many people did your dad's company employ several thousand I think at their peak they were at twenty eight hundred wow he's were true\nCompany chance of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nThe dark side of that is that when they simply because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed you know all these communities did as well and what happened to your family

businessman that early I mean do you say your parents are both entrepreneurial\nNo I I started thinking about running as far as I possibly could away from it [noise]\nYou know I obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was the result of a steady decline and my my grandfather my father and my uncle we're all in the business and I used to sit or work there and I would listen to them screaming at each other you know they were arguing you know a a passionately\nOr about what to do about this downturn and so to me business was this thing\nWhere people got people yelled at each other people hung up funds on each other people were stressed a employees lost\nTheir jobs and it and on top of that serious of pollution so it led to my deciding that business was the worst thing on
