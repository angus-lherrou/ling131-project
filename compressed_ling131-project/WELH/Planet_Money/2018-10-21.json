today because I feel like it's fair to say become mildly obsessed with the topic of today's show\nThat might be some truth to that um look I'm a journalism professor I think a lot about at worry a lot about fake news and much generally I'm really concerned about trust on the Internet\nAnd it came to us and said uh before there was fake news before there was the possibility of like fake video and fake audio the world was dealing with a different fake problem\nYes fake online reviews people have been posting this on as an online fake reviews for years yeah and\nAnd this is becoming such a huge problem because like you know I go on line to buy a hover board and I don't know if this had record has five stars because it is awesome and I'm On a cruise around town looking cool or if it has five stars because someone is making up those reviews and in fact when I take it home it's going to set my house on fire\n... is here with a glimmer of hope for us\nYeah and the dilemma of it's coming from

store and I'll have like an avocado and the onion and a bottle of water\nOh that's high stakes dropping off Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around two thousand six\nTommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen and it was a bit of a gym rat at his peak he could bench press around two hundred and forty pounds\nOne day Tommy was hanging out with a friend\nWhen he says hey you want the rest of this pre workout pre workout that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid and case that's what you're thinking Tommy is very against using those anyways\n... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he says the Tommy\nPaid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counterproductive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things online like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer they could just\nTell me sign a paternity he could built an online review side what bodybuilder skipped honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into that bodies\nAnd so time he got to work he taught himself some computer coding and he created what he would eventually call supplement reviews dot com before long super chiseled dudes were logging on to leave their super honest reviews and look I Know not all bodybuilder sound this way but\nThe reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average\nThese reviews of those five days pretty suspicious especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average views they weigh more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with\nWords that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo after them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the courts do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in three reviews [noise]\nUh yeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the court and to use again ah I don't know what it means for seven people feel that way [laughter] well\nSeven people also say they performed at their duty with honor and respect and there is the correct ... [laughter]\nYeah so\nTommy software random about a dozen different tests on iPhone cable reviews and his reports it out and it just aggravating\nUh so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after ten reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy site only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust way they leave you say actually these cables that crap\nTommy says generally speaking cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm like what yeah yeah I found cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills to stop\nWe of course reached out to Amazon about this\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy's website they sent us an extensive statement about it\nReview met itself admits that they do not have the\nSafety if you could do this one is like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even said with high confidence whether a review was fake according\nTo what Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural fire Amazon that as a\nProblem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon and of that total less than one percent or an authentic\nAmazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers\nIn other words Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like wonder a little bit how much should I trust\nThat big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSuch complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they sound more products\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review it someone buys a product that's good for the site\nThat that that might come a time where there was just too many fake Vivian sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nTrust is lost that we all just give up yeah fun Internet shopping\n[noise] [laughter] we won't go back to a fan of his way to go to Brandon [laughter] well\nThere is a point where it's just that all of them and we have to go back to talking to our friends again or you have to call your mom for shopping advice that yes what you pay
