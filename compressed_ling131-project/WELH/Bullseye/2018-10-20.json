[noise]\n\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse foreign I'm so excited to welcome Susan Orlean back to our show Susan is a staff writer at the New Yorker she's also appeared in vogue and Esquire on this American Life she's the author eight books covering topics like New England\nSaturday Night in America an orchid fanatics last one the or could be ended up being the basis of the Academy Award nominated film adaptation Susan is uh disarming interviewer meticulous researcher at a beautiful writer\nNewsday she lives here in Los Angeles where we make our show\nAnd being an author and to read or she has visited the beautiful historic central libraries year dozens and dozens of times her latest book is about that library and its history and particularly about the devastating fire that almost demolish the librarian Nineteen eighty six\nThe book is also kind of a pay on to libraries everywhere will demean her with us why every library is a vital institution\nThe book is called the library book it's one of my favorites I've read this year\nSusan Orlean a welcome back troubles I always happens you\nIt's great to be with you Susan what is your relationship with libraries personally other than your obvious financial relationship [laughter]\nOne would hope um well I grew up going to the library that was very much a part of my childhood and my parents were great\nLibrary goers they didn't really believe in buying books they I think they felt like why would you buy a book you go to the library and borrow the book and if that's not end you put your name on a whole list and you get it when it's available\nAnd they were born in the depression and I'm sure that's a lot of it which is that buying books seemed like a bit of an indulgence that wasn't necessary\nI grew up going to the library a couple of times a week with my mom and I found it\nAbsolutely magical it was not like going to a bookstore or a toy store it was partly because there was no money there was no financial relationship and when your kid the idea that you can have anything you want is really intoxicating\nAt a library is one on on a real short list of places that welcome everyone including kids were a hassle right well and I do think\nThat in the last Twenty years we've as a society become more and more conscious a kind of call it the Starbucks effect we've become conscious of\nHow\nHome and there's your workplace and there's kind of a desire for another place somewhere to go somewhere to see other humans and just sort of share the space with them\nIt I think it's why people go to co working space is I think it's why people go to public parks even if they've got a backyard there's something\nVery special about being somewhere around other people and you're not there to interact with them you're just sharing space with them\nAnd that's definitely some quality of life\nAnalog is probably a public park\nYou have written for the New Yorker for thirty some years and ah and you're a New Yorker for a long time how did your experience of living in Los Angeles\nCompared to your expectations about Los Angeles [noise] I had\nTravelled here a lot over the years before I moved here and ... had been downtown once as far as I knew [noise]\nUm my expectation of Los Angeles was that I Would never spend time downtown and at the time I moved here which is now seven years ago [noise]\nDowntown was just on the brink of really changing and revitalizing and re populating\nI never imagined that I Would be doing a book about the library I moved to Los Angeles because my husband was asked to help with the company and that was starting up and we thought oh that'd be fun and we'll go for a year or get some nice weather and go back to New York at the end of the year\nIn the course of being here I was given a tour of the downtown library and first of all I thought oh my God this building is amazing it's a beautiful building and a very eccentric interesting piece of architecture Nineteen twenties era but\nInflicted with all of this sort of addiction and Moroccan kind of a aesthetic and it's a really interesting building so I was kind of struck immediately just about what it called building it was and how I had never been downtown to see it [noise]\nBut walking through the library and thinking boy this is just an incredible repository of amazing stories I was being told some of the stories of of various city librarians who had run library over the years many of whom were incredibly eccentric\nFascinating figures and\nI found myself just being drawn and more and more thinking oh my God this is an amazing place somebody should write about this not thinking that somebody was me [noise] um\nAnd right at a moment the person giving me the tour had pulled one of the books off the shelf and took a deep whiff of the book\nI thought well I guess I'm In a new city where people do things like smells books and I I kind of dismissed it until he said well you can still smell the smoke in some of them\nAnd I thought how they used to let people smoke in the library that seem very bold and I said well you know was this back when they allowed smoking and he said\nNo no they didn't never allow smoking in the building\nIt was from the fire I said what fire and he said the big fire the big fire in Nineteen eighty six and I said I don't know what you're talking about he said well the big fire closed library down for seven years and you know he\nMoved on and I was going like one was still wouldn't no no no don't I don't want to see the next\nServing Rhode Island and southeastern

Saturday Night her newest tells the story of the Los Angeles public library so much more it's called the library book hits bookstores this week\nThe arson investigators ... eventually decided that are so\nWho was the person who was accused of average started at\nA young man in his twenties named Harry peak who was um\nI guess predictably a wannabe actor\nAaron boy I'm you know did odd jobs parked cars that kind of thing [noise]\nUm [noise] was well what what happened was he had told a number of friends that he had started the fire so very quickly ... ah [noise] once there was a reward\nAssociated with anyone having providing a tip for solving the fire or one of his friends good to have friends like that came forward and\nUm basically connected the fire department to him and they began following them around and ended up I'm interviewing him to figure out whether his boasts of having started the fire we're we're in fact true\nShe was a charming liar he\nWas from every description I had from anybody he was an immensely likeable guy charming and just a crazy favor own would just tip about stupid thing not\nJust sip he'd say where where have you been to I was having drinks with share you know he just couldn't tell a straight story and\nHis friends would it were exasperated by him and at the same time also said he was a really good guy would give you the shirt off his back and that was interesting to me they all use that exact expression he would give you the shirt off his back he was\nThe love and and also drove them crazy\nSo in a way this is what might be called a true\nCrime narrative I guess\nAnd I wonder if you felt pressured by the fact that you were telling a crime story to have a narrative that resolved comfortably to provide an answer to the question\nI I did I\nFirst of all I thought I'm going to solve this which is utterly veins [laughter] I mean that there's no way that as civilian with no access to\nThe evidence and no knowledge of how to investigate and arson would be able to crack the case but that was my first thought is I'm going to solve this [noise] um and\nMaybe if you had a ragtag band friends it right and like the actual van has\nCome on guys and a big dog right isn't that the visit to be do premise but I'm\nI'm fairly comfortable with the idea that\nI don't have to come to a final conclusion and it may be\nOut of the reality of so many of the things I write about don't have a tidy conclusion or don't resolve and the way that I might have expected them to resolve in this case I think following the different possible outcomes it's a bit of a choose your own adventure and\nAnd you come to your own conclusion essentially a because there's no way to reexamine the evidence\nAt this point\nAll of this different paths of thought that could lead you to a conclusion [noise]\nIt may be that when I wrote the orchid safe and I was determined to see it goes to work at it and as time has growing short and I thought oh my God the book is ruined I'm never going to see a ghost shortcut and I finally had a deadline that I had to make\nAnd I didn't see one\nSuddenly it seemed like well of course I'm not going to see one that's that's the point it\nIt doesn't matter that I'm not going to see it it it would never\nMatch the anticipation of seeing it so it was the first experience I had a ... conclusion conclusion and\nIn its own way it felt I mean it is the reality is it the fact is without giving anything away it's it's not possible to\nCome to a conclusion I mean my my notion that I Would solve it being something that very quickly I realize that's nuts but it isn't possible to\nUltimately now what happened and I was comfortable finally thinking that's OK I'm giving you the different paths of thought and and um maybe you see the one of them being the persuasive one\nWell Susan Arlene I really loved your book and I always love for having on the show thank you so much for coming over and
