I. production is that it's all a U.S so we can do whatever the hell we won't apparently\n... ... ... ... ...\nWas what you want it it is what we wanted because of what we wanted was a the idea that the nuclear explosion was so powerful and we were in a little refrigerator\nWe wanted to give the impression that we had to tumble a lot 'cause you know it centers flying so ... H E ... who represents another flip\nDid he do of the of the of the fridge that were originally we had a great sound Cuban I like and we went back and forth were jak did he might want to do it we're\nReally getting into the we will news right now yeah we're still nip it in talking to the lake and your calls that's\nAt this point in your lives gentleman ... as you let's say enter middle age like tell you a raise that sir why are you going on stage to Iraq what does it mean in your life relative to win\nOld car would have to be for him to be entering middle it that'd be so you'd be like a hundred and fourteen lives are getting longer [laughter] that's right yeah you can make it to a hundred and forty minutes away the middle that's always been the middle aged white middle aged forty five really are you really going and I\nI don't I mean fifty is the one you say fifty is then you're half way to a century mark if you're an optimist\nWell when you're on the backside of life I think you do learn to appreciate everything more him actually rocking on stage or one of the few transcendent kind of special experiences\nThat I enjoy so that's what I like\nWell I mean Twenty years ago every concert felt like a fiery hoop there's a lot more adrenaline involved in general\nAre but the creative process remains the same way it's always climbing that that mountain and pushing the stone up what is that ... ... or ... sure and um I still get the same charge out of the creative experience\nAnd um this this one here represents like our most personal work in that this is our baby a hundred percent\nThe stuff that we did before ... there was always more of a collaboration or feel to it this time it's like we don't have by boat and Kirk and David Cross of mister show there to hand hold us carry us across the finish line we wrote this and directed at ourselves and when's it\nFeels like was fate you know what it feels that hey finally grown up yeah gross do suddenly all closed up a ... it's late but here we are [laughter]\nI have to say that I ... the image that I have of you guys on stage is in some ways fixed by like the first times that I saw you on stage you know at\nWhatever the great American music call and go or whatever that wow and uh or on your you know your original TV show that way you know the premise of it was that your audience was pathetic we um [noise]\nYou bet you were pathetic plant performing for pathetically smaller you know but we never put nobody in the crowd you noticed there was there [laughter]\nAnd there was always a few people or a genuine smattering of apply yeah that's the only one I was reading about your career and realized that you have literally played shows four eighty five thousand people and\nAnd that was like almost alarming to ...\nYou know it's more alarming is that it's almost feels normal now to do that because we've done it so many times yeah but in fairness\nWe they didn't all they came to see Metallica that one was about when we were on right before Metallica I don't know that we're going to pull that crowd [laughter] ah I felt like we had a one over at least Seventy two percent of them by the end of that ... that was a good that was a good day\nI personally would be terrified to go on stage Metallica fifty something fun me oh we are\nI don't get around it was yeah it's always a a little bit\nThere's a fight or flight reflects that takes that takes over right before it's time to go on stage\nAnd me and kind of look to each other with terror in a row loophole we look for a loop hole is there some way that this could be cancels we would we would actually be relieved but then we get out there and experience to a powerful rush that's gonna similar to some kind of spiritual or or drug related experience\nI think there's something really embarrassing about saying about your actual feelings and that sort of singer songwriter that never seem to job [laughter] no that's not us we gotta we are being funny\nMore with Jack and Kyle from tenacious D. is coming up they'll go anywhere we haven't even gotten to talking about ... first ever acting gig a starring role in a commercial for the video game pitfall it's bull's eye for maximum fund dot org and NPR\nOh\nThis is Rhode Island public radio [noise] coming out that eight o'clock snap judgment to\nFunding provided by listeners like Lucas and Heather from Bristol and nail communication ... created agency with its worldwide headquarters in Providence Rhode Island\nOnline at nails dot C.

like early on and doing tenacious day\nI mean here's the thing ... aside from the friendship and the the the uh the mentors ship that was happening there there was also I felt early on that there was a chemistry there that just the idea in my mind ... going on stage\nBecause it was inevitable that we were going to go on stage at some point soon and perform our act whatever it was going to be and I had a feeling in my bones that the two of us together just the image of his face\nAnd my face up on stage together that there was something undeniably hilarious about it while I'm being funny and wrong and wonderful man I did not see that he didn't see that I felt it in my bone [laughter]\nWell we didn't even perform\nProper like in a club or like four years armed with the actors gang at a at a coffee house on high on no longer there highland ground ground so and we named our so on on our first concert there\nThere wasn't a concert it was like we were part of a variety show yeah and we got like five minutes slot in that show and we named ourselves and\nPart of our slot was naming the band and we gave the audience a multiple choice and a one of them was gorgeous sons mischief\nAnother one was pets are mean term and based on the amazing documentary by Michael Moore and a response of corresponds with corn for those and then a bubble was biblical tales about Bo was biblical theater and tenacious D. and in the audience who was in the audience that day prophetic\nIt was tell him cage Harry Shearer thank you Harry Shearer of spinal ... was in high end grown and he voted voted for pets or meat 'cause I I think he's just pals with Michael Moore [laughter] but the fact that he was there was a sign from the from the metal God's that we were on the right track\nAnd we were anointed I think even more\nYeah [noise]\nDo you use [noise]\nOh you do [noise]\nFor his latest album James is taking on one of the great bill with James new album lean on me features twelve rendition of his favorite bill withers tracks the one you're listening to right now is using it he recorded it right here in Los Angeles where we make this show in Capitol\nRecords famous studio bit but not before getting bill withers blessing of course you got that from a legend over dinner so when we asked him to talk about the song that changed his life you'd think he might go with a bellwether song right but instead he picked love unhappiness\nA classic from another all time great soul singer outbreak okay let's go to say my introduction to Al Green I'm anybody major probably laugh at this was actually watching pulp fiction\nEverybody knows who seems you know where\nYou know the gangster I saw this while this is being introduced and you know they're playing this this coup seventies soul music\nFingers but\nRight now you got ability [noise]\nPainful as it may be ability\nFact the lights but after the fact that lucky I asked is going to have to get realistic about\nAny acquaintance is such a genius for using music in these crazy ways you know ... ... me this whole tradition of how soul music is use or in these gangster movie and he's black gangster movies and it was so cool United immediately made me want to\nLearn who was that singer what was the sound of what was this behind the scenes\nIn the business was filled to the brim with an unrealistic [noise]\nWere caught they asked what age like one [noise]\nHave you made in terms of vinegar\nHave you made it gets better when they get dumped [noise]\nHad to go by the soundtrack to pulp fiction and I went to the electric fetus which was princes favorite record store in Minneapolis that's where I pretty much you know build my entire collection from jazz they have\nIt was and remains to this day it just been amazing records\nAnd the fact that the CD home\nOpen it up and that's how I was let stay together by Al Green said okay who's Al Green you know and then\nAnd then this one track eleven happiness just completely you know grab me and it took me on the other direction no\n[noise]\nNo we're coming from a jazz background I'm I'm always looking for something a little bit more sophisticated and loving happiness starts out of time you know robotic [noise] and it's just teaches singing loving housing\n\nAnd then that foot stop comes in you know on a box that that that\nHe didn't do it and it was like oh okay I was such a student of jazz\nStandard which are very clever and you know [noise] a verb both spend you know this was a quite different you know he's standing at the same loving happiness okay\nAnd it's like wait a minute something's going wrong oh pavement bump\nAnd go do some Muslims who wants to do\nWith the drama you know some was on the phone three o'clock in the morning and like that kind of rhyme come from hip hop I loved that immediately you know can you talk to the dollar loan free o'clock in the mom's from was on the phone\nTalking about she can make it like that such an intriguing line that I was already hooked because I'm a I'm a lyricist and where it's\nYou know being in love with my mom [noise] [noise] [noise] you know\nHave [noise] at that point I was really a jazz jazz or nearby but I didn't really know much about so and I didn't understand it\nOur brain actually started as a jazz singer and I found out you know beyond where Marvin Gaye winters we well all these guys started out as soon as they had a certain kind of jazz information and your hair out in the very beginning go up and hold that no no\nJust hold it forever that could be like Sarah Vaughan\nWas really cool to me it would be the key to walk away when\nHe cut his record for high record in Memphis and there were no for a very distinctive [noise]\nOne of the distinctive things about the sessions that Iraq has Hodges brothers teeny ideas on guitar Charles on Oregon's rewrite on base and then we had the legendary al Jackson on most of the ... and that\nWith a section was so legendary they were responsible for you know cranking out so many of that era what strikes me about how they recorded this track to our brains vocal and it's very raw may come home\nYou\nDo do do\nDo do do do do do that [noise] you\nKnow ... you know I was used to the Michael Jackson which is very hot you know there's like there's like three lead vocals and it's a very smooth and there's like a reverse and all these things this is just one might you can tell you know he's in a room with them you know what I mean\nI Love it because it really conveys all of the emotion in his delivery captures every nuance in this was almost like documentary recording like it's obviously was a huge hit but it's like this is a moment of him just jamming with these guys and performing you know he's really performing student could feel that energy\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThis track open my eyes to a third path and maybe if you know I knew about jazz which to me he was about learning the standards provide them off of the changes and I knew about\nKind of more powerful you are about ... I wasn't a rapper you know I didn't have the skills to be an issue\nAnd this is like a third pad it's like you could be a singer songwriter like our brains but it's still full of jazz information and still working\nAnd direct marriages and I don't know just a light bulb went off and it all made sent\nBack home alone [noise]\nSay Jay with the song that changed his life\nHis new album is lean on me it's a great collection of bill weather's coverage and it's out now I really think James is one of the great singers going right now let's take a listen to one more song off of his new record this one is lovely day\nSome men with long enough [noise] ... you might\nNot look at you [noise] and the world\nRight [noise] [noise] just one look at you\nAnd\nIts balls I I'm Jessica ... you know usually we\nDemanding something for popular culture that I write but I saw some great stand up comedy the other day and the comic Ted Alexandros ... that I could share it with you here so I'm I'm going to do that\nIt was recorded a few weeks ago at the comedy cellar in front of the same brick wall that Lucy case stood in front of when he returned to stand up stage\nUm now I I Want you to know that TED Talks about the sexual assaults in the ... that we are committed by sea Kerry and by fellow comic Bill Cosby", "show_name": "Bullseye", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
