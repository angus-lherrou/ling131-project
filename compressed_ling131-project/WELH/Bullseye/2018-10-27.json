[laughter]\nSo um we were trying to think of what to do and I I just said well we should end with a strong you know she'll be like a cheery ... you know a lot but looking on the bright side because it's it's terribly ironic you caught and I should look on the bright side when you are being crucified there's not a lot to look forward to it so it is a sort of dug\nUp to ... in in the context of the movie but seems to be ... did it for reality just got nice\nTalking about beginnings for a second I didn't know much about the circumstances of your early life can you tell me about how you came to ship off to\nI was I Wish I was born in in in World War two and a [noise] uh the end of World War two Ninety five my father was still in the hour F ... been since Nineteen forty one and they told everybody hitchhike hope for for the holidays and\nHe got a ride and he was in the truck which shrugged off the road and loaded crushed him and he actually died in hospital on Christmas Eve which is a kind of supporting it seemed running but\nUm I was only two and a half so it's that's something that I experienced afterwards and through the absence of my mother's in extraordinary grief in reaction to that I think she disappeared into a depression for a while\nUm and then you know she she uh she got back [laughter] and ah ... then I I think I went to school in the other side of the ... the opposite live a pool I'm In wall a C and then\nIt was too much you know I was about seven and an unruly seven year old boy if you're trying to keep a fulltime job isn't us what she was\nSo the the R. E. F. very constantly stuck me into a a semi orphanage um which we had been an orphanage and now I went to school rather bizarre holiday with all the boys you know one of my father\nSaid oh like literally this was a school that had been in an orphanage yes weeks before you got there like the big the big change over there like well we're going to send a bunch of kids who lost a parent right in the war rights to the school right courtesy of you are at the royal air wars\nShow so they paid for my education which is very nice of them um but it was kind of sort of thing you notice she don't go by the way you have a ... do you have to stand up now on you and they certainly afterwards in hindsight you realize well that's kind of peculiar\nSelf selected group of people how how hard\nMust not have made us we have free and they didn't have any idea of what a father walls or even discipline so we were kind of a bit unruly and kinda sneaky I'm anti authoritarian and I think that was very useful for ... what kind of relationship did you have with your mom when you were a kid and teenager\nWell they intermittent because the terms were fourteen weeks\nSo you were gone you know the school was the oval role life and then there were moments of kind of oh we can go home now\nUm for for the holiday she got three weeks here two weeks that eight weeks in the summer and that was kind of wonderful and luxurious but then you're back to this thing you know a\n... you know I [laughter] it's all discipline and very\nLittle good things came of it for example I'd read everything by the time I didn't plan for university I was way ahead of people who are having a decent life and going out with teenage girls and enjoy the early sixties I we've had nothing we were just doing homework and perhaps you know all all evening so [noise]\nUm it helped me get on to the next stage and she was very useful you\nWere a good student do I mean despite all that unusual stuff\nI think because of a sudden stage of education it's own down to what you do show like we call it a level which is from sixteen to Eighteen or Nineteen you do these advanced uh exams and that's all self flooding so I did history and literature and geography older which I Love doing\nOur funding comes from the Croft academy\nAn honor is level Seventy two students private middle school opening next fall located on the east side of Providence information and applications at the ... school dot org\nI don't know what to make the news is it politically inflict it is it still ... these are just plain them true on the media helps you keep covering the news media revealed the process behind the story because they're sometimes as much to be learned from the ...\nTomorrow morning et cetera and I'm not public radio eighty nine points three at farm\n[noise] Hi I'm ... productions of your maximum fund or support for NPR comes from NPR member stations and\nThe ... foundation working to improve postsecondary educational outcomes for under certain students through evidence based innovation learn more at ease the emcee foundation dot org [noise]\nThe NPR wind clubs where members receive NPR inspired wind like we can edition cabernet and wait wait don't tell me Murillo available to adults Twenty one years or older learn more at NPR One club or [noise] this is NPR [noise]\nWelcome back to ... I'm Jesse Thor and my guest Eric Idle is a founding member of Monty Python you start and movies like the holy grail and the life of Brian and so many more he's got a new book out it's called always look on the bright side of life a sort of biography [noise] um\nWhen you write a memoir ... one of the things that you have to deal with is the important people in your life who you are I'm remembering after they're passing was added difficult part of writing the book\nWas it was the hardest part I realized I mean I what I did this I sent out to write this story and I didn't want to go to a publisher I ...\nHe writes how I wanted to write to us\nOn just let's see what it what happens why does he go to what subjects do I find [noise]\nAnd then off to bed I realized that I had been avoiding dealing with some people I knew who recently passed and I was taking the Robin I haven't face the fact that I really didn't believe he was dead it totally and I owed it to him to write about him because I've known him since Nineteen eighty and we've been very close\nUm to write something about him and says this is science fresh wants to kind of an extraordinary person he was and so that was sort of hard to do\nBut that was the that's the discipline of when you come back to a thing you try and put some shape into its ... knees what's missing ... can you put into the cake you know that make it make it better as a book\nWhen you did that when you're engaged with I mean Robin Williams is one of the people [noise] George Harrison is whether folks that you write about um Graham Chapman although Chapman has you know you've covered in many more python centric things in the book [noise]\nUm yeah how do how do you feel differently about they're passing as they you know as a guy in his mid seventies like as a person who has a lot to retrospect about\nWhat you look around and suddenly all the people I found really funny and really great for going to dinner or I've gone Garry Shandling all Carrie Fisher I'm Mike Nichols you know they they you know and that's something that is oh I get it so what wait so the death thing that that does apply then okay\nUm and you know I think the fact is that you just it'd be ... to ... put things into perspective and then you know I like to encourage young people um and\nJust you know ... to write about people I Want you to write about titles lights um\nWhat's that looking straight she broke eminent Victorians and it's an ambulance Elizabethan but uh I I I like the idea of writing about ... says people who who you knew or have some insight into I think that's that's interesting for people and it's also interesting for me to write about\nIs the fiftieth anniversary of python coming up and you've done what you say will be your\nLast shows [laughter] um and you know you just wrote your memoir like you're in you're in looking back mode right do you still look forward to to still make the kinds of plants that you made ten years ago or Twenty years ago or fifty years ago\nNo I mainly ones is over or read the books and [laughter]\nThey're like a child you know [laughter] but um we can't do it again because sadly Terry Jones is not able to do it again and then so that's just a few of his left able and it wouldn't be the same I think we did a big show in a big fat well\nWe have a little we may have some surprises up our sleeves but um it will be certainly\nNot us particularly performing it will be encouraging other things to take place I think that's the best I can express it um [noise]\nYou know ... fifty it's it's not our anniversary is sick or somebody else's wedding anniversary [laughter] it's a very strange one but I thought I Would write my book because when you want to be honest questions so I wanted to see what I could remember while I still haven't forgotten\nDo you think of it all differently now than you did Twenty years ago or even like I'm Talking about after the movies were made and so on and so forth but still a long time ago\nVery long time ago and it just it's amazing to me because it just seems to get bigger I mean it doesn't seem to ... becomes more ... in the end you just you know well what can you do\nBe grateful for all those wonderful people that you met along the way and all the many laugh we were doing comedy so we have to not a bloody laptops and that's really writes\nEric I'm so grateful that you came here to be on ball that it's real honor to have you on the show and thank you for that impact thanks for your amazing work that's meant so much to me in so

New Jersey to New York that's so then\nI guess in terms of just like places are on the outskirts of major cities\nAnd write what that kind of breeds in culture and uh yeah I mean people I mean it's it's it's kind of a weird place I mean I mean you know actually that mental ...\nThings in Phoenix I tend to make actually these like playlists and mix tapes for myself of other people's music that\nIs feeding into it but then within that I've I find I see the things I'm missing or the things I Want to\nFeel an and meld together so that's kind of forming but it like the music and that doesn't exist you know I guess I had this kind of thing and then I'm rice in words down so I saw a rise of woods and then I kind of like\nKind of work it out like I have an idea of well I think a checklist and would be so I knew I wanted to open or I could I knew the change I wanted to go for in the middle and I kind of knew how to end it and then I kind of like fit it in and I make that moods\nYou know [laughter] it's kind of a weird way and so old attracts tend to actually finish\nAt the same time in the mix and versus region when I'm ... makes in record will just before that the\n... start to finish because it's hard for me to finish track to if I Know I haven't finished check three so it's really rare that like I could play a track to someone but\nI'll feel weird about it 'cause I Know that it needs to it it it's all going to affect everything else so they they tend to hit the finish line at the same time\nWe'll wrap up my conversation with Deb Heinz after a break silicon what's it like when did he has your phone number in return your calls ... the answer ... from Maxwell von dot org and NPR\nLyndon southeastern Massachusetts is just a public radio eighty nine point three at them [noise]\nOur funding comes from the Gordon School [noise]\nCommitted to a progressive academic programmed to empower young learners to advocate confidently for themselves and others\nOpen house November third\nGordon School dot org [noise]\nWhat have you always wondering about Rhode Island or south eastern Massachusetts who's really behind that piece of legislation what happened to the race to the top grant money why do some streets changed names every few blocks to build that amphitheater in ... ask your question big or small fry new feature the butler\nYou ask the questions and then our reporters lead for the answers ask away at the public's radio\nDot org slash the ... that's the public's radio dot O.
