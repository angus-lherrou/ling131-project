[noise]\nComing up\nWe'll talk to Sarah Jessica Parker about her role story and the HBO series divorce she'll tell me about where she got the inspiration for shows town [noise]\nSeventies cinema was the central inspiration from me I mean that's what I kept surfing around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and you know all the great movie from the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play it's really important role\nBut I imagine that that music with the music as separate young people they fell in love to you know fence\nLater frisk gathered for talk with him about his one man show career suicide you also tell me why she thinks there's no worse fate for a ... than being just okay for the fall on my face for people to watch me get caught I Want people to watch me just get blindsided by the failure of my own idea\nI Want to either succeed big or sell hard then finally I'll tell you why fall Simon's Graceland is a perfect record for middle age it's all coming up on both sides let's go [noise]\nOoh ooh\n\nIt's bull's eye I'm Jesse Thorn in a resume that has spent decades Sarah Jessica Parker has performed some of the most\nHer career adjust Fifteen starring on the CBS teenage comedy square pegs from there she appeared in movies like footloose LA Story and hocus pocus and there's also some show called sex in the city no big deal\nWhen I talked with her a couple of years ago she just launched another new show on HBO it's called divorce its second season wrapped up earlier this year they're working on a third one now\nIt's a drama to it that talks about the end of a marriage and the wreckage and reverse that you find in its wake Sarah plays France as a corporate recruiter who's been with her husband Robert played by Thomas Hayden church for Seventeen years church and Parker\nDon't really want to call it chemistry since they're splitting up on the show but there was something compelling by the way they interact on screen\nThe series takes on topics like commitment fidelity even finances in a very Frank and sometimes very funny way\nHere's a little bit from the first season of divorce in this scene from the show's pilot Francis gives her husband the news\n[noise] you spent last Christmas fishing in Alaska\nNow hang on a second that's the only time of year that the Chinook salmon run in those numbers and you said you didn't mind\nI didn't mind it was the best Christmas I have had in years You're welcome sometimes I come home from work I'm happy\nActually feel happy\nWhen I see your high there are parts that I realize you're home\nThink [noise]\nThis is about my own job is and what this is I Want to save my life while I still care about it\nI don't love you anymore\n\nI Want a divorce\nSarah Jessica Parker welcome to both say\nThank you thank you so much for having me\nI Want to ask you something um with a serious to begin with which is I had this experience or a couple of years ago where a a pair of good friends of myself and my wife\nA split up they were married and um my my own parents were divorced when I was very young and I you know I always thought of as for the better I mean they didn't get along um but when these friends of mine were splitting up\nUh I sort of freaked out\n[laughter] I was really legitimately freaking out about it these people lived three thousand miles from me [laughter] that guy who died care about the very much but they I see them once a year [laughter] right\nAnd a eight or it occurred to me like how intense\nI just I guess I just never acts I just walled off that part of my ... my life experience mhm and the wall just crumbled all in one go [laughter] mhm um and I wonder what it's like for you to\nLive with the way that you live with this subject when you're making a TV show\nLive with divorce you know every day when you go to the office\nYeah [noise] um the experiences I'm not I'm not a personal exploration for me you know I in terms of trying to sort out my own home life but rather\nI guess in some ways what you described as witnessing your friends marriage fell apart you know for me\nIt's a fascinating way to spend a lot of hours because [noise] I I guess\nThing this show was because I I I like yourself I was watching friends marriage a fall apart I was witnessing friends um contemplate affairs\nFriends have affairs marriage survives affairs marriage be better for having ... having one party or having a fair you know I um people contemplating divorced not divorce and all those things that surround\nUm surround you when you reach a certain point in your life and people have been in committed relationships meaningful\nSubstantive relationships and I liked very much exploring it it's the exact way I wanted to do it it's the tone that I was hoping for\nBecause it's for some it's devastating for others it's I'm an opportunity to sort of um make alliances um and I think it's really complex I think people's reactions to divorce when it's not their own are really\nOften surprising to themselves\nDoes it does it freak you out I mean the the like ways when you spend time with it in your heart do you do you feel freaked out and I don't mean like\nIn the sense liquor does it make you feel like a you and your husband are going to get divorced um but like it's it's like an extra central dread for me [laughter]\n[noise] I think I think it doesn't freak me out sometimes it makes me very sad um and I'm I'm\nI I don't know I'm not I'm not freaked out by it because it's both\nAn artistic an academic exercise in some ways and for me I guess I've been an actor for so long that I\nUm I have found a way to compartmentalize the work um I also come home to three children in a ... active household and chaos and um I don't I'm not at liberty to let it um\nPenetrate really beyond the threshold in some way of my own home um but I Love the story I like pushing on the bruise I I've always been that way and um\nI I'm much more interested in the potential to be freaked out than not\nI Want to play a pushing on the Bruce scene from divorce\nSo ah your character whose name is Francis is a head hunter and this is the this is the cold open to the third episode and she's sitting down with a client who's looking for a new good um and they have this conversation\nAnd never

[laughter]\nI ... I since I had a whole\nConversation wheelchair and working on the show really wondering a couple of months ago but she had an extensive conversation about backstage I Am ready to make out with him [laughter]\nLike the Iraqi look so heads of wood that moustache me too I think it's so great and so and it is also a little bit is both incredibly wide dashing and handsome and a little ridiculous [noise] William and Mary ... is that really helps define that character who has those qualities\nAt top totally absolutely and I will say one other thing which fits into this idea of when we were in ... for the show and in fact earlier than that I started thinking about\nWhat I Hope this show would look like cinematic ally and and what I wanted the music to look like and the costumes and\nSeventies cinema played\nWas the central ... inspiration from me I mean that's what I kept circling around and I encouraged everybody else to circle around and um you know all the great movies in the seventies and how they were shot and music from the seventies I wanted that to not only play a really important role um but I imagine that that\nMusic was the music as separate young people they fell in love\nTo you know a first kiss um you know skipping school all these things that were um narrated by seventies music and um you know Albert will ski and all the great costume designers and and so this moustache\nWas ... it did so beautifully into those ideas and just glimpses of things that show is not a period piece um but it is we help tell it with music from the seventies and even there are composer I really wanted him to find ways of I'm using the flute\nUm because I felt like it had been ignored for too long and [laughter] I Love the sound and it's so evocative and anybody of a certain age group or\nWho was interested in music would have a reaction not just to the obviously to the source music but to the compose music as well so the moustache\nWas this gift because it was it so beautifully fit into these ideas\nWell they're just good worker or I'm I'm Out of time with you but I'm so grateful that or you came in to talk to us or I really appreciate you taking the time\nOh it's been such a treat and you just did not let me down at all and you\nAsk such good smart interesting questions and it's been a real privilege to have time with you so thank you so much [noise]\nSarah Jessica Parker you can currently watching the first two\nGo she's also starring in in producing a new movie called here and now that set to hit theaters November ninth [noise]\nGets bull's eye I'm Jesse born my next guest is Chris gathered Chris was of course the host of the legendary Chris get their show\nIt aired first on New York city public access television then later on the networks fusion you might have also seen him on broad city or you don't think twice the microbe ugly improv movie\nCritic is also a stand up and when we talk you've done a really interesting special it's called career suicide it's kind of a one man show gathered produced it would Judd Apatow\nGenuinely moving special got their talks very specifically about alcoholism about depression and even death but he does it in ways that are totally human very identifiable very funny\nOf course has a new book coming out it's called lose well and it's sort of a self help book he talks about the lessons that he's learned in life shortcomings and successes in show business stories of family and friends and there's even a section on his high school band\nThe lesson if you really want to be good at anything you're going to fail and if you want to do the right way to fail Chris gathered has some advice anyway let's take a listen to a little bit from the one man show here he's talking about his early days in show business running from audition to audition to get bit parts in commercials\nI start getting acting work I'm getting most of the commercials mostly commercials if you start to my name I Need to to this day you go deep enough and the search results still finding very annoying commercial for H R Block where I where later I was\nI once audition price subway sandwich commercial to play the role now who is on attracted to women [noise]\nThat is a character named ...\nI couldn't even call them die or something like [noise]\nI didn't vote that part I'm assuming because [noise]\nChris gathered welcome back to bull's eye it's good to see a great to see you too so\nYour new special or one man show or whatever you want to call it was called career suicide it's largely about your mental health do you feel exhausted by talking\nAbout here [laughter] you know what I mean one hundred percent yeah one of the great things about the special coming out is that maybe I could talk about I can stop [laughter] everything I have to say about it is in that special and when I get asked about it I can just\nTell people you know I find it out all your uh HBO driven streaming platform for it 'cause that's really what I have to say about it um 'cause it has been many years of talking about it in some form or another and and definitely it's exhausting and doing the show more exhausting than I thought for sure\nHe feels like part of what you're doing in the special and also in your memoir which was the last time you're on the show I think is in writing about it I mean performing about it you are talking yourself into engaging with it fully\nI think that's a very astute observation and then there's like definitely a part of me that knows that if it's not hidden it has less power over me if it's not something I'm trying to\nYou know overcome quietly in private than other people might actually help and there's something he said to for you know anytime I anytime I put it out there and and other people respond to it like it sometimes people you know people have seen the show and the weight afterwards and say oh like I really identify with that thank you for ...\nWhat are the things you talked about in your special show\nFor suicide is the extent to which you had linked to your emotional health to\nYour career this presumption that if your career was successful that you would be a Russian ally healthy because of that yeah um two part question do you feel differently about that now are you able to feel differently about that the second part is\nDo you think you would feel comfortable doing work in your career that was good work but not capital G. capital W good works you know what I mean might just if you were like\nIf you got cast on\nAs the second guy in a funny sitcom and you were doing a good job of that yeah and the sitcom wasn't evil but neither was it a place for teenagers to come out right\nRight it was a it wasn't A Guided by this sense of urgency or a\nChip on his shoulder that my work clearly has now at it like I'm definitely a workaholic its problems\nIt's probably like one of the biggest things are still wrap my head around is that I get caught too caught up in career stuff you know a lot of that is that there's the anxiety that it could all go it tomorrow which could getting better about that you know have a little bit more stability and they've ever had before\nThat's a nice feeling but it still is this thing I have to remind myself of ... I always had this feeling of like uh\nEverybody has to notice it and I have to admit that I was right going for this and they'll have to admit that I have what it takes\nWhich pre suppose that they were all these people doubting me which was not really true like I had this chip on my shoulder about proving everybody wrong and then I Would accomplish certain things and I wouldn't feel that validation I had to kind of a cop to the fact is like\nThat it's there is no them that I can prove wrong and then there'll be this victory like something's going on inside actually wants to witness that ask cat New York backstage at UCD and there was a friend of mine who was a cast member and is now talking to a friend of mine who was a correspondent on the Daily Show\nAnd they were stressing so hard man I don't know what's going on and we're going to get with my next gig ... might have to move across the country and there are so stressed and I was like man I always figured if I got one of those jobs I'd be happy\nYou're in the Daily Show you're on SNL you've reached the mountaintop now you can kick back 'cause you've proven everything you need to prove and I was like oh they're still so stressed out\nI have no hope\nSo I better just learned to enjoy the things I Do because getting stuff is not going to fix any my problems as far as I could I you know\nCould I settled in and really enjoy it if I was doing something that was maybe a little more square some of the er standard you could say some of the stuff I've done I don't know like\nI mean you could be for you could be the next thirty rock throwing rocks the funniest show great shows more funding they said that Joe than there isn't but if I'm not about it's not about much more than being in front of it is about some of it yeah I'm not trying to diminish thirty ride when my favorite shows of all time course\nBut it doesn't have that fire and it's got trying to prove something [laughter] they've got to have their mission statement of trying to like break the system sneak in the back to\nI feel like I probably could I imagine you know I I think hard about it because there's all there's a part of me that's also like if something like that would have happened like I don't think anybody's going to doubt that I tried at this point you know always doubting ... or my indie credibility at this point like\nI think anyone who knows my work would say that guy spent\nYears bending over backwards to try to do this thing and that time he was the only one who knew why he kept going at times I had a visibly quit and other people fans rather be working on the show would convince me to keep going so there's a part of me that's like at a certain point\nI've done my part and maybe I couldn't move on and just do something I uh ... sure I'd find some side project very quickly to um push the buttons that\nFuel a lot of my my ... one of the things that makes me want to keep up accomplishing stuff is you know you see people in this industry who eventually get to a point where they can produce other people's work\nAnd I'm not quite there yet but I Would love to be because I I feel like one of the things that I have going right now is I remember what it was like for me seven eight nine ten years ago when nobody\nWas particularly interested in had to just like kicked out some doors and make it happen for myself I'd love to find the comedians who are in that spot and help them do not have to spend half a decade on public access TV to make it happen so that's\nAnother thing is like maybe if I was to get one of those bigger jobs that could give me that credibility that could bring some other stuff into the world but who knows I don't know I'll sell out some day everybody does write ups\nIs bull's eye I'm Jesse for I'm Talking with the comedian Chris gathered about his special career suicide you can watch it on HBO Now friend of mine was telling me this past week it has a friend who sold the company for sixty five million dollars and he said this to me as a kind of war is sort of my friends\nHe does is make bad art and I was like the dream ... bad art yeah\nI mean that's already make it better also had been doing for years [laughter] yeah [laughter] not really getting paid that well for him yeah certainly don't have sixty five million dollars [laughter] I don't have to find a market for my bad art that's perfect\nYeah it is funny they're talking about the idea of moving on its you know the gathered show when I talk about the get their show for years that has been my people and they're still my people\nTheir punk kids they're weirdos they're artists\nA lot of them are clear a lot of them are doing things their own way you know a lot of them either by choice or by necessity or people who have walked their own path and they find this and it's like oh this is a community of people there aren't that it's a beautiful thing I'm very very proud of it those are my people but it's funny\nThey are so why is that like I get the sense\nOnline sometimes I'm really in tune with these people\nThis past week I was in a fight with my own thing club I might they banned they shut they stopped comments on my post and the Facebook group that's my ... to get the ads and I was honestly mad about it and they were like we don't care where shutting down like I have this contentious relationship and I get the sense\nSometimes that like they are such underground people and so passionate about the values of that\nDebt me being in ... his movie is a little bit of a sellout [laughter] beautiful anonymous pod a pod cast they're like you're getting a little too mainstream for us buddy and there's almost like a counter cultural element to the gathered show where I have to grow and I have to evolve\nAnd I'm In ... it's a very fascinating thing to realize I don't know if they want me to and that's a very odd feeling very odd feeling I can steal them being happy for it but I can also feel to feel a lot of my older school fans feeling like man like he's really\nHe's really growing up and moving on and I don't know exactly how to handle that because I feel like that's what I've always been working towards is trying to get a better head on my shoulders it's weird I don't know how to go\nI'm heading you know especially thinking about H. B. O. like that's a more a bigger platform than I've ever had your ... name before you're yeah sleepover your credit pretty fancy stuff how much longer can I claim to be this rebel tried to uh throw rocks from outside the house you know\nI don't know how much longer people are going to buy that but I don't really know what else I Am\nAre you worried that you're not going to get get that some might show and you're going to have to move to CBS andme enlarge the ban\nOh my God that what you're on bigger theatre [laughter] follow that man's life I Would be very often\nI don't know I just read a biography of Batman the lifestyle that horrible ...\nI can only talk about what I what I witnessed as a consumer of pop culture all ready to the junior senator yeah most brilliant out Fox genius um [laughter] ... has been thrilled about no far as the things we read about the actual um loneliness that doesn't seem great\nBut I I think a lot of that if he would be proud of the crews gathered show that's like a major\nConcern of mine is like if footage of this ever went across David Letterman's desk would he be sites because in my mind a lot of what's behind it is\nNot talking bad about anybody but late night just used to be a lot weirder I think it just used to be weirder he was weird cone instills weird even Carson had a lot of weird stuff on there who used to be this element to it where it would get a little chaotic unpredictable and now in my opinion\nBut I Want my show it to be an hour of just that\nLetterman you sometimes just like get a permit to shut down the block so he could pour ten thousand rubber balls off the roof of his duty onto the street and that was no thought about it beyond that\nLet's just send the guy into the deli across the street with a camera so I can talk to the deli guy know planning beyond that is we're not scripted rubber the deli man as to say certainly you know let's bring Harvey Coloradans get an actual fight attempts", "show_name": "Bullseye", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
