about\nGerrymandering and Pennsylvania is adventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation here in the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm joined here today by Lindsey lives our species a multimedia journalists were WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords and media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because\nUh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court ah and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino to Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and\nYou know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a ... he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen ruin a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he\nFollowed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere's nothing in Pennsylvania ... which says and not have to be fair whatever fair me to these judges took it upon themselves to say fairness I mean you know what we think it means and they drew in the process what was one analyst called the Democrats dream that\nSo it was a it was just such a [noise] it was just a take and unconstitutional taking of power by the ...\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives are ski let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when did Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out\nAnd so the timelines here was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of their right to free an equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislatures that OK guys you know give us your best shot that didn't happen and we ...\nDifferent groups handing in math and just this Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes the governor was supposed to approve 'em the map that the legislature um came up with it didn't have that didn't have\nThe first of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders did that was never passed by the general assembly\nThe form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court in all fairness to both sides of Supreme Court did not give a legislature I think adequate time to come up with a map even from the legislature could've come up with a map when when I met up and they went back to\nThis a clause in the constitution known as free in equal yeah which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong a merely suggesting\nThat they went back into a the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find that\nThere yeah let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because\nThey saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but the Terry's indicating here that but this was a a novel reading overly ... well I think you also have\nTo look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making the decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean they ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and are going into the federal court it could have going on and on and on for a relatively long period of time it was at work its way up to the to the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge off of you know different theory in the federal courts that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nOkay so there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now on that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty something seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nNow but the reason why I wanted to come here because I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether you know gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering\nWill we get more moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend\nTo to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper\nPolarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and here's what some voters in ... valley told us about what they see\nFavorite place for you for the church and uh\nThere's pumpkin pie pastry and pulled pork on the table at the Chapman quarries United Methodist church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidates Marty no Stein a bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled walls reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the road a volunteer has set up a life sized cut out of President Trump giving a thumbs up\nAnd greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign of a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals the Lehigh Valley was previously split into a long lobster shapes district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nHis old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight points Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nI like to think of the valley is a microcosm of the United states blue dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we've tried about\nRogers calls no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate won a cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics\nNo Stein also advocates were strict term limits but he falls in line with a GOP on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNew Stein is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and greet\nHe's not a pie in the sky conservative there's people who are just the idea logs and he is not an ideologue he is a working man\nSo I ask Nicholas question does she think political compromise may be possible in her newly balance district\nYou will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the global is\nNicholas says there's another divide she thinks Democrats are encouraging a sense of victimization and women other women at the table not in agreement\nFor Dr Ford I think she was victimized but she came across as poor me that would not have been our response not by any means we refused to be victims we we would have been angry\nAnd yet when he closed does not approve of the fact that millions of women and men are angry right now and they're taking action\nThey're marching in the streets and protesting on Capitol Hill but to Nicholas that kind of anger isn't becoming it's not viable she says Ryan Rogers Marty no signs campaign staffer puts it this way\nI think that ultimately will come down to just the contrast of candidates a RO thing has been results versus resistance\nRunning in the streets wearing sleeping cash\n...\nSupport for on point comes from Charles River apparel making the new Englander rain jacket

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call [noise] um I I'm from a you love this district in Pennsylvania just king is running and um I also helped I also did some volunteer work for a\nShort Scott in the a tense district and I was happy to see these two districts are now competitive especially the the ... district but um\nI'd really like to see Pennsylvania move further in this direction and make it more fair mhm\nAnd I really wonder why should this be more of a mathematical\nModel a procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to top left or the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population and the counties in Judea boundaries\nRight it's a good question Jason and I mean Lindsey lives are even phones issue for a long time what do you think\nYeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling um you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that you know a congressional districts need to be ... compact they need to be continuous\nIt's possible and that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that you know I'm\nGoing forward or the ruling does say that there are these new choke ... here that needs to be considered before part is concerned but you know the quick ... goes so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes to part is and so there's it's today but there there are some guidelines that you know or the legislature can use going forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the point that the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of out of district ... or politics always going to be part of this process\nOr I don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both tried to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre and these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better a jury may during because of the nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level\nYou and I just said not the district or the ward level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nOther one still has to set the rules for the algorithm and when I was thinking we think computers\nCan do it better out let's take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call I Lived in northern Sonoma County that's the Akron Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican\nGovernor and Republican Congress and they are about three years ago they came over and ... northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressman ... when they see\nAnd it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our Democratic Congress\n... you may I made a thing to go ahead whom and how to make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just\nThat the Republicans picked up sixty three house seats or put it another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats\nBut that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has done by law\nBut when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state that has a huge difference on writing the laws\nOf each day you know that government was drinking yeah exactly and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election was huge not just in terms of the\nBringing the Tea Party to power the ideological conservatism that represents\nGo ahead Lindsey yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the laws they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined the Democrats would do ... being nonpartisan about a year not parties and but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there is a district in Maryland yeah yeah so this is not part is in both parties will do\nThat well that's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very ...\nPower but but you know when Republicans do it on a ... have they have done here in Pennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere to people keep talking to me about Marilyn a California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to them and let me let me play for you I'm\nA a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's the GOP chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just take he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second he poses other systems to drop future congressional maps and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best position to draw a line than they are today heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation\nThat draws party you know political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps of their favors and other states like Maryland so you know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder fair disturbing plan they called it to take back\nThe rational seats and they've done it here in Pennsylvania that's\nAbout the Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair citizens' lives are he's ... he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps but there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania I just have\nTo say I love that um operatic music behind fail Columbus Day festival here in Philadelphia was picking me there to south Philly um so\nYou know a a group a in Pennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement an independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they've modeled this after California\nAnd um this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them at events canvassing and you know ah they they ... they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interests to form this commission\nAs you pointed out if there is a such a commission in California and made up of a appointed independent citizens and I think some several other a couple of other states in the west have similar similar commission so who do they work so have they created fair districts\nUm if you talk to the the people on the commission yes if you talk to voters yes I think a key difference between Pennsylvania in California is that in Pennsylvania\nUm there's no referendum so basically um to get that process in place at the state legislature would have to pass a constitutional amendment and then it would go to the voters for in a referendum\nAnd there's no guarantee there's no guarantee that an independent commission itself will be truly independent I mean they have to be offended by somebody other than that that's or or hold positions by virtue\nGet on to get on the commission by virtue of a position they already hall or you could have state lawmaker leaders of point of view you could have different

dire new report and it's based on more than six thousand sided studies written by Ninety One authors from forty different countries\nAnd saying that if we continue on the path that we are now globally\nThat the devastation that climate change could cause would change human civilization permanently I'm joined today by Chris Mooney covers climate change energy and the environment for the Washington Post ... also joined us he's professor of climate sciences at Duke University and was one of the authors on yesterday's report by the inter governmental panel on climate change\nAnd we want to hear from you where it eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk a and Christian drew I just want to play us a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski scientist and lead author of the ... the the report\nAnd he said that we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at lots of it\nBut learning that doing so well also have some consequences\nTo limit more than ... to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this include planting trees bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage changed land management as well as some normal approaches that sort of very early stages of development\nHowever carbon dioxide removal on a large scale could have implications for food security for ecosystems for bio diversity\nThat's Jim ski scientist and lead author of the PCC report\nChris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as as ski talks about there but it's this it's when he said that um remove a lot of large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about what\nHe's talking about is this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that emissions has to be cut at of extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry\nThe polls carbon monoxide out of the air and this doesn't exist now so people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies and in climate models and one of the ways in which they have imagined it a involves planting huge essentially plantations\nOf trees are crops in using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they were burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plants and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food uh so what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze should know that sounds like a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I think that taking the risk that we can admit more carbon now and we will make up for it later bye\nTo you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this is a enormous gamble with the future of our whole planet and and I think you know where the turning over a large portion of our arable land\nTo grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer has enormous implications for biodiversity inability to defeat the planet and so if we cut our missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios to do this and the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carbon removals you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon remove all that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires\nThe most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon of any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying well with some of that tree planting globally uh be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\nThat would generally be restoring abandon lay on marginal lands on how we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away with out really compromising most of our arable land\nOkay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting ... near the aggressive emissions cutting scenarios that you're talking about are they going into that they're just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an ... an issue that affects us also let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question\nSorry my question is when the people that are profiting from the destruction of then later on then they go ... or whatnot when will they be held accountable like the conversation very scary but I never hear anyone who make the money out of\nAnd so I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nTaxes or something that fund programs or the thing the actions taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes and just just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking income taxes or something or attack people make millions off of oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean among the first of all thank you for your call in because many do you have a response from her for her\nWell [noise] I don't know I I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change is the consequence of industrial civilization it's the consequences of all of us\nAre deciding you adopt the technologies that we created um that make our lives better a driving you know cheating your home cooling your home and many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy is mostly burn fossil fuels so the way that we live\nAnd the scale at which we are\nUsing energy is really a what's at stake here um so yes there's companies that sell energy at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently um so\n... do pick up on that thought because I mean I think Christmas exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're saying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible\nWell ... there is\nNo people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also an indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies an automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry\nAnd this was a measure that would nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they got the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with out\nEven counting for the environmental costs so what's happening in reality is that we all pickup these costs no more than a hundred billion a year in disaster relief expenditures everybody's health care premiums go up when people suffer from heat waves and suffer from air pollution and so\nThese companies really are profiting\nBy imposing a hidden tax on every other part of American business and American consumers and I think until we do change that like something you said may not a carbon tax that really reflects the true cost of these activities we're not going to make the ships that are necessary\nLet's go to Larry who's calling from middle field Connecticut where you're on the air\nI\nI'm just want to mention that I work for a company in national company and although we pulled out of the climate agreement Paris which I disagree with and um [noise]\nThe government itself is spending billions of dollars upgrading for energy efficiency conservation I'm from Fort Greely Alaska\nDown to told an Airforce

Intergovernmental Panel on climate change is new report\nAbout what the future will hold if we continue emitting carbon dioxide into the air the rates that we are now and how much of a change civilization ... level change humanity is going to have to undergo in order to get a hold\nOn a climate affects or carbons effect on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he is lead author of the eye PCC report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fought the evidence the calls it up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what he said about global warming\nDog talking about\nAll of this was a global warming and that is a lot of it's a hoax hawks I mean it's a money making industry okay fish out\nThat's December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump or of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's reports\nUh I mean we're two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think\nAbout what the the president's attitude was about global warming\n... unfortunately well he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both parties supportive environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIt's more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're toting things like creating coal jobs even those renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm coldest is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fuels just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace\nChris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a from above a response to the PCs report a yes we have statements from state to ...\nActually I'm ... wheeler you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world the below a dangerous level of climate change and ah he didn't identify specific level but he pointed out um that what you guys doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies 'em and these technologies will be exported to other countries are so they're wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard from the world coal association\nOr they're saying that because this report clearly targets colon says we're gonna have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely in what they're saying is actually no we need to create technologies that captured the emissions of calling Barrett blow the ground\nUm so that's one of the angles a that is being taken on the report I'm\nYeah I'm seeing here that the state department official as you're reporting that said that\nQuote governments do not formally indoor specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one percent during the same time so to touting us efforts to to cut emissions there well\nAnd it's it's not incorrect us Americans have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius\nAll right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\n[noise] high magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I guess more like a question ... um I think baking and significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best hope of of actually making change so high and it's like a key campaign like this band\nThat are you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with it unfortunately it's not enough to make a dent on and\nOn the problems that we had in the environment a but it's\nYou know is even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't see a meat from one day is that enough to make a change yeah\nWell ... thank you I'm I'm a I don't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to ... uh individual level efforts a professor she can do is breeze asking could they make a difference\nThey can and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems just some so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking at but what we looked at was people in primarily in the west who eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines\nJust going back to what's best for them right so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge sacrifice we're asking people to do what they should do anyway for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land the deforestation the land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport bus biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport is also good for your health you know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars unless there is charging infrastructure and currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax\nOn electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I uh\nPeople making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners only if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of products so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available let's go to\nKevin who's calling from ... Louisiana Kevin you're on the air\nHello Hi Kevin what does\nThat how you doing I just had a comment to make 'em you know I work in the in all industry\nAnd um there's a lot of infrastructure that's already in place like in the Gulf of Mexico per se those two thousand platforms out there that has jazz jackets and the water might be a little less than that but at least a thousand where wind farms could be adapted to those jackets easily\nI mean but they are naturally infrastructure would have to be built to you know the power generation would give it to the beach\nBut that's something that that could be done also went on when an oil company that does exploration on a certain area\nThey have to mitigate somewhere else it doesn't matter they dropped a drop all they're not if the jeopardy clean the whole time\nThey have to spend money to mitigate another area that needs to mitigate needs restoration mhm so it's it's a balance you know and they do spend money or in to the good I guess some people go to the\nYou know mining industry some people it's bad yeah but we use it we need it you know are just not so much more common\n... Kevin thank you actually so much for your call 'cause many do you want to respond him I think that first part of Kevin's indicating that I mean he's out there working in the Gulf Oil fields saying that there is infrastructure in place if we wanted to to expand a wind generation\nWell there's actually a close relationship between offshore oil and offshore wind I mean you you you find a company like ... um which is a major oil producer now going a very strong into the uh offshore wind industry and that sort of the deep\nOffshore wind industry which is where you need really really powerful infrastructure and where some of the most powerful when can be harnessed and if you can get it to shore than you can get yourself quite a lot of renewable energy I think I think it goes to show that there is a corporate transition that's happening right now again the it's not at the pace\nOr that the one point five see report calls for right but there's all kinds of action happening it's just the question is can it somehow be be Marshall across the globe um when policies that are unified by all the governments and that's that's really what this report is asking\nIs Rhode Island public radio

a rock climbing walls and he did it with no ropes\nThat effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy Chin and Alex ...\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climbed you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move 'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about with the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I Move my body\nBut then you know from my note for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep us you know the rest of the picture I could just count on myself to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole whole face so many times that I kind of just remembered most of it\nOr you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay uh so what so this is part of what the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental armor what is\nI actually um I actually don't call the mental owners are not in the film Tommy says that a few times and he's\nThey're climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor but um but actually a big part of the process for me to be able to free solo cap was to sort of get past that I think that you like the idea of mental farmers to to sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like it's it's something that's too scary you sort of get psyched up and like\nShield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like that wasn't really a a sustainable way to climb oh crap I get is just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that that at some point you know it's sort of\nCome to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Am me the wall to wall and I'm and I am capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus in ways that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's kinda that's that's basically the the film and two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to feel comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I've been dreaming about it and thinking about it and climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I couldn't talk to you for the whole hour about the technical have preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ... but ...\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free so many of them have died and then that is shown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climate Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the deaths of the world's best we still the climbers I think\nEverybody who is made free cell I Am a big part of their life\nJohn back or with a pioneer Web so called free solar climbing she found this past week at the age of fifty two\nWere started to sort of ... and the death of us climate showing Larry\nShow was killed in Utah was found a couple of days ago there were seeing was climbing a new some of the valley his body was found Saturday morning proceed climate as usual alone without road most people that are pushing\nThe limits they have this mentality of screw it whatever happens happens [noise]\nDown there from the documentary free still though I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing was no ropes that has really that really drew you in\nA yeah well yeah I did a good question um I mean basically you know I mean so not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes ... you mean scrambling a beautiful ridge and the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for rope climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing in the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an anti social youngster so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the the feeling of freedom to speed or the efficiency I mean there there's certain joy in in climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing and stone a small fraction of of my normal climbing yeah you know I I\nI climb all styles you know all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various various types of climbing and free zone has always sort of represented this this extra little side\nBut you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean yeah you don't know\nPart of crime and to me as well you know it's only a small part of our dear okay you know it's always been sort of the most significant and a lot of ways\nTo talk to me about that I mean what is it\nHow is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads are I mean is it is it his own that you just cannot enter or experience in any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience about feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into a feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling a flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you're feeling like you're you're close to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell your ears Wyeth because I mean a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know I'm On in in some beautiful places in the west the United states and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climb that I did that I got a little better and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my like low level climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering mind in ...\nDuring a constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what would I enjoy about free zone is seeking a slightly bigger challenges things that are slightly hurting them where you've done before it's would you feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit better what you do\nBut of course with re sowing though the costs of the mistake of absolute so you know you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but then another to blend\nWell I mean we ... I don't I mean we're all gonna die um I'm trying my best not to dark Carmen ... are very much want to move to old age and her family and all that but um no I mean I I don't\nThink that if I just keep pushing middle for sure dark climate you know some ... tunnel into well\nLet me just reiterate nobody wants that [laughter] but um luckily we get some calls in here because we've got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex or we're speaking with Alex ... he is a professional rock climber a best known\nFor free sewing and in fact he did a free so low Yosemite is el Capitan it's a three thousand foot wall in Yosemite one of the most famous rock climbing walls anywhere in the world he did it without ropes and that story is captured in the documentary free so low which is directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy ... so\nLet's go to Kay who's calling from the new Ohio okay you're on the air\nHi mega ... and ... ... yeah several the questions I was gonna ask Alex about what drives him and that that\nThat edge of a risk and you know that\nThat drive to conquer but I go back and forth from Boulder, Colorado to Ohio and have so for the last forty five years so there's a huge rock climbing community there and about four years ago go at the Boulder film festival they showed about four different documentaries\nOn climbing and so I was around that climbing community there and they did show want documentary on Yosemite Alex it was so fascinating that\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from a guy called offerings that guy called mobile apps that guy comb overlap stores ID cards enables they'll pay and submit policy updates and claimed reports directly from a user cell phone learn more and Geico dot com and college fine\nWe're consulting work with high school students to identify and cheese their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship or more and more at college fine dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a truck or body we're talking this hour with Alex huddled he is a rock climbing superstar and he is the first person in the world to free so low that means without ropes Yosemite is three thousand foot wall el ... and that feed is documented in the new movie free solo which is directed by Elizabeth Chivers Sally and\nJimmy Chin I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor Jane Joseph there who did that an MRI skin of your brain started talking about some of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis that I Am wondering now that you know that about\nUm you know the the shape in response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see a you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nNot particular um yeah I mean in general I have a strong sense of IM me and I am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside I mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but\nUm I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first to scan yeah and um and they take away to me it was basically just the you know practice the that over time you can do some of the things and that's that's very much been my experience\nThat um that you can learn over time that's yeah it was ... I heard that she was at one of the premier is for fear free so loaded up and get to see her rather than ... hours or more actually\nThat I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh\nAnd they just said it was like oh well your brain's effective so obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it or I mean I've always heard it as as you know with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know it's I suppose it's a little bit open ended\nYeah but one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to a collie wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to guess who's calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\nI ... I'm you know it's one thing to watch your preparing to go through their regular on the wall where you are in their every move but there's also the aspect of family and loved ones and I was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you have to prepare\nUm before going out at one of these big feet wiped out and do the photo walked one drink like that ever come into your mind while you're you know and then that's the risk multi thousand for them\nYeah I mean that those and that's probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate it out because in order words reselling it'd be easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis or sort of argued that uh that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level I just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationship\nWell let me ask you was asking though in the middle of a big climb I mean well let's talk about your al ... ascent yes on August ... did you think of her or is what's your brain that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the hardest sections which represents maybe half the route um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing moves and just performing but then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and thinking about friends and partners huh\nI mean I remember specifically on on my free soda cap I spent you know maybe a five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey than than\nYou I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked about my girlfriend uh [laughter] you know when I'm finished\nYeah well I mean as you write in a free solo does the movie does explore um your relationship with Saudi McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free solo climbing\nI Want to like I Want to have my ... you have any more I'm gonna die like minds on do what we want to do over here and then when people die\nFeel like I Want in half way\nAnd when you sound like to take me into the equation [noise] and then Russian than anything to be on with cutting intention actually change when you actually make decisions to me\nI had some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan\nI can do you see that as an obligation\n[noise]\nBut I appreciate your your concerns you know I respect that but but I Know a few obligation now\nIs that true Alex he's still not feel obligated to maximize your life span\nYeah it's kinda hard for me to listen to some of those there's no like oh I mean I have that struggled through the whole film there there's so many section than our whole cringe that's that's pretty that's that was on top or you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there is that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else um I you know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so\nYou know if I'm if I'm thinking about it there's not I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared but\nBut also I mean that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently had for maybe the seven proceeding years\nAnd so I felt like the ratio was was was different you know I mean now we've been in a great relationship for three years and I've you know finish this they climb and so you know moving forward and I'm sure the the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially potential you know so I'm sure you're potentially\nThat well I'm sure it would be different than yeah sure it would be different or I don't know which way\nLet's go to another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nYeah greetings or how you doing a ... all currently Alex you have the uh the mutations climber brain so congratulations I'm a I'm a climber I've\nI did a various things from the early seventies and\nClimbing my greatest accomplishment was a devil's tower in Wyoming\nUm which you know by the easiest thing on it is the hardest thing I can do [laughter] um so you know you you are a Superman and totally insane but when I was there a there was this this kid who is free sewing it\nAnd you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and the end it's actually easier in a lot of ways because it's so much faster and and you don't have to stop importing protection which was really hard and really dangerous I really have been done too much leading and uh\nYou know and I I was I was a ... you know the TV reporter I'd gotten documentaries and uh I really wanted ... documentary on this guy because I thought I thought I was taught your ghost I just didn't think he'd be around and firefighters and but what he did was he actually held off the top of this thing and that's twelve hundred feet\nA vertical crystal on a vertical columns really really difficult it's a thing in close encounters of the third kind and he repelled off the top like foot by foot and a quarter of a mile and clean the whole route with metal toothbrushes and broke off boulders you\nKnow that were exploding like like ... you know blow\nOh and then and then it's an Israeli that they that he then later free claimed yeah\nWondering if you ever had done something that you know incredibly intensive and uh you know I Know you can't yeah it's a very smooth including the hundreds of thousands of people do yeah Dana um\nBut no I I I very much went through that exact same process I mean\nYou know the film free so is is very much about the two years of the center of telling the wall cleaning memorizing holds um you know I don't know if it's actually in the film but I definitely did spend some time removing some loose rocks from from one key section of a crack and on and then I can just throw 'em down and let them it's just obvious that you meet people and he's already but so I put them in ...\nSpent a lot of time you're physically preparing the route because it just young and just have to there are scenes\n\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico

environment for the Washington Post and we have links to his recent reporting at some point radio dot org Chris welcome to the program\nThank you so first of all give us a some of the top line details of what the scientists in a in this IPC the report are saying are they saying that one and a half degrees is not a reasonable goal anymore\nWell they very carefully do not take a stand on that question but they do\nClearly showed that it will be extremely difficult in order to do it essentially you have to do something that humanity hasn't done before which is radically change a major systems how we get energy how we get food how we get around transportation\nHow we build our cities so they once they've described the magnitude of what's required it's reasonable to ask whether it can be done\nOkay so the Paris climate agreement that uh of holding warming to a one and a half degrees or above ... over pre industrial levels was considered to be pretty ambitious to begin with\nSo I mean water scientists saying that we would need ... you are scientist saying that current practices and current plans to meet that goal or not enough uh unequivocal\nEither saying that so they're saying that current promises made by countries ah which they made as part of the Paris Agreement process\nWill give us three degrees Celsius so over five degrees Fahrenheit of warming by the end of the century or then they prepared this report that we are now discussing saying what\nWould have to be done in order to just limited to one point five which is about to point seven degrees Fahrenheit

we're talking about the PCs latest report released yesterday about the consequences of global climate change it's a very dire new report and it's based on more than six thousand sided studies written by Ninety One authors for forty different countries\nAnd saying that if we continue on the path that we are now globally\nThat the devastation that climate change could cause would change human civilization permanently I'm joined today by Chris Mooney covers climate change energy and the environment for the Washington Post juice in del also joined us he's professor of climate sciences at Duke University and was one of the authors on yesterday's report by the inter governmental panel on climate change\nAnd we want to hear from you where it eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk a and Christian drew I just want to play us a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski scientist and lead author of VIP the the report\nAnd he said that we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at lots of it\nBut learning that doing so well also have some consequences\nLimit more than ... to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this include planting trees bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage change lawns management as well as some novel approaches that sort of at a at least stages of development\nHowever carbon dioxide\nAs for food security for ecosystems ... diversity\nThat's Jim ski scientist and lead author of the IPC the report\nChris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as ... as he talks about there but it's this it's when he said that um remove a lot of large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about\nWhat he's talking about is this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that emissions has to be cut at a extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry\nThat pulls carbon monoxide out of the air and this doesn't exist now some people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies in in climate models and one of the ways in which they imagined it a\nInvolves planting huge essentially plantations of trees are crops and using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they're burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plants and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food uh so what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze should know that sounds like a a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I think that taking the risk that we can admit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out of the air\nIs akin to you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this has enormous gamble with the future of our whole planet\nAnd and I think you know ... turning over a large portion of our arable land\nTo grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer has enormous implications for biodiversity inability to feed the planet and so if we cut our missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios that do this and the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carbon removal you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon removal that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires\nThe most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon of any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying well with some of that tree planting globally or be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\nThat would generally be restoring abandoned land marginal lands on how we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away without really compromising most of our arable\nLand okay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting ... near the aggressive emissions cutting scenarios that you're talking about or that you hinted at there and just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an ... an issue with that that affects us all so let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question [noise] sorry my question is when\nThen my arm and I think ... or whatnot when will they be held accountable like the conversation very scary but I never hear anyone who make the money out\nAnd so I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nOur taxes or something to fund programs or the thing the actions taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes and just just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking in fact that there is something that people make billions on oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean my first of all thank you for your call in because many do you have a response from her for her\nWell I I don't know I I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change\nIs the consequence of industrial civilization is the consequences of all of us\nAre deciding you adopt the technologies that we created um that make our lives better or driving you know heating your home schooling her home and many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy is mostly burn fossil fuels so the way that we live\nAnd the scale at which we are\nUsing energy is really what's at stake here um so yes there's companies that sell energy a ... at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently so\nThat ... don't pick up on that thought because I mean I think Christmas exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're saying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible\nWell the there is an indictment and in some sense of people's choices and people consuming too much red meat and\nYou know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also an indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies an automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry\nAnd this was a measure that would nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they got the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with out\nEven counting for the environmental cost so what's happening in reality is that we all pickup these costs you know more than a hundred billion a year in disaster relief expenditures everybody's health care premiums go up when people suffer from heat waves and suffer from air pollution and so\nThese companies really are profiting\nBy imposing a hidden tax on every other part of American business and American consumers and I think until we do change that like something you said many non carbon tax that really reflects the true cost of these activities we're not going to make the shift that aren't necessarily\nLet's go to Larry who's calling from

dioxide into the air the rates that we are now and how much of a change civilization all level change humanity's going to have to undergo in order to get a hold on a climate effects or carbon effect on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he is lead author of the IPC the report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fought the evidence the calls it up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump\nTalking about all of this was the global warming and do that is a lot of it's a hoax hawks I mean it's a money making industry okay it's a house\nThat's December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump or of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's report\nA I mean we're two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think uh about what the the president's attitude was about global warming\nWell unfortunately while he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's not really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both\nParties supported environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIt's more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're toting things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm coldest is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fuels just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace ...\nChris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or ... from above a response to the PCs report\nA yes we have statements from the state department and also I'm from ... acting administrator Andrew wheeler um in our story actually um and we'll or you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world the below a dangerous level of climate change and ah he didn't identify specific level but he pointed out\nUm that what you guys doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies 'em and these technologies will be exported to other countries are so they're wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard from the world coal association\nOr they're saying that because this report clearly targets colon says we're gonna have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely in what they're saying is actually no we need to create technologies that captured the emissions of cold and various blow the ground\nUm so that's one of the angles a that is being taken on the report\nI'm yeah I'm seeing here that the state department official as you're reporting that said that\nQuote governments do not formally indoor specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one percent during the same time so it's so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there well\nAnd it's it's not incorrect us Americans have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world's to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius\nAll right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\n[noise] high magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I guess more like a question flash comment on I think making and significant changes manageable for the average person is\nActually making change so high and it's like a cute kid playing like this and that um you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with that unfortunately it's not enough to make a dent on and\nOn the problems that we had in the environment and buy it you know is even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't send me from one day is that enough to make a change yeah\nWell breathe thank you I'm I'm I I didn't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to do she now a individual level efforts a professor she can do is breeze asking could they make a difference\nThey can and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems is just so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking at but what we looked at was people in primarily in the west\nWho eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines\nJust going back to what's best for them might so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge sacrifice we're asking people to do what they should do anyway for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land that deforestation that land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport but biking and walking more use of mass transit those are\nActive transport it's also good for your health you know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars\nUnless there is charging infrastructure and currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax on electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I ... that there are ways that we can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners\nOnly if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of product so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available\nLet's go to Kevin who's calling from ... Louisiana Kevin you're on the air\nHello Hi Kevin what's your thought\nIs that how you doing I just had a comment to make 'em you know I I work in the in all industry and um there's a lot of infrastructure that's already in place like in the Gulf of Mexico per se as\nTwo thousand platforms out there that has jazz jackets and the water might be a little less than that but at least a thousand where wind farms could be adapted to those jackets easily I mean but they are naturally infrastructure what happened to be built to you know the power generation would give it to the beach\nBut that that's something that that could be done also went on when an oil company those exploration on a certain area\nThey have to mitigate somewhere else it doesn't matter they dropped a drop all they're not if they have to clean the whole car they have to spend money to mitigate another area that needs mitigate needs\nRestoration mhm so it's it's a balance you know and they do spend money or in to the good I guess some people call it to the good of you know mining industry some people it's bad yeah but we use it we need it you know I just there's so much more common\n... Kevin thank you actually so much for your call cause many do you want to respond him in that first part of the Kevin indicating that I mean he's out there working in the Gulf Oil field saying that there is infrastructure in place if we wanted to to expand a wind generation\nWell there's actually a close relationship between offshore oil and also when you you you find a a ...\nThese are now going a very strong into the uh offshore wind industry and that sort of the deep\nOffshore wind industry which is where you need really really powerful infrastructure and where some of the most powerful women can be harnessed and if you can get at the shore than you can get yourself quite a lot of renewable energy I I think I think it goes to show that there is a corporate transition that's happening right now again the it's not at the pace\nOr that the one point five see report calls for right but there's all kinds of action happening it's just the question is can it somehow be be Marshall across the globe um when policies that are unified by all the governments and that's that's really what this report is asking", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "09"}
