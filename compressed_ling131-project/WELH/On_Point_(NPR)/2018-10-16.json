movements\nRight more fundamental them your builder to choose world leaders at a time when you're done\nWell our guest today Stephen Walt calls that policy a failure and he says listen to what then candidate Donald Trump said in the twenty sixteen election\nIn fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nStephen Walt says Donald Trump was right button don't be fooled Walt also says the Trump Administration may be headed down the exact same\nSo Stephen Walt is calling for a total overhaul of U.S foreign policy starting with what he sees as an unaccountable foreign policy elite this hour on point restraint realignment and realism facing America's foreign policy failures\nAnd you can join us Republican or Democrat it doesn't matter do you agree with the notion that the U.S has been driven by misguided mission to spread democracy abroad do you think it's time to refocus how and where we protect our power or do you fear that a more realistic U.S

welcome back to them point is to be here\nSo first of all a you\nDescribe where you you you you call what you see as a America's one of America's animating a foreign policy forces as a liberal had Gemini that's the kind of at the center of your book what do you mean by liberal Gemini\nWell it's a a shorthand term for the grand strategy of the United states has been following say since the end of the Cold War I'm it's liberal not in the sense of being left wing or right versus right wing but liberal in the sense that it seeks to promote\nThe classical liberal values of individual rights democracy free markets\nOr things like that and it's had Gemini or because it sees those things can only be spread around the world if they're done under American leadership at America's Best and through the active use of American power in some cases including the use of military power\nSo when you think about it this is a strategy that doesn't seek to preserve the status quo it actually wants to revise politics all over the world\nMake more countries like the United states do that peacefully if possible but if necessary using other means as well and that's basically been the objective of every American president since the end of the cold\nSupport for on point comes from college fine where consultants work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school

talking this hour with Stephen Walt he's a professor of international affairs at Harvard University and author of the new book the help of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy and you can join us where one eight hundred forty three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nOr let's listen to a little bit more about how multiple administrations over the past generation of talked about\nA U.S primacy of being a reason why\nThis country ought to spread democracy around the world this is first of all you're going to hear from secretary of State Madeleine Albright of course served under President Bill Clinton and she popularized the phrase indispensable nation to describe the United states here she is in Nineteen Ninety eight a during remark she gave a Tennessee State university\nWhat is needed above all as American leadership we are the only superpower and as a result of that we have many responsibilities and privileges and we stand tall and therefore we can see further into the future and I think that therefore we do have very special role\nThan in two thousand five at his second inaugural address President George W. Bush spelled out his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nSo it is a policy of the United states\nDo she can support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation\nAnd culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny and our world [noise]\nSo even walk to a\nDifferent people from two different parties here with us ... roughly the same idea but you call this policy failure right why\nWell there's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three were restricted everything was going to go swimmingly and the world we're in today are back in Nineteen Ninety three of the United states who's on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China\nA democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nOr the Oslo peace process is under way so we were thinking that maybe we're going to get you know peace in the middle east as well just ... ordinary optimism\nThere now fast forward to twenty eight team or the or relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believe\nPromoted is farther away than ever Iran had as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before fight signing the nuclear deal but they're essentially a a late nuclear power and I owe a India Pakistan and North Korea has tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat\nIn lots of different places of Freedom House are reported last year that it was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal is to end tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point um the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the costs we've seen in a variety of different places\nAnd without a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy of ... worldwide is it that it can be see that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places ah Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in Hungary backsliding in Poland a suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transformed the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact uh have clearly failed a you know had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS\nUm the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi live into a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better\nBy the way for all of this is going on then countries like Russia and China\nAnd Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nOne reaction is you seize Crimea to stop of Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable when in terms of his ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nSo one of the questions or that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U.S project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty that America had to the world being this guiding light for democracy ah but you said that there is an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nThat idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite\nTalking about a it's a a broad a group of set of people uh I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially who I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy the defense department intelligence services State Department so they are part of this of this for a whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that\nWriting comment on foreign issues on a pretty much daily basis then of course\nIssues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community as well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and often go to Washington to work so that's who I'm Talking about\nUm and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the ... the Gemini this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals\nAnd there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines in favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three\nUm you see that in the fact that people can circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotation soup and uh\nPlaying here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals\nBut as I Want to get to him in ... in a second about how you do you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but but Iraq is it the disaster of the Iraq War is isn't\nIt it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to just went dive into that a little bit\n'cause you know you said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but I wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security the United states I mean that's part of what you say here that the foreign policy elite as\nFrequently are collected issues of security in order to uh to get people on board with this idea of spreading democracy I mean isn't Iraq with a perfect example of that\nUm I I think it ... it shows you how easy it is to steer 'em a stir the debate and one of the points I make in the book is that\nThe foreign policy elite out especially presidents in the executive branch have all sorts of advantages in selling policies to the world\nUm and I point out that there's actually a pretty significant gap between what the American people actually say they want they want a more restrained foreign policy they don't want to engage in all these crusades around the world [noise]\nSo how do you convince them to go along\nOh you do the things that the Bush administration did but again it's not unique to the Bush administration you inflate threats\nYou pretend enemies or ten feet tall and have to be deal dealt with immediately you exaggerate the benefits so you know by doing Iraq by doing a Libya that lots of good things are going to come of all of this\n[noise] support for on

his new book is the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy\nA and professor of wealth lots of comments coming and let me just read a couple of them to you on Twitter poll mousse or us is saying questioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\nI says Noam Chomsky debunk this and wall should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion is the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera have been used as a stalking horse for American corporate had Gemini which is a highly questionable democratizing influence\nOr just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all the Walt\nI'm I'm sort of sympathetic to both comment I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very carefully heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states has favor to uh you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually don't benefit corporations at all go back to the\nUh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton in oil services corporation to do business with Iraq or to do business with Iran\nCheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning both of them\nAnd then that very same person ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars and us contracts\nThat's right yeah I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things things like that um but I Do think that motivation has been there a that has ... has driven certainly the\nGood part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in God's the and the desire to end now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger\nYeah but so I'm just a follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are just some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks and organizations who not not surprisingly than want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money [noise]\nAlright well lots of colors used to live at least get a couple of them in here Mitch is calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nHi thanks so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think are under under our current president um who is an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with a well\nI worry that are American values are going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh the uh journalists a highlight this\nConflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nMitch thank you for your call Steve\nI'm all well in some respects I think uh our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and wanted to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well but there are national security or others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to wind out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a Saudi journalist can show you are in Istanbul and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it\nPresident Trump has been lawfully it seems to me on this one uh that his initial statements were were quite forgiving he seems to be you know in typical Trump being fashion kicking up sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it\nUm [noise] it's I think you know the the concern the caller has is exactly right here and that I think one of the larger issues with President Trump is his inability to separate out some of his own personal interests and possibly personal financial interest from the broader interest of the country\nWell so let's talk more about the Trump Administration now because the you open your book saying that um then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of\nHis view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just just remind folks what what the president then candidate Trump said when he critiqued the status quo of U.S foreign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nAfter the cold or a foreign policy veered badly oh of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nLogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance what'd you ...\nDuring the other they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April two thousand sixteen now Stephen what we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions the president has made since then I mean about the Paris climate accord about or his a disc discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton talking about expanding the American mission in Syria\nBeyond the Syrian civil war and to containment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region a so here's national security visor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran or at a group called a United against nuclear on summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed the hell to pay\nThe John Bolton there are Stephen Walt not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is this is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour\nUm I think in the twenty sixteen campaign Trump who's not a sophisticated thinker on these things but he did into it or that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lot of people out of their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could out or tried to tell her foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is a ... ah since Trump became president all of his style his approach to the presidency and has\nA public style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive\nWhat strikes me most about it is how he has been pulled back in a lot of these same directions\nI'm certainly uh the fact that I having complained about nation building and we're not going to we're going to get out of the nation building business\nYou know he sent more troops to Afghanistan or as you recounted he's now seems to be willing to commit the United states to stay in Syria a much longer even though we don't really have an idea of what we're trying to accomplish potentially indefinitely sexually indefinitely I'm\nA he has bought a hook line and sinker the idea that Iran is some mortal threat to American interests throughout the middle east are and that of course\nHas led him to double down with Saudi Arabia doubled down with a Egypt a double town with Israel as well but notice that those are all of our traditional Middle East ally so he's not doing anything different there\nUm you'll recall he was very critical of NATO allies NATO countries had to start spending more they had actually started spending more even the Obama administration would of course he is now reaffirmed the American a commitment to NATO in a variety of ways as well\nAnd finally just as the Obama administration was pivot to Asia and getting more concerned about China the other central theme of the Trump Administration has been\nPre registration at your rocky hill dot org\n\nSome WVU are Boston and NPR I make her body this is on point secretary of state Mike Pompeo met with Saudi rulers\nPermitted to

before the break you said ... it's worth exploring further this question of a President Trump's relationship\nWith the house of salad and then perhaps we should even focus on Jared Kushner and his relationship with crown prince Mohammed or been some on I mean how would you describe how close they are\n[noise] well you you probably know that the first overseas trip that President Trump took was to Riyadh yes where he was fed it in and received you know as a great kind of international statesman and he you know seem to appreciate that\nI'm a lot um and then a special relationship developed with the president's son in law Jared Kushner and to deal with a whole series of topics one was uh the fight against ISIS and the ... campaign at the other was the Israeli Palestinian peace process\nAnd lastly was of the uh relationship the business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis were out and still are reforming diversifying their economy they want us to invest in the United states they want to buy a lot of things from the U.S and build strong connections with us institutions\nBanks universities et cetera so that relationship is uh is is a very personal and tight one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the uh attention an anger that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with\nThe feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump's\nOkay well Steven Cook though the ... the president has said that he he would vow quotes severe punishment right if\nIf a Saudi or influence or south of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ... uh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a\nThat punishment to effect arms sales for example I'm a ... at least ten billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what position does is put the president in\n... president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think his statements\nHave ah been an effort to\nProvide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story I think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and who's inclination is\nActually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia a uninterrupted I think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis was or something where the White House was acknowledging a the pressure and a two weeks for commentary about\nThe disappearance of democracy will treat 'em but uh overall\nI'm not made human rights or a priority and hum has looked upon ah Washington's relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned a hundred and ... ... a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal uh which actually was not struck by the Trump Administration but was actually agree to under the Obama administration but signed after President Trump a came into\nOffice yeah and I appreciate the correction that I had said ten billion but you're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal but but it's not point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements this long standing relationship between these two countries in the house sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nDoes that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed\nMultiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other\nWell that has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now\nA given the fact that the Trump Administration regards Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region in Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer the United states is\nUm but still many of a Washington is most important allies are trading partners do rely upon a oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that the United states is interested in in a global a capitalist water or the fact that the Chinese the Koreans the Japanese the Indians\nAre are all depended upon oil coming out of this region and significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia\nThe United states has a a compelling interest\nA in a radio stability in supporting Saudi Arabia security well I think\nSo I just want to get hurt it's okay I just wanna get Bernard Haykel you in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between ... between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nI I think it is impossible and I've described the relationship as a structural relationship not a transactional want even though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia you know started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War in the fight against communism their instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible and global market which means that if any disruption happens of Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately\nThey are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American or an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have a ...\nFickle Islamists the Saudis are instrumental again and fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAnd a mom and been some on M. B. S. because he has made it a policy of the kingdom to turn away from a Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if he if he succeeds in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or NBS\nI Want to play a clip here uh on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other uh leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage and hedge point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitments of human rights\nSteven Cook what does the United states stands to lose perhaps\nMorally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing close relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\nThe listeners on line who's who's talking to us about what about uh you know remembering the the terrorists that came from Saudi Arabia after nine eleven and again in Yemen comes up over and over again there's a U.S a hundred year famine that Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe\nA ... in the world right now largely driven by Saudi bombing there and it does not the United states stand to lose something by\nI don't want to call it an unquestioning relationship but they're so close it's close in tight relationship\nWell this is the central dilemma for American policymakers who want to ah to secure America's security interests around the region\nUh who wants to fight the Islamic state and wants to counter Iranian influence\nUm it has allies in the region who will do things that are run counter to American values and oftentimes with American ...

I mean I personally I think Trump could care less about the show again that interview on the White House lawn yesterday was you know another act it's another lie I mean I Am hoping\nThat Congress ... you know get some intestinal fortitude hair and can can do something yeah I'm In that show the global dictators that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump a gift and Donald Trump but that the U.S Congress\nIs going to start taking some action against\nHuman rights violations that are occurring around the globe\nCalling to rank an alarm bell on the on over reaction to the hum Ho Chi situation\nI'm In terms of bending to the political domestic political forces have international Middle Eastern countries themselves the greatest violators of human rights who are trying to exploit this situation in order to affect American foreign policy\nI remind us all a similar situation we were in in Nineteen Seventy six or emerging new American president Jimmy Carter may human rights they central piece of his foreign policy pricing pressure on the bench already on\nA on human rights record\nWith all the displacement and the conversion of the coast in American ally that Iran then certainly just American Fall and a significant deterioration of human rights or in Iran result taking over a million Iranians get seven million in exile I'm Seventy million living under tyranny\nIs what happens when when one American foreign policy um treats human rights as if they saw and point I'm does not understand the strategic dimensions that are involved in that in in our relations\nSaid thank you for your call or Bernard Haykel what is how do you respond to said\nWell I I think he makes a good point and the and and the story that he tells about Iran is a is is certainly true\nUm I I think that ah you know the point that he's trying to make as far as Saudi Arabia is concern is that there is a very important strategic relationship here\nUm that the that the states that are engaged in let's say the Turks are with their campaign of of uh of leaks ah\nSome of which may be disinformation we don't know whether they're true or not the Turks are allies with the Qataris who hate the Saudis the Turks and the Saudis are rivals um the Iranians are rivals to the Saudis so one has to be really careful\nOr in coming to a conclusions about what to do as a result of of this tragic a episode I think that the most important thing is to focus on is a crime was committed to get people punished for the crime\nBut not to jeopardize the relationship that we have that the United states has with its strategic allies in the region because the repercussions of let's say undermining Saudi Arabia and causing a the\nWeakening of the regime there could be a civil war and let's not forget that in the middle east we have four or five failed states with lots of war is raging and a similar one uh you know God Forbid in Saudi Arabia would lead us to a military intervention possibly in in this region and that's not something we want to get involved at all\nThis is the public radio\n\nMajor funding for on green is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for

an extra ... on point radio dot org or not no deal before the break we were talking about that really hard hit that you took on the tire test in in twenty twelve or in Kansas\nAnd I want to play a little bit of sound of releasing this very significant race it happened not long after that at Talladega this is kind of the book into the big hits that you took\nThat scared me straight as you were saying uh a little bit earlier so first of all let's listen to what happened in the last lap of the good Sam roadside assistance four hundred at the Talladega super speedway\nIn Alabama I'm there was a huge pack of cars there are in that last lap and here's what happened\nAre basically for deep they're going at two hundred miles an hour or if you haven't seen it or you don't remember it it's on YouTube and it is breathtaking to watch now here's Dale Earnhardt junior over the radio conversation with his crew chief Steve tart right after just moments after that Talladega crash\n[noise] how how many of them if I can say\nWell so they'll tell us about that moment because I think it was after that are and how you felt after that that's what took you to go get help yeah so this was four weeks\nAfter the Kansas crash that had been so so terrible for me\nAnd I had been suffering with the symptoms for those four weeks and I finally started to feel like my old self again coming into Talladega that weekend so there was a big big sense of relief from me but there was also\nA sense of fear because at Talladega they have these big PACs cars and when there are those type of crashes as they're they're impossible to skate so I knew the chances of me being involved in another accident we were very high for that particular weekend\nSo I was very nervous about that I'll I wanted was just to be able to get through that race clean with no problems and I felt like I'd be home free and um get I got involved in that crash in ... and during a crash cart tee ball on the side of the car and spot in the car around and I immediately\nWent all the way back to having the symptoms that I had before and maybe even worse and so\nBut this is a different kind of injury the right because you were like whipped around yeah so the ... this was instead of a an impact you know direct impact this was a very quick fast spin\nAnd so I knew immediately something was wrong with me again and I was really angry about it a and very emotional unusually emotional for some reason and you can hear that in the in the radio\nCommunication and uh that's something not typically probably wouldn't be having I wouldn't be really having that personal of a conversation over that radio because it's something that the entire team in the all the fans can here and have access to\n'em but in those moments when you're injured and you're not really in control your emotions and ... and all those things and so um\n[noise] I ... I knew that through my through reading about concussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you\nUh retired players they're just so much content out there so many stories and I can't [noise]\nUm I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about lowering layering concussions together and having concussions very close together in a very short period of time and\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something\nUm changed about you and something you couldn't correct well\nCan I just I've been here for ... ... you really you write about in the book about how right after that that crashed that did that second hit a Talladega ... if you were saying like you were ... more emotional less less restrained I mean\nNASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track a two hundred miles an hour\nBut ah you see in the book that\nYou drove your car back to the garage and ESPN had a TV camera there waiting on me big pack of reporters wanting to ask you about the crash he started talking in your eyes get why any volume picks up in your face turning\nRed and here's what you said\nI Can't believe that everybody is no\n... nobody simple enough to\nRealize just how ridiculous that was the man was hey is ridiculous if that's what we did every week I wouldn't be doing it I'll just put it so you like that [noise]\nHis alley rice every week I'd find a job it's bloodthirsty if that's the way they belong in fact some of the loan Lance ridiculous I don't even want to go day tell her ... next year but I have much choice [noise] it's really not rice and I don't know it's just as it's all disappointing how that all went down for like\nA lot of money right there is just a lot of wasted I mean if if\nThis race and that's how we're going to continue to rise and nothing's going to change a NASCAR car's plays a lot of money\nDale Earnhardt junior how out of character was that for you\nI think it's pretty asked out of character you be that\nUm to be that aggressive I think was out of character for me and I could feel a ... motions I'm In that moment you know sort of not knock it feel myself not being able to shut up you know not being able to buy my lip and and and keep those\nOpinions to myself because they were going to do mean no good bye\nI'm sharing them and that in that environment and I did get some pushback from NASCAR about those comments to particularly the bloodthirsty comment and\nUm they weren't very happy with me and I know better than that you know I Know NASCAR well enough and and my intentions as in my career had been to try to lift the sport up and be a great representative for the sport and then that moment I was not doing that and I couldn't control it\nThat was the worst part about it in and um I could not control my emotions in and with that injury having just occurred and I dealt with that for the next you know forty eight hours a day trying to\nCalm down trying to make sense of what I was feeling I'm trying to figure out what I was going to do about it um and luckily I got pointed in the right direction to see\nA specialist in their surgeon to a that was local and Charlotte a doctor Betty yeah and so that man got that right there was the saving grace for me because I don't know whether I Would have made the right decisions going forward to take care of myself had I not been put\nIn front of the right people yeah so we got a lot of college when I talk to you and I want to get to the right just a second here but but but let me ask you mean the way you write about are the kind of hits you took we were talking about two big ones there but but also there's a lot of 'em and I'm\nPutting smaller includes here has a NASCAR nothing's really small but you know 'cause everything's going so fast I just wonder like how many of your fellow drivers have had concussions how often do you think drivers are behind the wheel\nOr you know in these races with their uh you know not at a hundred percent because of the effects of of getting hit in the head all the time\nI think it's very rare I actually do um I feel like that that crashed in two thousand twelve was an anomaly for me I\nFeel like that it was a um you know just a unique style of accident and impact that not a lot of drivers will experience in their career um for the for you know\nFor the majority of my career I never you know I never was having problems with a crash\nBecause we aren't just public radio we are the public's radio\n\nSupport for on point comes from exact

I think one thing that surprised me about what they're really in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very very specific specific regimen of exercises and other protocol essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that\nPerhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when a brain is healing from from concussions\nI that's a common a perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment we've actually identified now that there are six different types of concussions and there's some types of concussions were quote unquote rest or at least regular\n\nMajor funding from point is provided by Geico offering auto insurance

to on point\nHello constructive\nUh so first of all tell us what do we know about what the latest is in terms of what's happening in Istanbul at uh the Saudi consulate there we're seeing that a Turkish officials have been allowed inside the consulate what is what's happened since then\nThere is a report from the Associated Press but I haven't been able to confirm independently that prosecutors are saying they found some evidence that ... was killed and saw the conflict that murder took place there\nAre that's becoming less and less controversial as the Saudi Arabian authorities have shifted their story I see oh they are no they no longer appear to be denying that anything happened to your mouth or sugar while he was in the conflict now they're shifting to\nHe was killed there but it was a a a kind of rendition gone wrong Jared ... rendition what horribly awry Mm um and so that's that seems to be fair to play\nOkay so I'm seeing here the Associated Press report that you're referring to again this is from the a P uh that high level Turkish officials say police have found quote certain evidence during the surge of the Saudi constantly in Istanbul\nA David step back here with us for a second and and just walk us through\nTurkey's role in all this I mean obviously this incident took place in in Turkey in in Istanbul a and a ... or early reports on what may have happened to ... G came from a Turkish media ... officials but but what role does turkey play here and how important are they to to this case\nYeah that's the big question so all that we know really about the details of what happened to drop shrug it has come from unnamed Turkish officials speaking to journalists including myself\nRobotic assisted joint replacements more at Arthur ...\nSupport for on point comes from Carver night offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses including automatic back up for a server than computers higher veil ability and disaster recovery solutions\nAnd automated data migration learn more in carbon I dot com and posters Smith printing posters on wrinkle resistant fold the fabric that transports flat for conference presentations\nPoster Smith provides a service to research communities worldwide learned more poster Smith dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making ... we're talking about renewed scrutiny on us Saudi relations following the disappearance and reported\nKilling of journalists and dissident Jamal ... showed gee I'm joined today by Steven Cook he's a senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations and also joined today by Bernard Haykel professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University\nA and a professor heckle ... before the break you said ... it's worth exploring further this question of a President Trump's relationship\nWith the house of salad and then perhaps we should even focused on Jared Kushner and his relationship with crown prince Mohammed or been some on I mean how would you describe how close they are\n[noise] well you you probably know that the first overseas trip that President Trump took was to Riyadh yes where he was fed it in and received you know as a great kind of international statesmen and he you know seem to appreciate that\nI'm a lot um and then a special relationship developed with um the president's son in law Jared Kushner and to deal with a whole series of topics one was uh the fight against ISIS and the ... campaign or the other was the Israeli Palestinian peace process\nAnd lost the was that'd be a relationship to business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis were out and still are reforming a diverse\nThey want to buy a lot of things from the U. S. and build strong connections with us institutions\nBanks universities et cetera so that relationship is uh is is a very personal and tight one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the ah attention an anger that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with\nUm the feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump's\nOkay well Steven Cook though the ... the president has said that he he would vow quote severe punishment right if\nIf a Saudi an influence or us out of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ... uh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a\nThat punishment to affect arms sales for example I'm a bit at least ten billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what position does is put the president in\n... president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think his statements\nHave ah been an effort to\nProvide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story I think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and he's inclination is\nActually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia or uninterrupted I think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis\nWas or something where the White House was acknowledging or the pressure and a two weeks for commentary about the disappearance of democracy spoke to\n'em but uh overall uh this is a president who has not made human rights or a priority and hum has looked upon ah Washington's relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned or a hundred and ... ... a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal uh which actually was not struck by the Trump Administration boat was actually agree to under the Obama administration but signed after President Trump a came into office yeah\nAnd I appreciate the correction that I had said ten billion but you're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal but it's that point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements this long standing relationship between these two countries I mean how essential of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nDoes that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed\nMultiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other\nWell that has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now\nAre given the fact that the Trump Administration regards Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region in Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of ah of\nUm but still many of a Washington is most important allies are trading partners do rely upon a oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that the United states is interested in in a global capitalist water or the fact that the Chinese the Koreans the Japanese the Indians\nAre are all depended upon oil coming out of this region in significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia\nThe United states has a a compelling interest ah in how to reduce the building and supporting Saudi Arabia security well I think\nSo I just want to get hurt it's okay I just want to get Bernard Haykel view in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between ... between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm I I think it is impossible and I've described the relationship as a structural relationship not a transactional one even though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia you know started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War and the fight against communism their instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible and global market which means that if any disruption happens in Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately\nThey are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American\nOr an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have Islam you have to fight against uh the the radical Islamists the Saudis are instrumental again and fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAt a moment when someone NBS because he has made it\nA policy of the kingdom to turn away from a Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if he if he succeeds in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right also there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or NBS\nI Want to play a clip here uh on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other uh leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage and hedge point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitment to human rights\nSteven Cook what does the United states stands to lose perhaps\nMorally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing close relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\nThe listeners on line who who talking to us about what about uh you know remembering the the terrorists that came from Saudi Arabia after nine eleven and again Yemen comes up over and over again there's a U.S a hundred year famine that Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe\nOr in the world right now largely driven by Saudi bombing there and I mean it does not the United states stand to lose something by\nI don't want to call it an unquestioning relationship but the silk clue and close in tight relationship\nWell this is the central dilemma for American policymakers who want a to secure America's security interests around the region\nOr who want to fight the Islamic state and want to counter Iranian influence um it has allies in the region who will do things that are run counter to American values and oftentimes with American ... either ...

I mean I personally I think Trump could care less about the show in that interview on the White House lawn yes say was you know another act it's another lie I mean I Am hoping\nThat Congress and I'll get some intestinal fortitude hair and can can do something yeah um and that show the global dictators that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump gift and Donald Trump but that the U.S Congress\nIs going to start taking some action against\nThe human rights violations that are occurring around the globe will\nDoors thank you for your call Steven Cook let me turn turn that to you a first of all do it to ... assertion that the president's own rhetoric against journalists may have emboldened ah folks like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\n[noise] yeah and this is something that has been part of the commentary since uh the first reported missing of jumped choked gee I'm In I think that certainly\nIt's unfortunate that the president refers to press as the enemy of the people ah it certainly underscores for dictators around the world that the the White House will will downplay attacks on the media but let's also be clear\n'em and people like vitamin Bruton Turkish president rigid type or one uh others around with the Chinese um are are arresting journalists harming journalists\nSo one can imagine that uh if this decision was made at the highest ah levels in Saudi Arabia they looked around the world and they saw how the Russians are killing people in small British towns\nOr in Dupont Circle Washington DC Dupont Circle who tells the Chinese are rounding up people turkey is the leading jailer of journalists in the world none of those countries have paid a price for that\nAnd that ah the\nSaudis must to believe that they wouldn't pay a price either so I think yes in part it does have to do with a President Trump's rhetoric but I also think it is in the international environment that transcends a that transcends President Trump\nOkay so I'm going to explore that a little more in the second specifically regarding some of the things that ... G himself had has set about a\nA crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but but Steven Cook there was a point that you mentioned a much early in the program that should have dug deeper in into and that is um how much does the president's personal business interest in Saudi Arabia first of all what are they specifically and how much do you think\nThat is influencing or his approach to this current diplomatic crisis\nWell there's all kinds of allegations concerning the president and his family's business ties with Gulf monarchies I'm I'm not aware that there's a Trump International hotel in Riyadh [noise] um\nInstead of links between the Trump organizations in countries all over the world and this is a a continuing question whether ah the president is making decisions based on his ah family is a personal financial interests or on behalf of the United states\nUm we do know that um the the government of Qatar through a an investment fund\nHas invested in a building in New York City that was in tremendous debt that's owned by the Christian or companies\nCut their in Saudi Arabia are at odds so um there's a lot of different uh business interests\nAnd it's very very hard to pinpoint specifically\nAbout how the president is making decision on on these issues I think any president in United States would be in a tremendously awkward position with allegations coming from a a a NATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had murdered someone and they're constantly in in in Turkey is you know main city\nOr how the president would respond to that anybody occupying the oval office would be trying to weigh the ... how much to emphasize a values and freedom of the press and protections for the press versus a relationship with a country like Saudi Arabia\nWell and look the Saudis spend a lot of money in Washington right the Washington Post is reporting that Saudi Arabia plowed twenty seven million dollars into lobbying in Washington Jeff last year making it one of the highest spending country seeking to influence U.S policy that's according to\nPublic records uh well let's take another call here said is calling from Green Bay Wisconsin said you're on the air\nUh hello I Am calling to rent an alarm bell on the on over reaction to the uh hush achieve situation\nI'm In terms of bending to the political domestic political forces have international Middle Eastern countries themselves the greatest violators of human rights who are trying to exploit this situation in order to affect American foreign policy\nI remind us of a similar situation we were in Nineteen Seventy six or the merger who American president Jimmy Carter may human rights they\nCentral piece off his foreign policy placing pressure on the bench already on a on human rights record resulting displacement and the conversion to the coast American ally at the ... then to the greatest American full\nAnd a significant deterioration of human rights or in Iran resulting in over a million Iranians get ... million in exile\nAnd Seventy million living under tyranny is what happens when when I was American foreign policy um treats human rights as if they saw and point and does not understand the strategic dimensions that are involved in that in in our relations\nSaid thank you for your call a Bernard Haykel what is how do you respond to said\nWell I I think he makes a good point and the and and the story that he tells about Iran is a it's it's certainly true um I I think that ah you know the the point that he's trying to make as far as Saudi Arabia is concern is that you know there is a\nVery important strategic relationship here\nUm that the that the states that are engaged in let's say the Turks are with their campaign of of uh of leaks ah some of which may be disinformation we don't know whether they're true or not the Turks are allies with the Qataris who hate the Saudis the Turks and the Saudis are rivals\nUm the Iranians are rivals to the Saudis so one has to be really careful uh in\nComing to a conclusions about what to do as a result of of this tragic episode I think that the most important things to focus on is a crime was committed to get people punished\nFor dies the relationship that we have that the United states has with its strategic allies in the region because the repercussions of let's say undermining Saudi Arabia and causing\nA the weakening of the regime there could be a civil war and let's not forget that in the middle east we have four or five failed states with lots of war is raging and a similar one or you know God Forbid in Saudi Arabia would lead us to a military intervention possibly in in this region and that's not something we want to get involved", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "16"}
