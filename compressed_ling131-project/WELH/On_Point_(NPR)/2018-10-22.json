community is saying right now are about\nHow concerned are they\n[noise] they're concerned a to a certain degree um if you're if you're breaking it down by influence operations versus the infrastructure they've seen less of the attacks on the infrastructure\nThan the foreign influence of times and that's what they warned about on friday mainly was that there was this attempt by ... and they identified multiple countries uh Russia China Iran as being interested in influencing the vote via social media and other kinds of information or other kinds of campaigns like that\nAs far as what the actual threat is to the election infrastructure I'm Chris crabs who's the top person at the H s a on on cyber security at the national protection and program director at\nA worn on on last week that he is paranoid that he hasn't seen those kind of election for attacks that they might have expected to see based on what they saw and twenty sixteen\nRight you quote him in one of your stories of saying I don't want to have another failure of intelligence and I don't want to most importantly have another failure of imagination\nExactly and so one of the things they're they're talking about now is okay if you look at last time there was a by by the summer that we've already seen the spear phishing attacks we've already seen some of the information looking out about the about the DNC\nWe're now in a couple of ... and we haven't seen that so what he's well he said he's most worried about right now is the things that that are the short term things that they haven't seen before trying to ... those those attacks that we haven't had yet\nWe have seen some kinds of things like this and other countries from say Russia where they will drop some some information that

them apparently of a theme he's from Facebook and Twitter are Andrew Cash a can Eliot\nAnd let's see who else Hello Kitty zero five eight zero all basically say really question mark an hour on election security and foreign meddling when we have citizens in our own country meddling in America's right to vote\nSee Georgia's governor race well too old listeners and commenters on line who are making this point about voter purging I'm here domestically I Would like to you to know that on October twelve my colleague David Folkenflik had an entire hour about voter suppression\nA and purging that we hosted the he hosted here at on point so good on point radio dot org\nTake a listen to that our there it was terrific it as an issue we have talked about and will continue to do so in the future but this hour we thought it was actually important to also\nTake a look at election security and voting security at the state and local level and you know in our defense I'm going to say we're not the only ones who were worried about this because here is a clip of Senator Marco Rubio at a Senate intelligence committee back in March\nLaying out what he thinks could be a hypothetical hacking he'd give me an example of how it can be done on local election systems\nThey penetrate the voter database of local election officials in strategic relocated counties or states\nAnd then they use analytic information they may have gotten from who knows where and they use that information to go into the database and they changed the addresses of individuals there by their precincts move around maybe they even delete some people from the rolls\nAnd the result is that on election day we started getting reports about thousands of voters in different parts of the country who can't vote because when they show up\nThey're not registered they're not in the system or they show up and they're told that they're voting places halfway across town somewhere else\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio there in San ... says Senate intelligence committee in March Tim stark let me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on um lots of specific examples\nOf challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me that story briefly of the election systems and software machine\nA model six fifty tabulate machine and I should note that election systems in software is one of the country's largest vendors voting equipment um what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate him machine\nI've actually brought up a little bit already but I'll I'll elaborate because there are some other details about yeah interesting want it so it's a bow tie building machine that could be used at the ... at a county level to or if it were ... rock and somebody could it could alter hundreds and hundreds of votes perhaps thousands that's\nWith a with a with a writing pen and third um ... it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security a lot of the voting miners have taken a lot of criticism yes and that's just one of them\nFor kind of sticking their head and the fans on this I'm not realizing that this is a problem and wanting to kind of go away\nUm other other machines have had other problems um you know strange things like researchers finding a Chinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is the ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing them who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even realize a Chinese music playlist yes\nIt was it was like MP threes if you remember it was a it was a it was an older machine that they that that they found this on it also found some examples of people um I I it's sending out or or being are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tampered with and that way although they had no conclusive evidence and so we have never what\nHave we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on any machines are no because we haven't done those forensic artist that you're talking about I\nI think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now we're being told us but but keep in mind of course that now are spent on basically everything they say yeah there's a strong chance that it's that it's happened and I'm just not aware of it and that but few people are well\nEric Rosen buck at Kim points out that\nSome states use these this particular machine the model six fifty to process ballots for entire counties and you can imagine in closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Bronner University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found even when they identify flies is that they don't get fixed\nSo is that a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] there's a really important points to begin with this is not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty four team the Russian intelligence services attacked the boat tabulation machines in Ukraine decided sort of tries to process that election you could see them easily using that same playbook in the U.S\nOn the question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clothes and proprietary\nBased on their bottom line interests of trying to make money\nAnd were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security to find vulnerabilities um someone big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSomebody here because the the the level to which some of these uh these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as ... as reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference that er ES and asked election systems and soft or actually I Believe sent\nA letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary of copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nIt's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether I don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced explanation it reminds me a little bit of back in the older days when\nThings aren't aware that didn't allow new technology to emerge um so I think there's a problem are now the states or in a position where they're unfortunately are under resourced and so don't always have a lot of money to up to the systems or keep their security opted into pattern\nSo there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this was more on the ... not being as transparent as they should\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania deputy deputy secretary for elections and administration posts she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to on point Oh thank you\nUp first of all let's just let's get your take on this um E. S. S. example again election an election systems of software this major vendor of voting machines and in this country because they have issued a statement saying that this report about the hack ability of their machines\nUm ... their statement says that the vote the report can validate that any type of technology can be exploited under conditions where it is made accessible with zero controls which is not the case in an election\nRegarding the M six fifty E. S. N. F. first manufactured it um in Nineteen Ninety nine and discontinued manufacture those units in early two thousand eight so major vendor they're saying there isn't a problem ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all that I just want to point out the ... six fifty is is a high speed central count scanner\nThat is not used at polling places but I I think that I Will agree with their premise that all the computers are vulnerable and that Ninety nine percent of our votes in the United states are counted by computers and so those computers need special handling\nAnd in order to manage the risk that counting votes by computers present\nAnd so we can never get the risk down to zero\nWhich is why we need to give election officials the tools they need to demonstrate that the software reported the results accurately and that's why we were talking earlier about paper ballots an audits ... specifically if you look at the six fifty that's a that's an optical scanner so that's a paper ballot\n\n[noise] support her on point comes from college find where consultants work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more in college ... dot com\nAnd exact science is offering cola guard for average risk and also versus being a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be used at home by prescription only information that coal to guard test dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making ... we're talking about election integrity at the state and local level about how to be sure the vote you actually cast the ballot you cast is as secure\nAs possible and I'm speaking this hour has Tim's Stark's he covers cyber security for political ... Rosen Bach also joined us he's co director of Harvard spell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project Mary Schneider is with us as well she's president of verified voting a national ... election integrity\nAdvocacy group and let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Condos that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that indeed who you are\nThat is indeed who I Am\nWell Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in uh how is it the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we said we feel that will shape we uh we actually started working on cyber security in our electrical systems back to two thousand Thirteen\nOr ... at that time we did it all all risk and ball ability assess but um we had any recommendations or a potent you give them a low priority or an animal we've consistently work to get all those recommendations or but\nHaving said that we also do a better place in the past and we continue to do a a regular ... other patients tests as well uh and I think that the important thing to remember or most of for most of your listeners is that\nUh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very this essential I modeled on like most New England we do not have county government level ...\nIs a state level or in\nAnd you know we've got a lot of things going on and I you know I sat on a panel Eric Wilson bomb a it back in March or the or the Senate intelligence committee\nA you know we are now so at that time that we're implementing Jason yeah legal Web Web applications are walls for the\nWill secretary since you're kind of somebody just jump in here your cell phone dogs also shaky here but at this so there's a key question when I ask you before hopefully your last hopefully like whoa fall apart but\nI'm seeing here that even given the steps that you you said you've just taken there in Vermont to ensure the security of the voting system there as much as possible I mean NBC News is real reports that in August\nUsed to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups tried to get access\nTo your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did in Libya but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the oil that has a website or anything that isn't getting ... and every day what we experience was scans are a lot\nA lot a lot of the systems showed us where they were coming originating from ... you can always count on that but when they raised our attention if you want to call it um was the one that said Russian Federation we voted out onto\nA department of homeland security through the communication hold a call the ... of a developed over the last a year\nAnd a I think that the you know our systems are getting and thousands of times per day thousands of times per hour the question is how to cook the systems in place to defend against it\nBack in two thousand sits in there were Twenty one state that were targeted yep one state will reach\nAn uncle's the conversation was always about that one state that was released would never adopt a twenty that are actually a defended again\nWe was reached you know I I haven't I haven't heard of that which state which was breached subject Honda is\nA ... I Believe it was a leader was a um Illinois\nOkay interesting well one last question for you briefly because I wanted her back to I guess with uh with what you have to say but but I mean you're the secretary of state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in election security\nWell now let me let me speak for myself and I must say it's a ... ... is that there are some practices that we need to put it all used one of them in Boulder marked the balance\nIs that was really the only way that you actually audit oh we do what we call we do a high school confidence level articulates a randomly selected\nOf towns after thirty days election um we've been doing them ... thousands rubber on a discrepancy\nYeah well a gym condos the secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call\nYou're welcome\nMary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what the secretary of state of Vermont had to say well\nI think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that I said earlier in the show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis of machines or\nAnything like that there is a statistical sample of these ballots of the voter my paper ballots that you can check and make sure the software\nI'm ... was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing risking vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor to do the same thing\nAnd I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes the elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes around in a very small secretary of State Department says the level of resources has got it\nResource question well let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHi Meg now\nI Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machines we switch to voter my ballot\nCombined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning we have locked suitcases for each district we have a [noise]\nStickers that keep the voting machine from being messed with unless somebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by a board of elections on those uh audits shape how many ballots say have centralized become shrink wrapped in\nA package is a fifth day we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots for people that aren't showing up in our um\nOur in our elections books so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the affidavit ballot\nAnd have a chance to vote when the voter gets done marking the ballot they have little circles in them for each candidate and amend that yeah they take the paper ballot they get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through at the end of the night\nWe have people who\nBreak down the voting machine they a scanner and we have to memory cards inside of the scanner\nOne of the memory cards were able to pop out and we physically hand to a runner\nWho physically takes it down to the board of elections too so that they can do a quick audits not official unofficial southern get it I think both ... and then um there's also a second memory chip in the same machine\nYeah will come down with a ... I'm going to take the call back from you on that point and thank you so much because you feel a lot of interesting things that I Want to hear from our guests reflects on so Kathleen election inspector from Syracuse New York Thank you for your call ... book\nUm I think there were probably several other steps that tells me more to talk to us about about how New York tries to make their elections as secure as possible does it sound like they're doing living the rising\nIt sounds like they're doing really good jobs are cup wins one of those state and local election officials are really earned or respect when we have this national level tabletop exercise here in Cambridge, Massachusetts several months ago and you'd see she's thinking about a very systematically about how to mitigate risk at all of these different steps which\nFunding for on point is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance through the Geico insurance agency additional information can be found at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven out of\nIt out while from\nW.

I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with um the fact that a lot of young people\nThey gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show\nWill have way more a social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind so that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this Earth I'm a ... it has very little to do with\nOur show because our show I Believe we ... our show is the most diverse ... a a cast in television we have we cast everybody in fact I think uh uh this past season without giving anything away well\nYeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little T who gives a who we have on\nThe show um uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much [laughter] you have your token white folks with uh we found some don't but listen you\nKnow we we cash the show based on the criteria is what is charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast of the show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking you this question but I just have to know a [laughter]\n'cause I'm a huge ... fan and and and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that that that you you dropped her from the showing that in that great lip sync between her into the metallic\nAnd I I just don't think she was just what happened there well\nWe we um first of all you need and so Rob because ... is almost steals the ... the movie stars born she's in that movie and she does a great job in that but the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner\nOr even as you played the the the clip of misfit Angie she did one episode and became an end to the ashes all star so futile um nobody loses if if you're on the show your winter\nOkay so that actually leads me to something else that I wanted to ask you about because\nThere's been a lot of media coverage of recalls drag race because it has become so popular has really uh elevated the careers of the drag queen to appear on the show to super starting level as you said but I think it was in a big New York times article a while ago\nThat talked you know is there a risk in the drank community a little bit between um the clean to get to be on on your show versus the many many many who don't because you know I've been reading that\nAh you know people in booking shows now folks are looking for a recall girls essentially who've been on the show and perhaps not booking very hardworking drag queens who who just haven't been on TV [noise]\nI I've been doing this for a long time um I've been in fashion I've been out fashion I'll be I'm In now I'll be out again that's the nature of the business and you have to keep your your brand alive and whether you're on TV or not you have to make\n\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are ... and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance at Geico dot com or one eight hundred mine for seven on him [noise]\nFrom WVU are Boston and NPR I'd make her body this is on point if you were a malicious hacker looking for a choice target you couldn't find a better one then America's elections in them\nThree thousand county government administer elections using some three hundred and fifty thousand voting machines and twenty six the Russian hackers attacked election management system in thirty nine states\nThat no one is saying Moscow changed actual votes a purge voters off the rules but cybersecurity experts are saying that official haven't done enough to stop foreign agents from trying I'm next some point\nWhat it will really take to secure elections at the place you cast your ballot\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere\nPresident Trump says the U.S intends to begin cutting or reducing aid to three Central American countries for failing to stop thousands of migrants were heading towards the U.S speaking out of a trip to taxes this is a port Senate Republican Ted Cruz Trump said those countries have received millions usa dollars over the past fiscal year\nEl Salvador that made a lot\nEvery year we give a bar and they did not say\nGive them the money you know what it is covered all the time the dollars they like a lot of us\nFocus is with thousands of migrants not traveling through Mexico trying to reach the west Trump says he's alerted both the border patrol and the military as he looks to make the migrants are mid term election issue [noise]\nUS military in Afghanistan has acknowledging that an American general was wounded during a deadly attack in the southern city of Kandahar last week initially the command described and only as an American service member ...

attempts to access voter registration data bases those attempts have been thwarted but in twenty sixteen Russians did attack election management systems in some thirty nine states\nAnd that system is

that newsletter at our website ... radio dot org Tim's Stark's welcome to the program hey glad to be here\nSo first of all just give us an overlay of what the intelligence community is saying right now are about foreign interference attempts or in the mid term elections how concerned are they\n[noise] they're concerned or to a certain degree um if you're if you're breaking it down by influence operations versus the infrastructure they've seen less of the attacks on the infrastructure\nThan the foreign influence at times and that's what they warned about on friday mainly was that there was this attempt by and there are multiple countries or Russia or China or Iran as being interested in influencing the vote via social media and other kinds of information or other kinds of campaigns like that\nAs far as what the actual threat is to the election infrastructure I'm Chris crops who's the top person at the age of ... ah on on cyber security at the national protection program director at\nA worn on on last week that he was paranoid but he hasn't seen those kind of an election for sure attacks that they might have expected to see based on what they saw and twenty sixteen\nRight you quote him in one of your stories as saying I don't want to have another failure of intelligence and I don't want to most importantly have another failure of imagination\nExactly and so one of the things that are they're talking about now is okay if you look at last time there was a by by the summer that we've already seen the spear phishing attacks we've already seen some of the information looking out about the about the DNC\nWe're now in a couple of ... and we haven't seen that so when he's what he said he's most worried about right now is the things that that are the short term things that they haven't seen before trying to ... those those attacks that we haven't had yet\nWe have seen some kinds of things like this and other countries from say Russia where they will drop some some information that they've hacked or learned about at the very last minute so that's a but certainly a theoretical possibility\nSo just to remind us in twenty sixteen the uh uh activity that we did see

Senate intelligence committee in March Tim stark let me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on lots of specific examples\nOf challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me the story briefly of the election systems and software machine\nOr the model six fifty populating machine and I should note that election systems in software is one of the country's largest vendors of voting equipment um what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate machine\nI've actually brought that up a little bit already but I'll elaborate because there are some other details about yeah interesting why it's so it's a bow tie billion machine that could be used at the at a county level to ah if it were ... were hacked and somebody could it could alter hundreds and hundreds of votes perhaps thousands\nThat's part one another part is that it was ... it was the one that was able to be broken and with a with a with a writing pen\nAnd third um it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security or the voting vendors have taken a lot of criticism yes and that's just one of them\nFor kind of sticking their head in the hands on this I'm not realizing that this is a problem and wanting to kind of go way\nUm other other machines have had other problems um you know strange things like researchers finding a Chinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is the ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing then who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even realize\nA Chinese music playlist\nYes it was it was like MP threes if you remember it was a it was a it was an older machine that they that if that they've found this on they'd also found some examples of people um I I it's sending out or or being ... are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tampered with and that way although they had no conclusive evidence\nAnd so we have never have we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on any of the machines are no because we haven't done those friends the audits that you're talking about\nI I think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now are being put on us but but keep in mind of course that now are spent on basically everything these days yeah there's a strong chance that it's that it's happened and I'm just not aware of it in a few people are\nWell Derrick Rose and buck at Tim ... points out that some states use these this particular machine the models six fifty to process ballots for entire counties and you can imagine in closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Bronner University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or to de ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found even when they identify flies is that they don't get fixed so is that a problem with the vendors\nOr with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] those are really important point sort of you know at this\nI'm twenty four team the Russian intelligence services attacked the boat tabulation machines in Ukraine decided to sort of tries to process about election you could see them easily using that same playbook in the U.S\nOn the question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clothes and proprietary based on their bottom line the interests of trying to make money\nAnd were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security to find vulnerabilities um someone big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSomeone here because to the the level to which some of these uh these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as Tim stark says is reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference\nThat a ES and asked election systems and soft or actually I Believe sent a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary of copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nYeah it's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether\nI don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced explanation it reminds me a little bit of back in the older days when uh the music industry was so adamantly protecting things in a way that didn't allow new technology to emerge\nUm so I think there's a problem there now the states or in a position where they unfortunately are under resourced and so don't always have a lot of money to update the systems and keep their security up today to do pattern\nSo there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this is more on the vendors and not being as transparent as they should\nAll right

S. example again election an election systems of software this major vendor of voting machines and in this country because they have issued a statement saying that this report about the hack ability of their machines\nUm ... their statement says that the vote the report can validate that any type of technology can be exploited under conditions where it is made accessible with zero controls which is not the case in an election\nRegarding the M six fifty ESN as first manufactured it um in Nineteen Ninety nine and discontinued manufacture those units in early two thousand eight so major vendor they're saying there isn't a problem ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all that I just want to point out the and six fifty is is a high speed central count scanner that is not used at polling places\nBut I I I think that I Will agree with their premise that all the computers are vulnerable and that Ninety nine percent of our votes in the United states are counted by computers and so those computers need special handling and in order to manage the risk that counting votes by computers present\nAnd so we can never get the risk down to zero\nWhich is why we need to give election officials the tools they need to demonstrate that the software reported the results accurately and that's why we were talking earlier\n[noise] support for on point comes from college fine where consulting work with high school students to identify and itchy their goals in high school and complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more in college ... dot com\nAnd ... sciences offering cola guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be used at home by prescription only information that cold the guard test dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate body we're talking about election integrity at the state and local level about how to be sure the vote you actually cast a ballot you cast it as secure\nAs possible and I'm speaking this hour Tim's Stark's he covers cyber security for political ... Rosen Bach also joined us he's co director of Harvard's bell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project Mary Schneider is with us as well she's president of verified voting national in Texas the election integrity\nAdvocacy group and let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Condos that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that ... who you are\nThat is indeed and all I Am\nWell Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in a how was the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we we feel that will who do we actually started working on cybersecurity are let's just Thirteen\nBlown risk and vulnerability assess but um we had any recommendations or a or put it into art museum that low priority or an animal we've consistently work to get all those recommendations a place having said that we also do\nA penetration passed and we continue to do a a regular penetration tests as well uh and I think that that the important thing to remember for most\nOf for most of your listeners is that uh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very this\nDecentralized system here in Vermont unlike most of the New England we do not have county government Powell level to the state\nLevel or in and you know we've got a lot of things going on and I sat on a panel with Eric Wilson bomb a it back in a a march before the Senate intelligence committee\nA you know we announced at that time that we are implementing soccer authentic tasting yeah we've got Web Web applications fire walls in front of the ...\nWhat will secretary of sensory constantly just somebody who your cell phone dogs also that shaky here but this is a key question to ask you before hopefully your lungs hopefully you will fall apart but\nI Am here that even given the steps that you you said you just take in Vermont to ensure the security of the voting system there as much as possible I mean NBC News is rupe reports that in August in late August there were three different methods\nUsed to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups trying to get access to your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did in Libya but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the world that has a website or anything that isn't getting scanned every day what we experienced was scans our lives\nAre are lot a lot of the systems are showed us where they were coming originating from although you can always count on that but the one that raised our attention if you want to call it um was the one that said Russian Federation we forward is out onto\nA department of homeland security through the communication protocols that we have a developed over the last year\nAnd a I think that that you know our systems are getting paid and thousands of times per day thousands of times per hour the question is how you put the systems in place to defend against it\nBack in two thousand six teams that were Twenty one states that were targeted one state was breached and all goes the conversation was always about the state that was released would never about eight or twenty states that are actually a defended again\nWe favors will receive no I haven't I haven't heard of that which state which was breached Honda is\nA it was I Believe it was I Believe it was a um Illinois\nOkay interesting well one last question for you briefly because they want to turn back to I guess with with what you have to say but but I mean you're in the state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in elections security\n... well now let me uh let me speak for myself a and I must say it's a ... I Believe is that there are some practices that we need to put in place one of them will voter marked paper ballots\nBecause that is really the only way that you can actually audit or we do what we call we usually hide statistical confidence level audits are randomly selected ... pounds\n[noise] doing just grew up in\nYeah [noise] well Jim Condos secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call Norwalk ah Mary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what the secretary of state of Vermont and had to say\nWell I think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter mark paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that was said earlier in the show the kind of audience that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis of machines or\nAnything like that theory a statistical sample of these ballots of the vote 'em are paper ballots that you can check and make sure the software\nI'm ... was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing the risk of vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor to do the same thing\nAnd I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes\nThe elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes around in a very small secretary of State Department so the level of resources is going to vary widely ... I think we keep coming back to this resource question\nWell let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHigh make now I Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machines we switch to voter mark ballot\nCombined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning we have locked suitcases for each district we have a [noise]\nStickers that keep the voting machine from in messed with unless\nSomebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by\nA board of elections on those uh audit sheets how many ballots they have centralized they come shrink wrapped in a package is a fifty we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballads to people that aren't showing up in our um\nOur in our election books so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the at the gave a ballot and\nHave a chance to vote when the voter gets done marking the ballot they have little circles in them for each candidate and um and that yeah they take the paper ballot they get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through\nAt the end of the night we have people who break down the voting machine they a scanner and we have to memory cards inside of the scanner\nOne of the memory cards were able to pop out and we physically hand to a runner who physically takes it down to the board of elections too so that they can do a quick audits not official unofficial southern get it on ...\nAnd then um there is also a second memory chip in the same\nBack from you on that point and and thank you so much because you you said a lot of interesting things that I Want to hear our guests reflect on so Kathleen election inspector from Syracuse New York Thank you for your call Eric Rosen book\nUm I think they're probably several other steps that the more to talk to us about about how New York tries to make their elections as secure as possible does it sound like they're doing living the right thing\nIt sounds like they're doing their jobs are kept when he was one of those state and local election officials that really earned or respect when we have this national level tabletop exercise here in Cambridge, Massachusetts several months ago", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "22"}
