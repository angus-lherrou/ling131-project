... and joining us today from Tampa, Florida is Adam Smith he's political editor for the Tampa Bay times\nAdam welcome to them point thanks good to be here or at first of all let's just jump right into a how the president is sort of positioning himself and his hopes for the ... elections we've heard a little bit of that are on his interview with Lesley Stahl on sixty minutes this weekend\nI'm you know he made he responded to her questions about or his mocking of Christine Blasey Ford and the president actually told stuff\nSaid quote we won the cabinet fight and that it's going to help the GOP in the ... the way\nNow justice Kevin always treated has become a big factor in the ... have you seen what's going on with the polls\nSo enough totally ... let me start with you here what do you make of the president's interview on sixty minutes and sort of how he's placing himself very much in the middle of what's at stake in the midterms\nWhile addressing interesting decision on his part to defend a an earlier speech that he gave where he sort of made fun\nOf Christine Blasey Ford and talked about how she couldn't remember any of the critical details and he took credit for that is helping really locked in judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nI think a lot of people would not necessarily agree with that but we are seeing in the midterms is I think you know a month ago it seemed like the Republicans were going to hold on to the side of the Democrats were going to retake the house\nNow that seems all the more likely are it seems like it's going to be really tough for the Democrats to retake the Senate but they are very good shot\nAt the house and part of that you would expect to see any way because\nA while there was an enthusiasm gap more Republicans are showing excitement about the polls and that's something you expect to see is an election approaches but I think it was accelerated by the cabinet fight in a real us versus them dynamic that takes place it's not unusual what we're seeing with Republican voters where\nYou know early on that we're maybe not that enthusiastic but now that they're faced with the prospect of a takeover by the opposition are getting more excited and more enthusiastic so I think some of what the president says is true in a sense of the dividing line to sharpen and I think some of it would have happened anyway\nI see and I used to

eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk let's go to Steve who's calling from sunspot New Mexico Steve you're on the air\nA question or comment or were you um [noise] we went to a rally in Richmond or ... or ...\nOr for Trump and it was almost like a trip to grow all ah\nIt was just absolutely wonderful uh the uh ... uses Schumer's is a ... or ... or ... or a sharp roost or a little uh [noise] I'm\nEditing or he's the Steelers are starting or before it gets you a question because I Do I Do want to hear your question but since you said you went to that Richmond, Kentucky rally or with the president\nThis weekend um and he said it was wonderful I'm just wondering when the president says things that are demonstrably untrue um you know when he basically says the Democrats want open borders to flood the country with criminals we heard that that clip earlier her\n... they don't know I don't think any Democrat has advocated open borders to flood the country with criminal\nOh yes sir have you're totally wrong\nTo flood the country with ... to flood the country with criminals\nYeah that's correct and one of Thirteen run out of control\nYes but well I guess what I'm Wondering a Steve is that that the president's asserting that the Democrats won commercials that come into the country no Democrat has ever said that so I'm just wondering when he says things that are that are untrue does that does that trouble you at all\nBut it's not it's not on true cause a bribe for correct\nOkay uh and so then you're the question that your your\nYour your side will be wrong\nOr I don't think I've heard a single Democrat say they want to welcome criminals into the country but but you know the question that you that you had for for for a panel\nKind of a moot point ruin a you know the question I Want us to think that a President Trump\nAnd somebody from in front of the bill one or think she'll go outside to grow or for a record for\nOkay we'll see thank you so much for your call or necessarily been David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a a a questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense there okay what do we know\nWhat I was raised because during the sixty minutes interview the president said something about that is being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to\nPraise and it probably was suggesting that I'd I'm mad as has somewhat more you know perhaps dovish views for lack of a better term and the president doesn't certain things and that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nA modest was going to stay that long after the midterms in midterms are traditionally of time with a lot of cabinet members may leave and perhaps Mattis is on that list\nUm I think it's a little early to know where he would go for a replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former lawmaker but there is some precedent for going to the corporate world I think it's early to say but I think uh it was the first time I wish that I knew of that are there had been that clear of a signal from the White House\nBut the possibility that Madison might not be around for that much longer was in the air\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had asked the color about ... what he thought of\nWhen the president says things that are are untrue and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at these rallies the the president does say things that that we can prove are have no\nNo and no evidence behind them and I ... I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have our potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response to that\nFor people at those rallies and and I've been to a few rallies I I was at a rally in Iowa at last week I think our\nTime runs together with a with a with a President Trump but\nThe people at these rallies at they were so energized\nThey were amped up they are you know they are true believers\nSo I I don't know whether they take everything that Trump says that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes but they they are his fans regardless he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people\nOutside and that that that clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they're they're not thousands of people outside but he says these things\nBut I don't know that at this point whether it makes much of a difference to the people that support him that like ... ah that are entertained by the things that he said and that that's the core things that he says resonates with them for a swing voters\nIf you are skeptical of President Trump then these things being point pointed out ah make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kind of have to start from a place of if you're already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith the that same question to you as as as Asia said it seems as if it's the the swing voters who could be a influence or or push either way of based on what the president says things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nAnybody can find the swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody's so dug in on both sides\nBut I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture take some of the things that Trump says when he's being a little tongue in cheek we send it sometimes take it too seriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea or no\nBut there are things that are that the the crowds and they are just an enormous crowds or don't quite take literally like we do now that have\nHad our caller who said that everything the president said was true and yeah and push back on me several times\nAnd if he can my email is a Smith and Tampa Bay dot com if he can email me the name of a single Democrat that said he wants to open borders of more criminals can come in you know I Will have we eat my reporter's notebook [laughter] barbeque in ...\nI mean just to jump in had enough time I mean it may be that he wasn't saying the Democrats are declaring that they're in favor of criminals coming in and that that's the impact of everything that they want to do I mean that's sort of I took what he was trying to say but\nTo me the color you are really exemplified to the extent to which were in this country in a very much an us versus them situation\nAnd the people who are motivated seems to me ah as much or more by hatred sometimes with the other side as belief in their own side it's one reason I think that as we approach the election uh there's more energy from the Republicans because the prospect of democratic takeover pointing to people like\nNot only Nancy Pelosi but even Hillary Clinton as a villain who could be empowered if the election goes the wrong way and it's a very resonant with a lot of people and it's I think we're seeing one reason for the energy on on both sides really this absolute\nA disc taste and dislike an aversion to people on the other side of the political debate\nMm well let's go to David who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma you're on the air David\nHi magnet panel I I was watching the sixty minutes interview and I was absolutely astonished that Trump's projection of\nThe streets and the viciousness uh putting that on the Democrats um which is something we typically does is just sort of you know smoke and mirrors everything I mean if you look at the Capitol hearings as an example of a justice are supposed to be impartial he does Fox News interviews he brings Hillary Clinton up in his opening statement\nA for a doctor or drop\nApologizes for Kavanaugh and history and I'm not a word about Dr Ford um but then you go to the actual questioning and the Republicans I realize\nBecause we aren't just public radio the are the public radio\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from W.

joined today by ... she's NPR's White House correspondent Adam Smith is also with us he's political editor for the Tampa Bay times and the Taliban David joins us as well he's an editor at the wall Street Journal the Washington bureau and\nAnd we've got lots of comments coming in here's one from our website or on point radio dot org DX oath says the fact that Florida keeps being hit with storm should make them start to think twice about politicians like governor Rick Scott\nWho deny it climate change and\nSince we're just talking about storms and climate change we should play this moment from President Trump's interview with Leslie stall on sixty minutes a lovely still open with hurricane Michael it asks the president\nIf he still thinks climate change is a hoax now the president didn't necessarily a he said he didn't necessarily trust scientists because he believes scientists have a political agenda uh and then he said this\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um I don't want to give trillions in trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs\nI don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nAyesha Rascoe let me just turn to you quickly on that I mean the scientific consensus is overwhelming that our current and the climate change that we're seeing is indeed a human driven or human exacerbated or just your thoughts on hearing a that clip from the president\nIt was interesting because when the when the White House and and when President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year there were a lot of questions from reporters are constantly you know asking uh the the White House\nDoes President Trump still believe that climate change is a hoax and they kind of refused to answer and at that time\nPresident Trump wasn't giving interviews like he's giving now\nSo this is like the first time that he was really pressed on climate change since he became president and he's basically repeating even though he's not he said it's not a hoax he's still repeating this idea that he doesn't really believe it or he doesn't think that it's really an issue\n... well uh I should note that the president tweeted today that he's going to Florida in Georgia with the first lady to tour hurricane damage and visit with FEMA first responders and law enforcement or so to that point let's go to a color here Beth is calling from St Petersburg Florida you're on the air Beth\nHi ah I'm just curious I'd love to hear Adams\nPolitics will play on recovery of hurricane Michael because yeah you have Trump coming and um and he sort of control the purse strings Trump and Scott Republican versus Democrat and happening backyard pretty much so I'd love to hear you on that\nBest thank you for your call Adam go ahead\nWell if I'm One of the people in those are hard hit communities in North Florida I'm actually should be pretty happy that this that everything is so political and we're just a few weeks away from the election because lord knows Rick Scott and Donald Trump or going to do everything they can to look like they are effectively responding to this thing\nUh that said you know you've got some candidates Andrew Gillum a is basically sort of shut down his overt campaigning so he can stay in a\nIn ... in Tallahassee and look like he's involved you've got candidates like ... just the fellow who's running for governor who is struggling to get attention and to some extent Bill Nelson our senior senator who whom Rick Scott is running against\nIs also I think having a little bit of a hard time getting noticed so politics never disappears uh but that said I think it's a it's a very very big motivator to respond properly\nYeah well let's switch gears here then and talk about uh the increasing tensions and questions around uh\nThe disappearance and as the as the as Turkish officials are saying the murder of journalist and dissident Jamal a ...\nAnd the Taliban David or the president's tweeting today that he just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia and the king denies any knowledge whatsoever of whatever may have happened\nTo show the a and that now the president President Donald Trump saying he immediately sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to meet with the Saudi king your thoughts on that well\nIt's a bit of a mixed message coming out of the White House and whether that's by design or simply because that's how they are a little bit hard to say uh it's true he did say that about Saudi Arabia reminded me a little bit of some of his comments about\nA president putting you know he says that ah they denied very strongly he said it could be some rogue actors are in the case of the Russians you may recall he said it could be some four hundred pound guy on the bad I don't need a lot of other yeah you know based on you know I don't think is a lot of other people suggesting it could be ruled killers unconnected to\nSaudi Arabia um so the one hand and the sixty minutes interview he talked about that there's going to be severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis are behind it and the other hand he's taken the idea of canceling our arms deals with the Saudis off he he he's just\nTaking that off the table a and his ... talked about how much he has a good relationship with them but then he turns around and sends pump HBO and talks about getting to the bottom of it and it just I think in some ways a reflection of our fairly complex relationship\nWith Saudi Arabia where they are an authoritarian country without any question on the other hand we have a lot of commercials relate relations with them we sort of counting them to be a stabilizing force in the middle east and the one last thing I just want to say is is President Trump tends to have kind of a\nPersonal relationship with leaders that's how he describes it he'll he'll say whether he means it literally or not that he and Kim fell in love with each other or he and president Xi have\nChemistry it's for him a lot about how he feels his personal relationships are with these folks and it's clear that the leader of Saudi Arabia had been some you know and be asked as people call him\nYou know had a very strong effect not only on a leaders in Washington but also let's face it on many journalists he's a charismatic guy and all these things are complicating factors in as\nWell uh nothing really since you mentioned that moment in the sixty minutes interview let's hear it or this is when the president told Leslie stall that he would be quote very upset and angry if the Saudi Government a de de de to assassinate ... but then as now Taliban David points out President Trump also

radio dot org Stephen Walt looking back to them point to be here\nSo first of all a you describe where you you you you ... what you see as a America's one of America's enemies eating a foreign policy forces as a liberal had Gemini that's the kind of at the center of your book what do you mean by liberal a Gemini\nWell it's a shorthand term for the grand strategy of the United states has been following so since the end of the Cold War I'm it's liberal not in the sense of being left wing or right versus right wing but liberal in the sense that it seeks to promote\nThe classical liberal values of individual rights democracy free markets\nOr things like that and it's a Gemini or because it sees those things can only be spread around the world if they're done under American leadership at America's Best and through the active use of American power in some cases including the use of military power\nSo when you think about it this is a strategy that doesn't seek to preserve the status quo it would actually wants to revise politics all over the world\nMake poor countries like the United states do that peacefully if possible but if necessary using other means as well and that's basically been the objective of every American president since the end of the cold\nEnding tyranny in our world [noise]\nEven to a\nDifferent people from two different parties here a ... roughly the same idea that you call this policy failure right why\nWell there's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three were restricted

democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first

essentially a a late nuclear power and oh India Pakistan and North Korea have all tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat\nIn lots of different places of Freedom House are reported last year that it was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal is to end tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point um the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the cost we've seen in a variety of different places\nWithout a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy of ... worldwide is it that it can be see that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places uh Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in hungry backsliding in Poland or suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transforming the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed a you had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS\nUm the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi led to a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better\nAnd by the way from all of this is going on then countries like Russia and China\nAnd Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not are really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nA one reaction is you seize Crimea to stop the Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable when in terms of its ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places so one of the question\nNow this notion of the primacy of the U. S. project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty that America had to the world being as guiding light for democracy ah but you said that there's an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nThat idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking about\nA it's a a broad a group of set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially what I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy the defense department intelligence services State Department so they are part of this\nOf this whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that right and comment on foreign issues are pretty much a daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and often go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about\nUm and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the ... the Gemini this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals\nAnd there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three um you see that in the fact that people tend to circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotations you've been a playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals\nBut as I Want to get to him in ... in a second about how you if you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but Iraq is it the disaster of the Iraq War is isn't\nIt it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to dive into that a little bit 'cause you know you said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but it wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security the United states I mean that's part of what you say here that the foreign policy elite as\nFrequently are collected issues of security in order to uh to get people on board with this idea of spreading democracy I mean isn't Iraq with a perfect example of that\nUm I I think it ... it shows you how easy it is to steer 'em a stir the debate and one of the points I make in the book is that\nThe foreign policy elite that especially presidents in the executive branch have all sorts of advantages in selling policies to the world\nUm and I point out that there's actually a pretty significant gap between what the American people actually say they want they want a more restrained foreign policy they don't want to engage in all these crusades around the world [noise]\nSo how do you convince them to go a long\nWhile you do the things that the Bush administration did but again it's not unique to the Bush administration you inflate threats\nYou pretend enemies or ten feet tall and have to be deal dealt with immediately you exaggerate the benefit\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from Charles River apparel making the new Englander rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare folks for whatever the day has in store for a new phone collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com\nAnd told me advice or a matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners\nCan read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home and visor dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making to shock her body we're speaking today with Stephen Walt his new book is the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy\nA and professor Walt lots of comments coming in or just read a couple of them to you on Twitter pole moves or us is saying questioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\n... says Noam Chomsky debunk this and wall should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing a David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion is the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera even uses a stalking horse for American\nCorporate had Gemini which is highly questionable democratizing influence uh just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all the Walt\nI'm I'm sort of sympathetic to both comments I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very careful are heavily drift\nSense yes the United states has favor to ah you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all um\nAnd in some cases there have been corporations that had particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually\nDon't benefit corporations at all go back to the uh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton and oil services corporation to do business with Iraq or to do business with Iran\nOr Cheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning both\nOf them and then that very same person is ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts there\nThat's right yeah I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention too hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things and things like that [noise]\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that has ... has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in ... and the desire to end now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger\nYes but so I'm just a follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now ... some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think at the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks and organizations who not not surprising these and want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money [laughter]\nAll right well ... let's at least get a couple of them in here ... calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nHi thanks so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think are under under our current president\nUm who was an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with well I worry that are American values are going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and\nAh the\nAh journalists a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nThank you for your call Stephen Walt well in some respects I think uh our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and wanted to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well but there are national security or others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to wind out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a Saudi journalist can show you are in Istanbul and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it\nPresident Trump has been waffling it seems to me on this one ah that his initial statements\nYou know in typical Trump Ian fashion\nKicking up sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it\nUm [noise] it's I think you know the the concern that caller has is exactly right here and I think one of the larger issues with President Trump is his inability to separate out some of his own personal interest and possibly personal financial interest from the broader interest of the country\nWell so let's talk more about the Trump Administration now because you open your book saying that um then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of\nHis view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just just to remind folks what what the president the then candidate Trump said when he critiqued the status quo of U.S foreign policy here is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the cold or a foreign policy veered badly oh of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nLogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April to thousands sixteen now Stephen Wall we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions that President has made since then I mean about the Paris climate accord about or his a disc discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton talking about expanding the American mission in Syria beyond the Syrian civil war and to\nContainment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region or so here's national security visor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran or at a group called a United against a nuclear Iran summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed the hell to pay\nThe John Bolton there are Stephen Walt not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is this is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour um\nI think in the twenty sixteen campaigned Trump who's not a sophisticated thinker on these things but he did in to it ah that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lot of people out of their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could out or tried to tell her foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is a ... ah since Trump became president although his style his approach to the president and his\nPublic style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive\nWhat strikes me most about it is how he has been pulled back in a lot of these same directions\nI'm certainly uh the fact that ah having complained about nation building and we're not going to we're going to get out of the nation building business you know he send more troops to Afghanistan or as you are a couch with you now seems to be willing to commit the United states to stay in Syria a much longer even though we don't really have an idea of what we're trying to accommodate\nPotentially indefinitely\nBought a hook line and sinker the idea that Iran is some mortal threat to American interests are throughout the middle east uh and that of course\nHas led him to double down with Saudi Arabia doubled down with a Egypt a double town with Israel as well but notice but those are all of our traditional Middle East ally so he's not doing anything different there\nYou'll recall he was very critical of NATO a NATO countries head start spending more they had actually started spending more even in the Obama administration would of course he has no reaffirmed the American a commitment to NATO in a variety of ways as well\n\nAnd it comes to the among the\nTop candidates for governor sponsored by the University of\nRhode Island the public's radio and the Providence Journal were coming to you from Edwards call at the your eye campus in king's tense Armenian dies political reporter for the public's radio\nQuestions and modeling this stupid moderating in this debate along with Providence Journal statehouse reporter\nAnderson and your mind senior we Anna Blakeman editor in chief of your eyes campus newspaper the good five cent cigars\nHer audience to respect the candidates and the moderators and fleas avoid applause and sharing until the very end of the debate so we can make the most of our time here\nNow I'd like to introduce mechanics Ken thanks for the last independent candidates and show true well modern party candidate William Gilbert democratic nominee governor Gina Raimondo and Republican nominee Cranston mayor Allen fun we appreciate you can't I see here\nLet's get right into it and I'll ask the first question is you will have\nTo respond to earlier today I pick names out of a hat\nShoot joke trailer you will do first based on not drawing\nChoked fill out a report surfaced last week about your involvement in a neighborhood to do with a young Nicholas Matty yellow and Cranston back in Nineteen Seventy five\nYou were acquitted on an oven assault charge in that in his view\nBut we're also surface to more recent scuffle between you and another lawmaker state house and you've been involved in some other disputes ... right temperament to be governor [noise]\nWell I think there's no question that I have the right temperament to be governor especially at this time I think we need a ... a government as it's not afraid to go head on with the special interest to the controlling this thing and all that kind of guy I'm not a laid back easygoing guy if you're looking for that it's not me\nBut on the guy that's going to get in your face and I'm going to tell you we're not going to love you to continue to do what you've been doing because we need to go into state governments we need to clean it up and it's got to be cleaned up like it's never been cleaned up before and you need a guy like me to clean it up\nWilliam Gilbert you could perhaps use some of the publicity that Mr Grillo as attracted the moderate party has not been getting a lot of recognition this year tell us what do you accomplishing by running for governor this year\nSo I Want to thank everybody for having me and this is very important real estate's I Want to use it wisely and what I'm trying to accomplish here today is exactly what we just heard Mr ... well he's a very nice guy there's a lot of personality that there's a lot of personality to push somebody away or your your personality pulls be buried\nWould you please respect the discussion we're having here and not interrupt the candidates Mr Gilbert\nThat's fine um what I find it as I Want to talk about issues and we have a pet unfunded pension liability is we have problems or education system we have a uh\nBut I don't want to do is I don't want to get into the mud ruin things to ... your time is valuable to talk about issues other forty years old you're issues are way too valuable to get into the name calling or the or the trumps hat but I Want and phone more so we need to start doing so we can move this forward and we've got to start holding the rhetoric down\nWe got to be able to have dinner with each other and talk politics today at the dinner table my girlfriends are over there she doesn't want to talk politics and this is the one place I feel safe we can finally talk politics\nWe kind of things that we have to do we\nThat I Want to get forward\nYou know what like access to justice is huge you know we got a problem with family court or sometimes it takes two and three years for a\nFor a custody issues will be decided that's way too long for a ten year old not to know where to live and if we're going to have conversations about ... some behavior or Alan phones had it's just all wrong I'm going to use this time to talk\nAbout issues I got a bullet point number so I look forward to run down those issues and hopefully it would be going into a joint of different moving you have to be Republican you don't have to be Democrats how many Democrats think we should have a balanced budget I Believe a balanced budgets how many Republicans are pro choice I think we're all mixed\nIn what I Want to try to do in order to bring people together it's nice [noise] my name is bill Gilbert I'm not going to answer these questions are getting the mud I take your time is way more valuable thing\nGovernor were much do you seem to be the biggest beneficiary of joke furloughs presence in the race while the Republicans are concerned that he is that true thriller is cycling votes from mirror fungal what voters be better served by a more direct\nFinal three weeks for the race focused on you and ... if ... if you're a trailer trucks out\nThank you and thank you you are I think you to the people's radio and the Providence Journal for hosting this forum ah it's great to be here and I appreciate all the folks that have come out\nUh I Would say absolutely not and it's a trailer has every right to run he has a good deal of supporters to my mind this election is about one thing as a ... as\nAs you said there's a lot of noise that's cut through the noise\nA few years ago we had the highest unemployment rate in the nation roads and bridges that were the worst in America schools falling apart and not even a plan or a strategy to fix it\nSo I became governor and brought a lot of change change the way we do labor and training completely changed your economic development strategy changed the way they fix roads and bridges\nAnd for the first time ever put forth a serious school construction program and today\nWe have more people working in Rhode Island than at any point in our history\nWe have more roadwork going on at any point in my lifetime and most of your lifetimes so the question for the ... on the ballot is do you want to continue with that change finish the job and keep going until every Rhode Island or has a shot at a job\nEvery other man on the stage wants to undo what I've been doing and take us right back to where we came from and I think that's the choice between me and everybody else that the voters have in November\nMarathon Republicans might not market for help on that point doesn't show troll have just as much right as you to be running for governor\nWell first of all thank you you our eyes in a public radio promise stronger for having all this on the stage today by the way to go I'd be happy to have dinner with the way anytime I enjoy spirited discussion or the dinner table or because I think that's what's been missing\nYou know right now or that question is is just asked me probably should have been asked to Joel ah because of Joe how are you for what he said oh and the Providence Journal just this weekend\nYou feel their responsibility jobs trying to take away votes for me and you heard it clearly when the governor tonight that she doesn't want to drop off a guy's been cast\nThe deal's been caught the bottom line for me is read this election or bills writer isn't about what's going on in Washington DC it's about what's going on in our backyards and you know this\nDog owner has lost her way she's folks more on August they fund raising a the caring about awesome taking care of business would island is a pattern now she has her chance for the past four years I'll budget has increased by over ... billion dollars and not herself in the audience\nAre we waiting laughs at the DMV I'll even getting trash cans ... beach simple things that matter\nMy plans will put us back on the right track I won't make sure we have in common sense reform inspector generals to make sure we rode out waste and fraud and get spending back in ... take care of all the last\nThank you I appreciate the opportunity to respond last congressman mayor's Cranston for twice as long as I think that there and watch a show for at\nFive tax increases plus car tax increases I've cut taxes every single year than them and are a pension system that's twenty four percent funded that means it people at risk of not getting their pension\nAnd not even thinking bringing about all day kindergarten until I became governor and brought about all day kindergarten for every child in Rhode Island I think the choice this time\nMiracle would you be thirty seconds and then when they move on to do I got to really the city's dishonest\nAre especially about the car tax that car tax has\nBeen frozen for decades now\nHad nothing to do with it but the bottom line is let's take a look at the governor and watch the lives of choose told to the pension ears to grandma's coal the shoes stolen and put it on the back and so all of our Wall Street hedge fund friends\nAnd to take a look at you know the real return she's getting it on the back end for her and vestments um you know that she has been a blind trust okay not that hot right move on we're going to Patrick Anderson\nMr Gilbert moving on to the issues are the tax cut that was passed in Washington earlier by the Republican Congress was a big source of debate here and tell us where did you support it can do you think it's ... it's been good for Rhode Island's since passed\nDon't I don't think the data has come in on that you know there was a big silence and the stock market is when the\nYou know one of the things that I Want to invest more in is a in a stem education field there's a lot of good paying careers out there\nUm with engineering you know many students are here and you All right thanks to the robotic programs that are going on in a quick island which you know I got to brag you know my in laws are been harder for generations now\nWe've got to do more to invigorated the younger kids that are followers good career pathway invest a lot more and career in fact\nUh even if you have regional centers look what's going on with the programs at Princeton west in his career tech center up upon again to also down and Wesley if we keep these regional centers are providing the appropriate skill sets for the children to be ready for the careers of the future\nAnd get into higher education once they're done with high school and they're ready to prepare for the basics\nThen they have that choice because not everyone has that ability to go to college\nYou know there are good paying jobs performers electricians my brother in law's an electrician there's good pay out there we have to do more and for you All right you guys should be treated as a flagship university I said this four years ago\nWith a little dollars if you get you should have your own water governance here make your own decisions cut the cord in the future when your rank\nYou I'm Mr ... how would you answer that question how are you planning on making higher education more accessible for students and the state\nBefore we can start talking about giving away more free college education I think what we need to do is\nMake sure that the kids were sending into programs are capable of handling the college programs that they're going in and what I Would do is poor old few more restrictions on them but we try to keep the program but I think what we really need to do is begin to look at where we can save money\nGovernor reminder was more six hundred and thirty five million dollars of taxpayer money with the you have a crisis\nShe's lost another five hundred million dollars of pension money with her pension investments when she wished treasure\nAnd she's benefited by getting millions and millions of dollars relief for her by the very people that she's stitched took that have contributed to her that she's given business to look like the people that support the un computer program\nThe bottom line is and Allen is just as bad because he's raised about a million dollars all of which are the majority of the big donors are coming from all the lobbyist to can control the state those are the people who are affecting you\nBefore we can do more with education than we can do more to change things in ... in South Korea stuff we need to get every body part of the back pocket which they call them and you can't do that by electing people like those too you know bought and paid for by the time\nAnd then finding us together how would you make college education more accessible for asking [laughter]\nI think education is probably the biggest issue that we can do in Rhode Island right now\nI really think that we took her education programs and couple of them as an economic engine we can we can do kill two birds with one stone I Want to start exporting high quality high value employees and if if I if ice create enough high value employees the businesses are going to come also\nWe we got a great place to live I live here by accident\nI can live anywhere I Want but I live here this on purpose I I Love the beaches I loved the coastline I Love everything about it but I tell you right now we have a nurse problem we have an nurse shortage if you look at your I look at the CIA and you look at ... you have a higher standard to get into the nursing program than you do just university we can expand that those programs\nAnd it gets them nurses and we can increase education I think for I think education that we need to talk of parity before\nI started increasing the bubble over here I got to get to parity between some of our school districts because we're not doesn't work for everybody who works for a lot of people\nAnd I don't miss it throw doesn't like to hear that but there are people that it doesn't work for we need full day kindergarten that's something I Want to push for I think at least pre K for all title one schools that's a place because we do we gotta get we have to get that\nEducation level there's third graders fifth grade they see it on to the eighth grade but then we got into the ... got to get into the vocational training we need to think big and we need to start pumping out electricians plumbers plasterer heating and air conditioning guys these Raleigh tire we had no message right now in\nGilbert, Arizona [noise] you're listening to them live in Detroit debate at the University of Rhode Island the army and honest political reporter for the public's radio joined by Providence Journal statehouse reporter Patrick Anderson and University of Rhode Island students journalist ...
