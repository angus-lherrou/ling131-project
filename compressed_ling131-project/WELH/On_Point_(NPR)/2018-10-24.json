passionate review of extra comments gonna have to wait I'm the first time I held a gun a my ex father in law handed it to me\nI really didn't have an interest in guns I knew them from TV watching movies or listen to a lot of rap music\nBut there where they weren't really a part of my childhood and they weren't really a part of my adult life either but this was the first gun that I held because it was presented to me\nIt was something that Charles was very proud of and it was also present it to me in such a way that you might present a plaque or a trophy or an heirloom like\nI'm a huge football fan right so if I had a football that with autographed by Bob Stoops juice in white sand Bradford I Would present in much the same way and that's how\nIt came off later but at the moment it's to me it's still a gun yeah I was kind of looking at\n... and it was looking at her mother Nancy and I was going just regular you know but in that moment you really don't ask questions you you take it you look it over and you hand it back before it burns your hands\nRight so so Lizzie was your then girlfriend and and as you said this was the first time that you were meeting her family and you barely walked in the door right\nWell this is the first time I was meeting her father father are located right right right and and and and oh no go ahead go ahead go ahead\nNo I I I was just going to

guns and we have a a excerpt of that book at our website on point radio\nDot org and and RJ just just before the break you were telling us about your your first experience at all of this massive gun show\nIn in Tulsa, Oklahoma a but there's so much detail that you write about the justice one experience we can spend the whole hour talking about it um but I but I Want to just kind of fast forward to the key moment here is that\nA is that Charles your\nYour uh you are one time father in law are uh he ended up actually buying you again at the gun show isn't that right\nYeah and I think\nWhat people don't take from that is that where I'm from Oklahoma\nGuns or a way of life and not always for the reasons that we might think were the reasons that we might read about they are integral to the way that fathers get to know their son yeah\nAnd in some instances when you're much younger that father might buy you a twenty two rifles so you can go on the Web it's or or you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something fatherly for me which was by me my first gun\n... what kind of gun was it like twenty six color baby luck that you can ... why did you choose that one because I was interested in self defense as much as\nAny other part I Marchman ship came later but at that moment you know we're talking about ... we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding what lethal force is we're talking about um\nThe mechanics of self defense shooting of defense of shooting a and we're talking about why some people\nHad a gun buying firearms and a even as far back as when eleven twenty twelve and what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I was not having conversations about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles yeah\nYeah so what was he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms and twenty tend to an eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people feel\nWe have laws that say this and people are very very interested and letting everyone else no if you come over here you might not walk away and that for many is a deterrent\nUh-huh I I mean I guess one thing I was wondering is um ... ... just before a un after President Obama was first elected we saw a a surgeon gun sales did that ever entered the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks uh it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right and this is the state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have what are called\nUm [noise] at the time or academy sports and you can walk in there and and by any real caliber of handgun ammunition\nAnd how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's there's kind of a surplus and people can't really move firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was in office because a lot of people still harbor to fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and tried to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of salt right for this kind of handgun a and does while you know\nFictitious were also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do it does not matter\nIf what you believe isn't what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word\nDon't tell them to their face that they're wrong you're going to irritate them and make them mad now make you there for your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out and that's where I was trying to take this conversation\nOr even before you know I I even thought that I might entertained becoming that good with a pistol and I we get stymied mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about\nYeah you know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir where you talk about uh the day that you got home\nOr or ... or or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had had purchased for it you could you read that part of the demand more to us\n[noise] yes ma'am Scott lotta Oxford comma isn't it um\n[noise] the day I got back home with my new gun still in its box set it on my bed and looked at it for some time I had an open to that the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud\nWhat I felt was something more like fear like the fear I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the being who was so much trouble he drowned the planet cast out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love\nFear the way I was taught to feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police stay out of jail and stay alive\nI knew that the first time I lost respect for that pissed on a larger than my fist it could kill me or getting me killed open the box and picked up the clock I was amazed at how intrude if it was the process of removing the empty magazine putting it back and wrecking the slide\nAnd with a gun tends to feel a lot like Superman with X ray vision laser citing poll smash strength which is why telling that person to use those super powers will generally result in the person looking at you like your lunatic\nAppointed a gun at the white white bedroom wall and my second storey apartment and squeezed feeling the hard click of the trigger the soft tap the hammer and an empty chamber\nI put the gun back in its case knowing that next week the chamber would no longer be empty and that this bit of polymer plastic and metal would no longer be inexpensive paper wait what a weapons so lethal I Wish we could invent it lets\nRJ young reading an excerpt of this new memoir led bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey into guns\nAre gay I you know I Wonder if you could explain to folks who are listening to that that X or do you do you showed this deep respect for the power of the weapon in your hands uh some\nUh definitely conflicted feelings about having it at all so how is it that you got from that to being a certified NRA shooting instructor\n[noise] I got to a point in my journey that I wanted to answer one fundamental question that was present it to me over and over and over again as a truism the truism was\nA good guy with a gun is better than a bad guy with a gun and I put a question mark at the end of that statement and wanted to find out for myself if that was true\nAnd us began countless rounds and trips to the gun range to get good really really good like master Yoda ... this is how you use the force good\nYeah [noise] and and you did it\n... yeah yeah I did but your heart outrage and given ...\n[laughter] but you know I mean so the thing is is that you have\nYou just you you telling them and more and you're describing to us now how you know in order to connect with your ... your father in law and you're just owned passionate really throw yourself in understanding this culture that he's so much a part of that you become as you said like you're pursuing a jet I Dream\nBut but I have to underscore like on the very next page of from the ex if that you just read you write specifically that you were preparing for an odyssey into white gun culture not just gun culture in general but white gun culture as as a young black men so\n[noise] support from point comes from the listeners of WB you are

RJ young he's author of the new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey\nInto guns or an arcane just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association [noise] ah I I'm just what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there's multiple there were a bunch of reasons why the association was formed a protection to the the desire for self protection amongst\nAfrican Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about a African Americans and gun history in America\nYeah and I got the profile dug for the book and so that was cool and heard his voice in quite some time it's been on tape but that's that's the message the messages there is a responsible way to use this there are folks like myself\nA who believe that they should be armed for self defense and there is the historical aspect of guns were taken from people who look like you and that is not something that you get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\nSo I'm just wondering I [noise] I I hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of African Americans maybe there's increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps ... especially in recent years [noise] but\nAh RJ did you ever feel like you were actually potentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around the question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was a legal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident speaks more to what the NRA should have died in an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like ... and like Doug Jefferson and the people for which at organization represents but in ...\nI'm going to help me man a magnet let me let let me let me break it down a I walked into studio right where I'm a member careless you shut up\nAnd I have on a Black Panther shirt Scott ... on it because that's what the movie's really about I have one a Black Panther hatch what kind of stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have locks that are rated up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't going to be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm dressed and also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not ah I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go round is if that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around as if a gun in a room is not bigger than any elephant you can walk in there you're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say\nAnd that's not correct and that's not right but it is true it is a fear\nSo in the course of getting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist and I am asking questions I'm looking at data and I'm looking at statistics and I'm taking account of my own experience\nAnd what I come to flat out is not only am I not safer I'm In more danger if I have a gun on my person if I have a gun within reach\nHey I'm thinking about your former father in law Charles now did\nDid you ever have ... did you ever tell them this that that the the very same\nDesire for self protection that made it made him such a firearms enthusiast or even if he shared that desire you actually felt less safe a ... because of the fact of race in America when you had the weapon then before you didn't is that something that he he he understood\nLater later as we continue to go through this and later as I had my credentials as I had a standing firm which do you have to continue this discussion like we had spoken about I hadn't fired a gun but I also was able to outline this in the book with a use of force attorney here in Oklahoma\nAnd he had a similar discussion with a friend of his uh this attorney was white his friend is black and his friend who he was\nReally respect for four of and was reading about said hey man when I get pulled over and you get pulled over it's just different and I don't need you to tell me that it's not I don't need you to tell me that people should not judge me by the color of my skin I Need you to recognize that it does happen and to support me\nIn a way you can support me is to speak up for me in the rooms that I'm not in that I'm not allowed in that I might not ever walk into and I thought that was where I got to with Charles I could see that toward the end\nYeah well our Jay hang on here for just a second so many interesting people about this conversation uh or or about this issue I should say\nI Want to bring in one more voice Tiffany where joins us now she is joining us from Cincinnati, Ohio and she's founder of the brown girls project a group that offers makeup workshops and other activities for building self esteem and African American

or organizing firearms classes\nI'm organizing the firearm classes sad hundred Twenty one so a couple of years I'm owning one for about a year\nOkay and so and before that ... ... ...\nReally ah I have a grandfather from ... Georgia though he's a hunter um so you know he had an old shot gun that he kept in the house yet five daughters and two granddaughters and we knew that what that was but there was a trainee know interacting with it\nI see so what what uh what was the reason it took you to buy a gun\n[noise] um actually it it it was the\nNew I don't want to say new but this heightened racial to climate and the area that I live in um that made me say I need to be able to protect myself and as a single mother or be able to protect my children\nUm during the Trump campaign and you know\nMy children were very very\nUm tuned into what was happening but have a new uh politics and they were able to feel the tension drive as well\nUm and they were very concerned and when a Trump gotten off as my son who was Fifteen at the time was very emotional about it and he he was concerned\nNow what was going to happen to us people were being I'm feeling okay to be more aggressive to say things that they didn't say before who are either they invade your your personal space and he'd heard all these stories what if somebody does something to us\nAnd him being you know I have a friend and a daughter and then it's myself you've got to go I have to protect you guys and I'm like no way kid that's my job and then I thought about it like how would I really\nDo do you ... Hannah I'm ... I'm Sorry I didn't I didn't mean to interrupt there but do you really do you feel now that having a gun has made you and your families safer\n[noise] um [noise] I feel protected I feel that if someone crosses my threshold I have something other than my fifth and iron to throw\n'em I feel that at night when my kids were coming home for extra curricular activities and the seasons change that has gotten darker um if someone were to approach it I definitely feel like I'm I can handle myself and and make my kids safe\nYeah uh ... what do you what do you have to say the Tiffany 'cause I I I hear her and I hear the voice of someone who feels\nThat uh the the places that we usually look for protection in society\nGovernment law enforcement et cetera to our fellow citizens that there's a failure there which is why she felt like she she needed to to buy a firearm a to protect her and her kids\nThat perhaps a sense of society feeling us is also a reason why a lot of white gun owners buy a gun and it just to me feels\nI understand Tiffany's desire of course every parent wants to protect their child but it feels like we've we've all we're all feeling each other if we're turning to weapons as a means ... means for protection\nI had this very discussion I'm with my girlfriend here recently who\nIs in charge of a five year old and a three year old both girls and she's a single mom so yeah she's going to do everything in her power\nTo protect her children now I don't have children\nNews update coming up next benefits on point\nOn the public radio\n\nMajor funding from point is provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are SUVs and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance at ... dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nSome WVU are Boston and NPR I met her body this is on point Will Wright was working at a Florida\nThe the chicken in the industrial of and she was pregnant at risk of miss carrying so she took a doctor's note to her supervisor who said\nTo me is you know if I can do the job that I can go out and walk out the doors\nWill bright as one of several women featured in a New York times investigation into pregnancy discrimination a problem that produces more than forty years after the first law was passed to prevent it up next on point pregnancy and workplace discrimination [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington on corporate Coleman the secret service says it is intercepted too suspicious packages one was addressed of the home of former president Morocco bomb and was discovered in Washington DC the second suspicious package was addressed a former secretary of State Hillary Clinton at her home in New York\nSecret Service says neither Obama nor Clinton were at risk of receiving the packages\nThe two candidates for governor of Georgia faced off their first official debate last night doesn't eat ... from member station WBUR a B.

happened and why that series was co reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and ... and they they joined us today and we also want to hear from\nFrom you do you think that a workplace accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask recombination from your employer uh and got them or were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm\nHaving your work changed because of your pregnancy might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your dismissal were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred and forty three talk also want to hear from employers about uh the situation from from your point of view\nIf you're an employer how much combination can you make and what are the realistic concerns and employers have about the limits too accommodating uh employees during pregnancy again we're at eight hundred for two or three to five five\nNow I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there if\nYou're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas and two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it\nAnd she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for her supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor and got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't accept you know because we have\nWater I don't see because you have the water fountains available to you I was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of having this big deal and they read and scrutinizing my doctorate I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested\nAnd listen to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you'd have to go\nThat's how they're Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen\nNow Jessica silver Greenberg and Natalie ... uh in the course of your reporting how did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you've found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt a big head experience in the workplace while they were pregnant\nSo I think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common to experience was\nWhen you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the wave at me too has and\nWe were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of very similar experiences from women all the way up\nWhich jobs in office jobs for this most recent story on miscarriage I can say that ah we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis together um\nAnd uh we had\nTo in many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal than devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us\nYeah and and I imagine the the extreme difficulty that the the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to the extreme difficulty with compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were there ... yeah\nExactly um so it was a paycheck and I was also health insurance and again just and I talk to people who were still working at the warehouse so these are folks who are at again great personal risk\nComing forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job\nRight now I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that the the warehouse company that use that many of these women or all the women in their ... ... your second story most of them that where they work\nDid the company not also said that the ... the allegations because of uh currently though their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\nYes they they did say that they said that um they said they believe that these allegations were manufactured drummed up an exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is\nCurrently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points to kind of mentioned that none of\nSo with the exception of one woman I'm Tasha morale who ultimately left the warehouse on and has become an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women were affiliated with the union at all so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all\nAnd you have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing to the Teamsters in a broader context which is they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so we and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm\nA pretty basic set of disputed facts so for instance we describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story as they age and window is\nThey ... the company disputed the description of windowless pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows\nIt has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't usually see sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nThere are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that those exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement\nI think you need and the credibility of denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than say\nYou know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on the floor\nWhen do I can see out into the whole way of our radio station but\nYes I I'm In a similar studio I can also see hot into a into a room where a man is working\nSo you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the legal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here in just a minute with both of you Jessica and leave but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their stories and if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma joined a year on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first son and um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't\nWell I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as it I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing was it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories as well as all my other things\nAnd all these other men were just sitting there and what I thought were like at least co workers like a friend level on that level\nIt it didn't prove to be and it just makes me so sad that actually I just saw that friend of mine and she's pregnant and she's now an attorney a title attorney and she's having the same problems and so it's still very relevant and I don't know if it's just oil and gas that good old boy kind of thing but\nI just really hope and pray that\nWell you know you see the day that men really want to look out for their women to just help us\nWill join can do the work [laughter] you know\nYeah Joanna thank you so much for your call and thank you for sharing your story let's get another story in here Erin is calling from Des Moines Iowa Aaron you're on the air\nHello Hi go ahead and I work for\nA media company and I work at nights and I live new shift for a newspaper and I'm throughout the years of the company I worked down to only one night a week and while I was pregnant with my first born I'm actually during while I was finding out the sex

had a special investigative series on this topic it was reported by\nJessica silver Greenberg ... joined us today from New York I'm also joined by Joan Williams she's a professor of law at the University of California Hastings and director of the center for work life law\nThere and let's go to the to the phones once again and take a call from me who's calling from Fort Mill South Carolina we you're on the air\n\nI I figured I could be the same token male I was a nurse or Fifteen Years working in a profession that is only three to four percent male bonding with three of the people that you've had speak each one of them on our beyond accommodation\nWhich for all of a disability he however temporary\nA plea for preferential treatment and on specifically talking about one of the ladies\nWho mentioned that people didn't understand she had children and that they assigned her shift that could have been assigned to the child was the single but that they didn't accommodate that she had children that goes way beyond any workplace accommodation\nI was also a paralegal for a decade and going workers' comp and injury\nIf there ... there is a lot of requests for understanding in a situation in which accommodating physical disability which is simply a simple ... part of being pregnant\nIs I've stood on floors and watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're having morning sickness or accommodating some you know hey they're gonna come get me when I was a male nurse 'cause like pick somebody up didn't matter just because she weighs Ninety eight pounds\nShe can't lift like I can get some of those are simple mhm when you start moving into it you shouldn't have to work nights they should go pick on the single people don't have children that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nLee I assure you actually in the end I I Want to turn your uh called back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um and Joe Millionaire turn this to you but at least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr and give me a second you just have to separate because I think it was the last time\nThat we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace so this is when a a UPS driver Peggy young doctors said she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because it put her at risk of miscarriage\nAh so she was told to stay home a meaning she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case went all the way to ... to the Supreme Court and in a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy and described what happened\nTo the doctor and got my restrictions and I turned out and and basically they said you know we don't provide light duty for paying a faith I'll tell you how long are pregnant\nI should say two dozen Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but Joe Williams my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent\nIn that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr it's a really interesting to see it and I think leaves call echoes a lot of what Justice Scalia said back then he he wrote for example that prohibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others have similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favorite employees\nThen it gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors they would have to offer show first pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age it would have to pay pensions\nTo workers who cannot work because of childbirth so he says it's implausible the current federal law\nWhich elsewhere creates a guarantee of equal treatment here alone creates a guaranteed a fever treatment what do you think about that\n[noise] um well that's not true I'm Lee does have a good point on it's not illegal but it's very bad practice um two Everytime you have an undesirable shift give it to somebody who's single doesn't have or it doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers\nOn and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes need to take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because of pregnancy need to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers to accommodate the person with diabetes often don't accommodate the person I'm with a with the pregnancy\nAnd blue collar context and they think about what Joanne said she said we can do the work I remember reading up one woman thing uh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what and when I was saying I'm often and blue collar contexts\nWomen can do the work but the employer my fence and reading hundreds of these cases\nIs um the employers didn't want to hire these women in the first place and so figures great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on the eve and fire them and that's what that young versus UPS decision a began to put an end to\n... not just because silver Greenberg and Natalie ... how there there have been attempts though since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgraded modernization of all laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers Fairness Act you know and that's been a kind of center piece of um efforts to strengthen the federal law filling the gaps that the that exist in the pregnancy discrimination act\nThere has been effort since so every congressional sessions twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced the pregnant workers Fairness Act so far in his not meeting\nMade it out of the um help committee which stands for how Sen labor and pensions I'm not going to get the exact terms right but um it's never had a hearing and um\n[noise] it has bipartisan support it now has bipartisan support I'm kind of not ironically but interestingly the chairman of that committee Lamar Alexander\nI'm his home state is um where ex PO or where that X. P. O. warehouses made so Tennessee\nAnd and so you but you're saying that it hasn't actually sort of advance to any new it hasn't never even advance to a voter debate\nIt's never been put on the floor and now it's your right it's never it's never had a a hearing\nOkay so Joan Williams let me just hop back to you here I mean is what you see uh in in in this proposal even if it's not going anywhere in Congress yet is it taking us in the right direction\nIt's taken us in the right direction and in fact something like twenty two states already have similar provisions there should be a national law that says um workers you're sometimes women women sometimes get pregnant and you have to accommodate them when they do\nOn the other hand I think it's really important to recognize that pregnant women already do have sweeping rights and they actually have rights even if the employer has accommodated nobody else\nI'm potentially under the Americans with Disabilities Act so any pregnant worker who was in a situation like this described in the article or listening on please go to pregnant at work to to ensure that you can exercise to legal rights that you have\nBecause pregnant workers already have a lot of rights under existing law that doesn't mean we don't need a new law because situation is very complicated to simplify it for employers and employees\nSo just getting Natalie though I Wonder I mean you spoke to so many women are in the process of reporting this story even with what Joan Williams just said that the ADA might cover a lot of women in in the accommodations they could need while pregnant\nI imagine that you rented to folks who were saying well I'm of hesitant to ask\nBecause of how my employer might see me I'm hesitant in terms of I don't want them to uh to reduce my pay or limit my future advancement or just that it would change sort of how they're seen in the workplace which then could have a future effects even after their children are born so\nRight so the women that we talk to 'em were overwhelmingly women who as you point out magna there in\nA jobs that they need desperately they're making close to minimum wage they have very little resources they are pregnant at the most vulnerable moment in their life they are sick\nMajor\nFunding for on point is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance

limited or ended the use of meat medium range or middle range land based nuclear missiles and we're speaking today with just ... he's president of Ploughshares Fund a foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution unless you're a little bit more uh from the president himself about why he wants to do this\nHere's President Trump after a rally in Elkhart County Nevada on Saturday telling reporters that he's ready to pull out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or as we've been taught calling it the IMF treaty\nTo develop but Russia to us in Chinatown was and they all got to do is they say let's really get smart let's none of us develop those weapons it Russia's knowing it kind of China's growing it anywhere it hearing today agreement\nSo president Donald Trump's they're saying that maybe we can and proliferation of Russia China and the U.S all come together and desire to stop it\nHere's national security adviser John Bolton during a press conference in Moscow yesterday where he met Russian President letter but I'm ... and both said there's just one point on which Russia and the U.S agreed that other countries with nuclear arsenal in the world\nAren't restricted by the IMF it's a bilateral agreement between the United states and Russia and that's a problem\nThere's a new strategic reality after this was a Cold War bilateral\nAs I think on this latter point of the four fascinated global ... a strategic environments for something that concerns the Russians for a very substantial and so we talked about\nJust ... how do you react to it you just heard John Bolton say\nJohn Bolton is on a mission to kill all arms control agreements he believes in the world of power and might\nA world of us dominance he believes that these kinds of treaties restrict military the military power the United states he wants a world where there are no restraints whatsoever on US military freedom of action he seems to have convinced\nA Donald Trump to ... to follow the course of action the fear of our allies the fear of many national security experts around the world and just you you take down this treaty which is working but just in place which is restricted the arms race in Europe than the next on his target list is the start treaty that had reduced\nOr the U.S and Soviet arsons in our Russian arsenals\nBy over fifty percent and if you take and that will then toppled that seems to be his goal and then you for the rest of the entire non proliferation\nTreaty regime in other words all the rules of the road that Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have built up over the last forty fifty years would come tumbling down and it's a a dog eat dog nuclear world that is a road instability and war\nSo I mean we have seen though for at least a year now that America's nuclear arsenal\nOr the ... for it to play a bigger role in the in the defense of the nation I mean I was looking at the the most recent nuclear posture review and it's\nAnd and it talks about these exact risks that that's a\n... of Russia of China of a non or a non a bilateral world here and that in order to counter or these other countries that are that are at hand thing and modernizing their nuclear arsenals that the Pentagon and the national Security Council say well the United states must do the same\nThing so I'm just wondering I mean earlier you you were saying that that stepping out are pulling out of the INS though you say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons isn't flight the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more\nThan the thousands of nuclear weapons are already have and in this case it did Bolton is pulling out an old trek he's he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with for ideological grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the the Russians who have modified and existing weapon to give a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites in European Russia and apparently in one of the site we're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we've been detecting Mrs about twenty fourteen\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently and arms control treated their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't repeal the burglary laws you enforce them\nBy repealing this treaty you're allowing putting to do whatever he wants now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want\nIn Europe and here's the the the really bad part\nIt's unlikely that we can match it\nOf course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country that wants them but no European ally wants them yes why you're seeing howls of complaint from France from\nFrom Germany from the European Union who warned that you're taking down and these are their words a pillar of European security no one needs\nAnd among among others that's what they're afraid of that Trump is fighting an arms race that was already brewing as both us and Russia are building other nuclear arms and now they're afraid to Europe but once again be the battleground for these two nuclear giants is a God all\nRight I mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's discomfort with the possibility of an end to the INS treaty I mean I'm seeing here the signal Gabriel who just stepped down in March as German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear madness I mean we should recall that a lot at one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry in Europe which is one of the things that led to a\nThe the INS to begin with that just wants you and I know you have a lot more to say but I Want to welcome in one more uh ... voice into this conversation Evelyn focused joins us now she joined us today from Washington She's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative Eurasia center and the ...

F. treaty itself and that by by you know deep sixteen the treaty you've lost what is perhaps the most effective\nMechanism to push back those intermediate range missiles or the that Russia you know as you said we've been talking about this twenty fourteen\nBut we were trying I mean we've been trying all along the only option we had now was depressed\nSupport for on point comes from WVU are Boston Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nAnd exact science is offering colon guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be used at home by prescription only information that color guard tests dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate Bertie we're talking about the Trump administration's signaling of its desire to pull out\nOf the intermediate nuclear forces treaty that we signed with Russia in Nineteen eighty seven and what effect that might have rent one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk and we're joined today by Evelyn ... she's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative\nAnd also served from two thousand twelve to two thousand Fifteen and the Obama administration as deputy assistant secretary of defense\nFor Russia Ukraine and Eurasia Joe certain cod joined us as well he's president of Ploughshares Fund a foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution and Evelyn and Joe if I may we've had a lot of patient colors waiting so let me just get to some of them right now Calvin is calling from Charleston, Missouri Calvin you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I Am or well\nAfrican American and um\nAs far as I'm us go as far as our our military and our nuclear arms and basically are on I think the way President Trump went about it is not necessarily the right way but I Do think he's going to go right the um as your first got there you know a lot of heat\nWe recall nation of the ... went to a lot of people for too long and a lot of things that President Trump has done has shown no food no longer\nTake this role on the global stage you all for it is all but instead of a nation that is for like lack of better words I think we've been a fleet\nIn the military and she says it's best to stay on guard all the way because when you fall asleep that really yearly attacks or break schools like Russia's do we I think he's doing the right thing we can be asleep I watched as far as our allies go it's our our ... we ...\nYou know right now I feel like we're behind the eight ball Russia's\nKelvin was taken back from there and thank you so much for your call let's go to Margaret who's calling from ... Virginia Margaret you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call I find the whole idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear a trainee buying and logical to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons oh this is going to make the world safer we already have more than seven thousand new believe\nAnd I don't see how the idea of increasing that number is going to make the world and they say are we have enough to destroy the world many times over already it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call Evelyn how would you like to respond to Margaret um well first to um ... and if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be from with our adversaries and I guess my thinking with\nRegard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now give the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt but that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and from these your enemies ... to ... Margaret's point I agree I mean I Do not think we should be wasting money on developing nuclear weapons that we don't need\nAnd that's the whole point of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is a ... also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother show on that\nJust sort of a new turn back to you here because of course uh we we could also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we will return to it but China has been lurking here uh a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the IMF here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... were the U.S has constrained by the ins and not able to deploy strategic weaponry in in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier because of this and that that's putting us\n... Kelvin term behind the eight ball in Asia\nYou always have to be very careful when you hear people who want new nuclear weapons in the language they use to John Bolton says you know we're out outmoded treaty violation ignored\nFeeling that we're be where the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us or as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons that is about ... or several hundred times more weapons and you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into the trap\nOf nuclear war planters his planners who who see this was some kind of board game where you have to match piece for peace so on China\nWhat they're talking about is that China a land power doesn't have much of a navy doesn't have much of a an air force or can reach beyond us borders they have new for now [laughter] okay for now they they they have\nA nuclear weapons or about about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to all seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like career like warm\nOr in like the United states and about forty that could reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us from building those but we have see based missile from reaching them just\nAre based weapons that can reach them fought just fine we have strategic submarines the crowd the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons ... that can hit them for every one that they have their can hit us we don't need to match 'em and here's the other off underlying realities there's\n... there's nobody you know one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said\nThat they do not want the U.S part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match your weapon\nWell everyone versus a ... I think the the deeper one of the deepest place that Joe is making here uh it's worthy of a sudden this discussion here for the discussion because\nIt and I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to just point that what there is no need for land based in intermediate range missiles when we have such a a overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use\nNo one wants us to use them but that that are there for a for U.S Strategic purposes in the Asia theater\nWell I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planner so I it's a little bit out of my\nLeague to say definitively that we don't need those weapons um I Will say however that it is true that\nOur president and I I wouldn't say members of his administration necessarily better president does speak of America is that for a declining power as if we're not the the strongest military power on the globe right now the strongest diplomatic power at least potentially were squandering that every day\nUm and of course still the strongest economic power so I Do think it's worth bearing in mind that we do have the upper hand and the reason the Russians are developing the capabilities that they're developing has to deal with the fact that they can't go head to head with us or the Chinese they have to develop asymmetric means\nAnd I think the real issue here has to do with Russia's\nFeeling of vulnerability the lack of what they call strategic stability in our defense relationship\nAnd their desire to do something to correct that and I think this administration needs to sit down and have some real blonde conversations with the Russians about the state of our defense relationship about the various dangerous asymmetric asymmetric things the Russians are doing\nMissiles not just these missiles that other missiles um like their cyber\nCapabilities the fact that they have inserted a box or other um cyber weapons into our energy grid that they could activate in time of war if necessary things like that are actually\nOf greater concern to me personally and I think should be the subject of serious discussion and then hopefully negotiation if the Russians are open to it\n\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auto

there was a special New York times investigative series that took a look into a incidences of some in some cases extreme incidences of alleged pregnancy discrimination and what happened and why\nThat series was co reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and ... and they they join us today and we also want to hear from\nFrom you do you think that a workplace accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask for combinations from your employer uh and got them or were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm\nHaving your work changed because of your pregnancy it might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your dismissal were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred and forty three talk also want to hear from employers about the situation from from your point of view\nIf you're an employer how much combination can you make and what are the realistic concerns and employers have about the limits too accommodating uh employees during pregnancy again what eight hundred for two or three to five five\nNow I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there if\nYou're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas and two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it and she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for her son\nWent back to her doctor and got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't accept your doctor's note because we have water I don't see it you have the water fountains available to you\nI was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of having this big deal and they read and scrutinizing my doctor I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested and listen to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you'd have to go\nThat's how they're Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen\nNow just because silver Greenberg and Natalie ... uh in the course of your reporting how did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you've found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt they had experience in the workplace while they were pregnant\nSo I think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common to experience was\nWhen you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the way that me too has and\nWe were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of very similar experiences from women all the way up and down the economic ladder and blue collar jobs in low wage jobs in office jobs for this most recent story on miscarriage\nI can say that ah we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis together um\nAnd uh we had\nTo in many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal and devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us\nYeah and and I imagine that the extreme difficulty that the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to the extreme difficulty with compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were there ... yeah\nExactly um so it was a paycheck and it was also health insurance and again just and I talk to people who were still working at the warehouse so these are folks who are at again great personal risk\nComing forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job\nRight now I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note um that uh the the warehouse company\nThat use that many of these women or all the women in their ... been your second story most of them where they work did the company not also said that the dispute the allegations because of uh currently though their attempts to unionize ah employees at the warehouse\n... yes I think they did say that they said that um they said they believe that these allegations were\nManufactured drummed up an exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is currently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points\nOf so with the exception of one woman\nI'm Tasha morale who ultimately left the warehouse 'em and has become an an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women were affiliated with the union at all and so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all\nAnd you have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing to the Teamsters in a broader context which is they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so\nWe and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm\nA pretty basic set of disputed fact so for instance we describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story as ... and window is\nThey just ... the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows it has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't ... sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nRight there are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that those exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement\nI think you need and the credibility of a denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than say\nYou know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on the floor\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now and there was an interior window I can see out into the whole way of our radio station but\nYes I I'm In a similar studio I also see hot into a into a room okay I'm In is working\nSo you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the legal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here and just a minute with both of you Jessica ... but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their stories and if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma joined a year on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first son and um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't\nWell I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as it's I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing was it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories as well as all my other things and all these other men were just sitting there and what I thought were like at least co workers like a friend level on that level\nIt it didn't prove to be and it just makes me so sad that actually I just saw that friend of mine and she's pregnant and she's now an attorney a title attorney and she is having the same problems and so it's still very relevant and I don't know if it's just oil and gas is a good old boy kind of thing but\nI just really hope and pray that\nWell you know you see the day that men really want to look out for their women to just help us\nWe'll do it and do the work [laughter] you know\nYeah Joanna thank you so much for your call a and thank you for sharing your story let's get another story in here Erin is calling from Des Moines Iowa Aaron you're on the air\nHello Hi go ahead and I work for a media company and I

a special investigative series on this topic it was reported by\nJessica silver Greenberg ... joined us today from New York I'm also joined by Joan Williams she's a professor of law at the University of California Hastings and director of the center for work life law\nThere and let's go to the to the phones once again and take a call from ... who's calling from Fort Mill South Carolina we're on the air\nI I figured I could be the same token male I was a nurse for Fifteen Years working in a profession that is only three to four percent male ... one of the three of the people that you've had speak each one of them on our beyond accommodation\nWhich sort of a disability however temporary to a plea for preferential treatment on specifically talking about one of the ladies who mentioned that people didn't understand she had children and the ...\nAnd to the child was the single but the they did an accommodate that she had children that goes way beyond any workplace accommodation I was also a paralegal for going workers' comp and then\nThere there's a lot of requests for understanding in a situation in which accommodating physical disability which is simple simple ... part of your partner\nIs I've stood on fours on watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're having morning it was or accommodating some you know they're going to come get me when I was a male nurse like pick somebody up didn't matter just because she weighs ... pounds\nShe can't lift like ... okay but some of those simple mhm when you start moving into it you shouldn't have to work nights this group pick on the single people don't have children that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nYeah Lee I assure you actually and and I I Want to turn your a call back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um and Joe Millionaire turn this to you but a least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr and give me a second you to set this up right because I think it was the last time or one of the more recent times that um that we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace so this is when a a UPS driver Peggy Young's doctors that she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because it put her at risk of miscarriage\nAh so she was told to stay home a meaning she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case when all the way it is up to the Supreme Court and in a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy and described what happened\nTo the doctor I got into it with my restrictions and I turned out and and basically they said you know we don't provide light of day for paying that faith I'll honk tell you how long are pregnant\nI should say in two thousand Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but Joe Williams my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent\nIn that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr some really interesting to see and I think leaves call echoes a lot of what Justice Scalia said back then he he wrote for example that prohibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others of similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favorite employees\nThen he gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors they would have to offer show first pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age it would have to pay pensions\nTo workers who cannot work becomes of child birth so it's he said it's implausible that current federal law\nWhich elsewhere create the guarantees of equal treatment here alone creates a guarantee of seabird treatment what do you think about that\nUm well that's not true I'm Lee does have a good point on it's not illegal but it's very bad practice on two Everytime you have an undesirable shift give it to somebody who's single doesn't have or doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers\nOn and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes needs to take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because it pregnancies needs to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers who will\nDon't accommodate the person I'm with a with a pregnancy\nAnd blue collar contacts and I think about what Joanne said she said we can do the work I remember reading a one woman saying oh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what Joanna saying I'm often and blue collar context\nWomen can do the work but the employer my sense and reading hundreds of these cases\nIs um the employer didn't want to hire these women and the first place and so the IRS great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on the eve and fire them and that's what the young versus UPS decision a began to put an end to\n... know Jessica silver Greenberg and not only to truth how there there have been attempts though since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgrade modernization of all laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers Fairness Act and that's been a kind of a centerpiece of um efforts to strengthen the federal law and filling the gaps that the that exist in the pregnancy discrimination act\nThere's been effort since so every congressional sessions since twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced the pregnant workers Fairness Act\nSo far it has not made it out of committee so it has not made it out of the\nUm help committee which stands for health than labor and pensions I'm not going to ... terms right but um it's never had a hearing and um it has bipartisan support\nIt now has bipartisan support I'm kind of not ironically but interestingly the chairman of that committee Lamar Alexander\nI'm
