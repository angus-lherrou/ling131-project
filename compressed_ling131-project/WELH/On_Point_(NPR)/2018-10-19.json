your take on it it is it a good movie\nYeah I mean I really really liked this movie I think one of the challenges for filmmakers who are making movies about really famous events that people watched on\nTV is to find a new angle into this story something that can resonate and surprise um the few whereas we're watching these very familiar events unfold and first men manages to do it by going through\nBasically Neil Armstrong's experience being part of the space mission and um how that links in with his personal life so bringing those two pieces together means that it's maybe a different take them people were expecting to see but it's also more personal and you know maybe you didn't expect to cry\nDuring a movie about the moon landing but um but I think a lot of people well\nYeah so

twenty Nineteen sixty nine and now there's a new movie out of that largely focused on Neil Armstrong and it's based on the book first men the life of Neil Armstrong which has been written by James Hansen he's a former NASA historian and professor emeritus of history at Auburn\nUniversity a professor hands and I just want to hear a little bit from Neil Armstrong himself here because it back in two thousand five\nHe gave an interview to sixty minutes I spoke with reporter at Bradley and Bradley had asked Armstrong in one point of this interview about the confidence that Armstrong portrayed when he gave a big thumbs up to assigned to the media shortly before um the Saturn five and the Apollo eleven mission took off\nYeah but it's a little bit of a sham of a mess you know the reality is a lot of times you get up in getting the costs if something goes wrong somewhere best house or actually [noise] when you have to lift off is really a big surprise [laughter]\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand and five a Jim Hansen\nYou ... you write in your book in the movie explores again who Neil Armstrong was as a man his character his demeanor and\nThere's a boom in the book where you write about uh why Armstrong was picked to be the first man to step on the moon and and not Buzz Aldrin and and if I got to have the ... if I had this right Chris craft to was the chief of flight operations in Houston said\nAh that Neal was Neal calm quiet and absolute confidence we all knew he was the Lindbergh type he had no ego meaning what\nWill they knew that that the ... the person who are not just commanded the Apollo and mission but more importantly in the sense of who was going to become this global like on the one who stepped out and represent demanded to use the first step onto another heavenly body\nBut this was going to be a big deal to him they imagined that correctly\nAnd uh there was a private meeting between Chris craft and ... corn and George Low who was one of the big officials in the manned space program in ... who was the director down in Houston it was a very private conversation in fact it's this is you don't find this in any records only an oral history coming from draft\n'em and and that was that they were having a discussion they knew this was going to be\nA big deal and uh you know to the public what they said was that the person going out for the asked Ron going out first would be based on really\nThe way the two astronauts were position inside the ... and that always was what NASA told the public and even told the astronauts as to the reason why they had ... and you'll go out first because the way that had to open it would be difficult for us to be the first one out\nBut in truth this you know this meeting was really what the decision was based on and that was\nA they knew that Neal was the type of personality that they felt would actually um you know could could serve as this icon I mean there was a lot of public public relations in a sense to what a you know NASA was doing with the Apollo program and they wanted the right kind of representative for\nFor this and so it was not just a statement about Armstrong a but it was also kind of a comment on the bus I mean they knew Buzz Aldrin quite well and they knew he was a very very professional astronaut\nBut they also knew that personality wise ... you know bus was quite a bit different than you know he was very extroverted he was\nYou know if he were there was an element of narcissism and buzz honestly\nUh and they are some commanders in fact when I interviewed Frank Borman who's the commander of Apollo eight\nWarm and made it very clear to me that he had told 'em Dix lightened that he would not accept buzz on his crew and it wasn't because he wasn't again on a profession astronaut though they were just elements of buses personality which were a little difficult\nAnd Neal can handle them a man and buzz and he worked together quite well but they just felt that if you know between these two men there was no question in their mind that Armstrong ... would be the perfect next ... a loon bird and buzz would be much more problematic\nWow interesting but let's step back in time considerably if we could I mean tell us about a Neil Armstrong's younger years they see here that did you first start flying at the age of six\nAnd he took us at first airplane ride laid right okay I was sick and got his pilot's license on the sixteenth birthday before he even\nTried to drive an automobile yet little interest in automobiles [laughter] which is kind of surprising for avoid back in that era but he had become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he bought he had his mommy saved every penny from everything you did\nTo buy 'em model airplanes that he built in in flight magazines have various kinds and uh\nAnd so it was really the passion for airplanes and flying you know in later after he becomes first man and becomes this iconic figure I'm some biographers or you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was\nYou know looked at the stars and big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that's true I mean you don't need to get interested in that so much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened was his career\nYou know he may as a pilot going to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu in Korea then becoming a test pilot he really led him to space was really not any you know Germany passion on his part as a as a boy that really just sort of the\nThe wave of technology in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night that he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying a or didn't fall but he was just hovering in his ...\nHe he did have that story and what was I think really a interesting about it was he was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who really you know um\nI mean there was a spiritual side to him but he wasn't the sort of person who who would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was\nCorinne dreaming so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because you you know he I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much of that you know uh so he was a very practical minded guy and and and even as a boy was type of was the type of proto engineer and we looked at things\nThat he was saying a profoundly go a goal oriented very ambitious because\nYou write about how you were saying this is a minute ago but it wasn't necessarily some sort of a passion for space in space actually don't necessarily that drove him but that all the great aviation accomplishments had already been done any kind of resented that and it was space that was the next step\nYeah that was a you know he he growing up in the thirties and they were still lots of first that were happening in terms of piloting an aviation\nAnd of course reading all those um flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great pioneering flights of that ... of the post or the pre World War two era any kind of thought as a boy well everybody's got those done and and now what's next [laughter]\nOf course he didn't realize that there are all sorts of things yet to calm\nYeah well so give me and said I Want to talk with you in some detail about an area of Neil Armstrong's life that the movie focuses on quite a bit and that's the death of his two year old\nA daughter Karen I'm so first of all let's let's just play a scene here from the movie first man you'll hear Ryan Gosling plays Neil Armstrong in in this scene he's asked about caring staff\nYou know I was sorry about your daughter\nI'm Sorry your question [noise]\nRight well I mean are you thinking will have an effect I think it would be\nUnreasonable that it wouldn't have some effect\nThe scene from the movie first man gave him the first of all tell us a little bit about uh Armstrong's daughter what happened to her\nWell may I say that in terms of that scene what I what really strikes me um two things struck me the most medals won the dressing or the screenwriter used verbatim a quote that I mean what Neal says in that scene\nA about being unreasonable to assume that would have no effect that comes directly from my interview with him back in early to thousands\nI because I asked him that specific question about did he think it had an effect on his flying in on his crew choices afterwards and that exactly as what he's already answered so of course I Love that scene which is exactly what Neal said\nThe other thing about seeing which I think it's relevant to your question is that no one I mean that question was not truly asked at his interview because no one there knew about it I mean the death of the child was so private\n[noise]\n[noise] support for on point comes from W.

it's the book upon which the new movie starring Ryan Gosling is based in that movie is also called\nFirst man and just before the break Jim Hansen was reminding us of of course those immortal words one small step for man one giant leap for mankind it that Neil Armstrong said when he first step foot on the moon in two thousand five or sixty minutes Armstrong explain what was going through his mind at the moment she said that those words\nI thought well when I step off I was just going to be a little steps as we step from their down to there but then I thought about all those four hundred thousand people that are given me the opportunity to make that staff and\nSo\nIt's going to be a big something for all those folks and indeed a lot of others that even were involved in the project so it was a kind of a simple correlation thoughts\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand five and how remarkably understated is he James Hansen saying yeah I kinda thought it was going to be something big for people who weren't even involved in that kind of a simple correlation I'd say it's humility they're out of ...\nDon't you love that phrase simple correlation I mean that that that comes from an engineer I think that\nBut uh yeah I mean as I said and one thing that I I get this question a lot you know did he come up with that phrase long before they landed meals answer always was that he you know there was some chance they weren't going to land I mean there were lots of things that had to go right before they actually could\nLand in why think about what you're going to say when you step out if you're not even going to do it so he you know he told me and he's told everyone you told everyone is whenever he was asked if he didn't really come up with the phrase until after they had landed and they had a few you know there were a few hours before they to get ready ensued up and\nAnd that that he composed it in his head while you know after the landing yeah very much\nTo say I mean it was supposed to say one stuff that\nSo what he did say into you know to his dying day that's what he thought and there's actually been a lot of the ... been done by different experts to see and I I was actually at the Smithsonian demonstration were NASA officials are in the new back in two thousand four I think it was\nIn and there was an Australian acoustics a guy who played a ... and he had evidence he thought\nThat in the electronic register of the the sound waves or that you could you saw something there that\nWas apparently an attempt to make the but there was an audible so I don't know I mean there's no way really I don't think to resolve this completely meal meals in the middle way told me said well just put you in parentheses\nWell Jim Henson hold on here for just a second because I have to say this this moment\nAh for those people who witnessed the launching of the Saturn ... rocket who saw those grainy TV images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin a walking on the moon and also by the way we should note Michael collins or as well\nUh orbiting around the moon alone has Armstrong and older and we're on the lunar surface it really left a as just a lasting impact on the millions of people\nWho remember it because something totally delightful happened to us this morning we uh got an email out of the blue from Maria lanes she's in Watertown, Massachusetts 'cause she had heard one of our our little promos that we were going to talk to you today about Neil Armstrong so Maria send us email out of the blue\nAlong with some pictures that she took in Hawaii when um\nWhen the Apollo eleven crew returned to earth and it's just such a wonderful story and that we've invited Maria to be on the show with us so she joins us now real welcome to on point\nI'm making a thank you so much it's it's my great pleasure it'd be with you\nIt is wonderful to have you and I want everyone to go to on point radio dot org and check out these photographs that Maria sent

commander of a large see one twenty four cargo plane and that was during Vietnam of course\nThe Vietnam War yeah ah so um we were we got word that the NASA mobile quarantine facility a streamlined trailer a would be traveling behind my uncle's house with the astronauts after they touched down in the ocean and were picked up by a ship\nUh-huh it's the pictures that you sent us a ... there's one in particular we we see you and your uncle standing there with with the uh the streamlined trailer going by and there's another photograph were Buzz Aldrin is in the window kinda waving at\nYou yes yes [laughter] and the feeling was you know that he was just overjoyed to be home I mean yeah it was a giant step for mankind and they actually returned from the moon\nYeah well so all these years later a Maria ... why is it to that you still feel such like a powerful residents to to that moment\nWell uh you know I'm Still astonished at the courage of the astronauts their families the ingenuity of the enormous team that made it all happened\nUh and it was some discussion about the movie and uh the book um and that they went up in the space capsule that looks like you know maybe a little bit\nSpaceships it looked like a ten tend to be perfectly honest [laughter]\nExactly exactly yeah so it's still so so moving and I'm so astonishing\nWell Maria lean from Watertown, Massachusetts a thank you so much for getting on the phone with us and thank you for sending us those remarkable photographs were going to share them with everyone who wants to see them on point radio dot org\nAgain

I really appreciate Margaret ... do you draw the connection between ah the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nWell I'm feels gross to talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking in discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what Jake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give 'em\nA really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and and and what is it are really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states or with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is the U.S getting played President Trump\nJared Kushner have put all of us really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi basking in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran\nOr who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nUh and uh it is this the right gambit\nAnd number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm trying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business well\nAh because to promote democratic ideals and to uh to try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also safe to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have order around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some\nSense of appropriate global behavior okay so uh why should every American care about that more than the economy or a more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that it will will impact negatively\nI mean we're Carlos how important we think this is geopolitical spaces journalistic basis moral basis very few people are going to vote on a hundred percent ... but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted ... American reporter for the guardian\nAnd pleaded guilty to that I Believe misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that uh\nHoping to tolerate happened from the hands of a a an ally it's from Saudi Arabia I'm not\nGoing to uh [noise]\nI'm just not in the position to make predictions about what the president's rhetoric the president's rhetoric in the United states uh it had caused this in any way or fuel is in any way but I Will say that um when when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay American journalists are concerned\nUniformly not just about the implications that has in the United states but about the implications that has another country's\nI'm I wanted to play you know we should turn to the midterms is coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here said that the tenor of what he has set in trying to rally the Republican faithful and the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia in Mississippi just in the past few weeks\nI'm not on the [noise] but I Am I\nVote for me I'm On the balance it out in twenty Eighteen because you are voting for me in twenty eight [noise]\nYou're voting for me but then again President Trump told the Associated Press and it makes sense of interview this week he went uh be to blame if the Republicans were to lose the house in November Jack Beatty is Donald Trump on the ballot even if his name isn't there or is he not\nHe certainly is and he was right the first time I'm you know when you look at the election step back they're really two elections going on one is in red states the senators and one swing districts the house members in the Senate it looks like the chancellor Republican chances according to\nA five thirty eight are four and five of holding the Senate and maybe even gaining some seats\nAre the Democrats only one in five on the other hand you're look at the house five and six chance that the Democrats will take the house one in six\nFor the for for the ... the Republicans holding on so that's quite remarkable for a sort of you know spread of two separate electorate two ... two kinds of elections going on and the elections are happening around the issue crucially of health care\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults

point I'm NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik I'm Talking about this past week in the news with Fernando bizarro he's the Washington correspondent for Univision Margaret ... senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg and on point news analyst Jack Beatty\nYou can join the conversation what stories caught your eye this week where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's one hundred forty three talked\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio a couple of listeners weighing in on line\nA Roger hunter at least a but listen posting on the name Roger Hunt posed a\nA that civility and the Democrats in the GOP is long gone the opposition is now the enemy hard to see a during these a midterm election season what could bring us together or another one speaking about the question of what we are expecting President Trump to do a notes\nSays it's worth noting the President Carter's disastrous legacy including a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow of the shah in Iran and its evolution to fifteenth century theocracy a as described\nThere a couple of listeners weighing in I wanted to turn to another element of the midterm elections which is the question of turnout and frankly turned out to Latino voters\nDemocrats talk about this a lot I think that in Texas they had been staking at the idea that ... or a rock would somehow benefit from that his\nHe has flew into a in Spanish appealing to Latino voters are are said to be even though a\nHis opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent ah Fernando bizarro how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that\nLatino turnout was very very low is twenty seven percent and twenty sixteen went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nFew um has a few research Hispanic trends came out this week with their\nWith numbers on the you know a vote this year they they are saying that there's a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered um it's it's been low or in talking about Texas there's a fight point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas Beto O'Rourke probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if\nCrew says uh appeal to two Latino Republicans in Texas is is is strong enough I'm interested in clay for instance the Univision just a interviewed a last week both candidates and and and ... did it as as always\nI'm Ted Cruz didn't um he he never likes to talk in Spanish and public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout it was going to beat it traditionally turns to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week was there a year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection um they'll let you know vote we might get a clearer picture than but but this again and we'll we'll dependable hands on on the turnout\nAh Fernando or they're in a couple of other races that you point to is that in which you think that's going to be politically important\nWhile we have Florida a and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um\nThe influx of Puerto Ricans in Florida and we tend to think about it I I think that conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nUh the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these\nPuerto Ricans I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case [laughter] there's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis in the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor I'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic you know the Latino bases well entrenched there there are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts\nThat are turning more democratic than than the than the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican have wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but\nBut it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor who young Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the mid term because numbers have shown that the rate is at what he said is not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take the change that his campaign done\nYou know six months before an election or by any one or two candidates it's going to take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort to get wealthy and those registered and then it turned out to vote a and until that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move and bought it\nMargaret ... seems to be that almost every cycle we hear the importance of Latino voters and the idea there's gonna be a surge but that there's a even if there is greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this\nI was really struck by one of your callers earlier actually laughed in the middle of the question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the ...\nDifferent narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know not everybody is asking the right questions which is it's a midterm year are the Republicans who voted for Trump still as enthusiastic are they going to go out and vote for their\nCongressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be one about young voters typically in the past is very low for young voters are they energize they say they're energized is actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I\nYou know I the the polling attempts to measure a snapshot in time but you could say something three weeks before\nAnd say you know and that's what the midterm question has always been so these questions are really important the president and many Republicans\nHave a I have at least been probably talking a good game about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and and I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans\nAre who have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a ... having a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all said and done come down to what individual people do um either for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day\nI Want to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... and I'm Andrea I lame on they spoke to CNN this week about why they're making that track from Honduras toward the United states\nThere's much corruption here in Honduras we want to work there is nothing we want them to plant bananas Len themes being there isn't any brother we need to migrate to another country brother in the hospitals there is no security there is nothing or patients die brother\nWere heading to the United states we're going to arrive with Donald Trump he has to receive us\nA you heard there the voices of those migrants speaking through interpreters on on on CNN a Fernando bizarro a vis a caravan it's obviously intended to create a tension or what are the repercussions of it well the repercussions\nCan be many obviously we could have a second family separation policy as it was a suggested by the administration or and reported last week that they are considering it in New policy in which in a way that they would give somewhat of a\nVoluntary separation option to these families once they were detained but this is ... mostly right now in the works we we still do not know the details of this but if I may give some some context to this care of and I think there are some politics involved I mean you interview I've seen many of the interviews that people that are coming up and there is a true need\nTheir people escaping to people looking for better jobs are people looking for safety people who have been threatened um there's violence in the in the countries of the northern triangle which are an Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador [laughter]\nBut I Want to give some context of this this this caravan left some better Sula Honduras\nIt day after last Saturday it

how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I always went to NPs or not in the ... school and Milwaukee because that's where I live when I started a as a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame for me going from\nBeing around people all day who look and talk just like me now coming here to people who look completely different than the and had different lingo and different things than I have so\nI remember my freshman year I Would still talk like

in your own life where you you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburban I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks them how you have to act as a completely different and so because of the areas where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because um\nIt's like you because you are black\nSaying these words and acting like this makes you appear as hood and makes you appear as less educated than somebody else so when you're around these people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both of my\nMostly white communities and mostly populated with well actually it it is the way I spoke the way I talked with a dress that way I act it was completely different side that somebody can relate to the idea of code switching\n... how much like how much of an extra burden

taking my call Yes sir I'm I'll get I'll give credit and\nUh fifty eight year old black man and this one wants to know in America and I don't think it a ... bad effect that seemed like it got worse the Seventy to be honest with you\nWhat's gotten worse and Michael ... the the racial profiling and the tension between races I mean\nLook we got we got Donald Trump ... that's the the attitude and the mentality of where the state of mind you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws in check and everything and that little towel tea and psychological profile is still on the leaf off today\nThank you so much for your perspective Michael I appreciate it very much dimitrius downward you focus a lot in your group as I understand it on thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's there's a line in in the movie where star Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically\n... he's in her corner but a certain point he says to you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that how do you approach thinking about uh how how you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face\nUm I think there's a respect we need to respect for both both sides um when I was Thirteen I had to\nExperience will stop and frisk and that put me to have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like fear for police can you tell me about can reach us can you tell me a little bit about what that incident was like oh it was like what happened it was scary I was walking around my block\nAnd I was going to build into building trying to find a friend and then do it like these two policemen and following me so I started like kind of walking fast because that was kind of scary and um they called me around the corner and they started to check my ankle to see if I had drugs or anything and\nI had twenty dollars because at my parents and having to pockets and I was just shaking the whole time and they say well you're scared I was like\nThis never happened to me before so the next two years every time I caught like Cruz by me I always like shake up though do\nYeah I mean it you know look I live in New York and a half for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among the people who make policies in laws about stop and frisk\nYou know is about this issue but it kind of takes away from the human element right like this you acted not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nIn the same neighborhood for years so he started growing relationships with them and just not have a new police or say every month or week like we just started growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and he has the same idea and we're like we have a conversation sometimes and think\nThat that should happen they should have place police officers and the same neighborhood\nAnd there had been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has been a ... you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood majors yes yeah\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a Jeremiah Harvey he's a nine year old\nWho is a falsely accused of sexual assault or I Believe in Brooklyn New York uh when his backpack brushed up against a woman in the corner store or the woman Theresa Klein is white she called the police and has since apologized but your mind his mother told good morning America that lake lake dimitrius they can't shake the incident\nSo high because of how\nTo play on my mind\nHow can I Can't think of his house in the world\nAre you concerned that this has permanently scarred Jeremiah yes I certainly and it was devastated by hand because even after\n[noise] you know patrol cars on Flatbush Avenue and saying mommy are they he had to take you away from us\nCaroline's how much uh uh is this idea of living while black uh uh uh we've heard instances where\nA man was stopped from entering his own home or apartment building in St Louis because a white resident there didn't trust him although he would there as well how much does this affect your your daily rhythms of your life\nI think it affects me heavily because it it creates this constant fear that you walk around and you carry it creates when you when you drive you look out of your near you see a police officer here and even though you're doing everything right you immediately think what am I doing wrong\nAnd I'm just to add on listening to the video and the incident with the little boy it very much reminding me of the situation with him at two\nAnd how that affected him he Emmett Till had no idea what he had done wrong and nodded to the little boy that it just happened to and\nThey now he feels as if he did something wrong he feels as if he made a mistake or that you know something bad is going to happen to him at such a young age and now he's going to grow up and have that carrying around him so just\nGrowing up black and living up living in this type of situation create a constant\nUm amount of fear on you in a constant amount of worry anxiety and she got to carry around because you just never know what it's going to happen or what a small move is gonna um how ... what was going to affect you it affect your life in the long run so\nIn the movie that he gives ... as I said earlier played by among western string bird is a ... attends a mostly white school called Williamson prepped after her friend ... was killed in a traffic stop by a police officer some students take the opportunity to school and to go to a protest\nIn this clip that we'll hear star reviews her friend Haley who's played by Sabrina Carpenter\nI just don't know who he is the situation as an excuse to skip class how far it's not just in his class it's a good cause all happened to be a really ...\nReally don't want to hear messenger space that I knew\nYour school how would you guys called book talk on the heat you give up what kinds of conversations with your white classmates that spark any any new thoughts\nUm actually I had two of them one of my freshman year and then one maybe last week the first one that I have my freshman class actually did sparked a conversation about\nWhat happened but it wasn't a I'm a growing conversation and it was more so like my teacher talking and then people just kind of like one of the conversation to be over\nAnd then the one that I recently had um last week was kind of the same thing so none of them really sparked the major conversations um\nBased on what my teacher said to my classmates responding they just kind of made it awkward for me on my end because I noticed that actually was reading the book and talking about the situation everybody was kind of looking at me because I'm the only black student in the class\nAnd I'm In my school I've known for talking about\nActivism and police brutality so it just kind of both times kind of gave everyone kind of gave me the side and it didn't really bring up any heavy conversation so\nSo what what hopes do you have for the movie and that is\nI really hope that after watching the movie people understand the frustration that we have because there's a lot of people in my school and a lot of people that I Know in general who um I have a best friend and she is really big on activism as well um and people look at us and they tell\nDramatic that police officers are good that the person who was shot and killed she had done whatever they did um that people now justifies a reason to die\nPeople tell us that were being over dramatic or that we're over thinking it or we need to let it go but I really hope that after seeing this movie and actually seeing this happens and seeing that happen and seeing 'em the aftermath of the situation not only on star\nOn her community out that thing that will allow them to understand exactly how we feel and I want them to be able to\n\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auditor insurance coverage for cars tracks or SUV and providing twenty four

I really appreciate Margaret ... do you draw the connection between uh the presidents remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nWell um it feels gross and talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking and discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what Jake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give 'em\nA really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue in and and and what is it really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states or with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is the U.S getting played President Trump Jared Kushner have put all of us really almost all of their eggs into this added\nOr who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with uh and uh it is this the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm\nTrying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business wealth or because to promote democratic ideals and to um\nTo try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also safe to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have order around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some\nSense of appropriate global behavior okay so uh why should every American care about that more than the economy or a more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that uh it will will impact them negatively\nI mean ... how important we think this is a geopolitical basis journalistic basis a moral basis very few people are going to vote on that are sent ... but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted ... American reporter for the guardian\nAnd pleaded guilty to that I Believe misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that\nAre and what he's counting singer seemingly kind of hoping to tolerate happened from the hands of a a\nAn ally it from Saudi Arabia I'm not going to\nUh [noise] I'm just trying to position to make predictions about what the president's rhetoric the president's rhetoric in the United states\nUh it has caused this in any way or fuel is in any way but I Will say that um when when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay American journalists are concerned uniformly not just about the implications that has the United states but about the implications that has another country's\nUm I Won a plate you know we should turn to the midterms is coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here that the the tenor of what he has said in trying to rally the Republican faithful and the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia and Mississippi just in the past few weeks\nI'm not on the [noise] but I Am I\nVote for me I Want you to send them on the balance it out in twenty Eighteen

if the Republicans were to lose the house in November Jack Beatty is Donald Trump on the ballot even if his name isn't there or is he not\nYou certainly is and he was right the first time I'm you know when you look at the election step factor really true elections going on one is in red states the senators and one swing districts the house members in the Senate it looks like the ... the Republican chances according to\nA five thirty eight are four and five of holding the Senate and maybe even gaining some seats\nAre the Democrats only one in five on the other hand you look at the house five and

... senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg and on point news analyst Jack Beatty you can join the conversation what stories caught your eye this week where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five ... hundred and forty three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio a couple of listeners weighing in on line\nA Roger hunter at least a but listen posting on the name Roger ... post ah ah that civility and the Democrats and the GOP is long gone the opposition is now the enemy hard to see during these a midterm election season what could bring us together\nOr another one speaking about the question of what we are expecting President Trump to do a notes\nSays it's worth noting the President Carter's disastrous legacy including a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow the shot in Iran and its devil Lucian to fifteenth century theocracy a as described there a couple of listeners weighing in\nWhich is the question of turnout and particularly turnout Latino voters Democrats talk about this a lot I think are in Texas they'd been staking at the idea that ... would somehow benefit from that his he is flew into a in Spanish appealing to Latino voters are are are said to be even though a\nHis opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent ah Fernando bizarro how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that\nTeen Latino turnout was very very lowest twenty seven percent than twenty sixteen went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nA few um as a pure research Hispanic trends came out this week with their\nWith numbers on that too you know a vote this year they they are saying that there's a record or they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered um it's it's been low of ... talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas Beto O'Rourke probably needs that but you know it's just it's really hard to to define a if\nCrew says uh appeal to two Latino Republicans in Texas is is is strong enough um interestingly for instance Univision just a interviewed a last week both candidates and\nAnd and ... did it as as oh he always does with Spanish language media didn't in Spanish or Ted Cruz didn't um he he never likes to talk in Spanish and public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout it was going to be traditionally it tends to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week would there a year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection um they'll let you know vote we might get a clearer picture than but that this again and we'll we'll dependable hands on on the turnout ah Fernando or they're\nIn a couple of other races that you would point to is that in which you think that's going to be particularly important\nWhile we have Florida a and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um\nThe influx of Puerto Ricans in Florida and we tend to think about it I think that conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria and all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have ... I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly on the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nUh the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these\nPuerto Ricans I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case [laughter] there's been a at a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis on the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor I'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic\nYou know the the Latino bases well entrenched there that are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic then\nThen the then the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican have wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but\nBut it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference\nOn Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor Julian Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the mid term because numbers have shown that the rate is at what he said it's not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take the change that his campaign done or six months before an election or by any one or two candidates it's going to take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort to get wealthy and those registered and then it turned out to vote a\n... and until that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move a lot of\nMargaret television seems to be that almost every cycle we hear the importance of Latino voters and the idea there's gonna be a surge but that there's a even if there is greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this\nI was really struck by one of your callers earlier actually left in the middle of the question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the ... of\nDifferent narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know not everybody is asking the right questions which is it's a midterm year are the Republicans who voted for Trump still as enthusiastic are they going to go out and vote for their\nCongressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be one about young voters typically\nIn the past is very low for young voters are they energize they say they're
