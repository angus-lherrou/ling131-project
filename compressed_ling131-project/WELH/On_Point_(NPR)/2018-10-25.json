Nevada on Saturday telling reporters that he's ready to pull out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or as we've been taught calling it the IMF treaty\nWith Russia China was and they all got to do is they say let's really get smart let's none of us develop those lessons that Russia's doing it and if China is doing it and we're hearing today agreement that's unacceptable\nSo president Donald Trump they're saying that maybe we can and proliferation of Russia China and the U.S all come together and desire to stop it\nHere's national security adviser John Bolton during a press conference in Moscow yesterday where he met Russian President letter but I'm ... and both said there's just one point on which Russia and the U.S agreed that other countries with nuclear arsenal in the world\nAren't restricted by the IMF it's a bilateral agreement between the United states and Russia and that's a problem\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral ballistic missile related treaty in a multi polar world I think on this latter point of the more\nFascinated global a strategic environments for something that concerns the Russians a very substantial and we talked about that\nJust ... how do you react to what you just heard John Bolton say\nJohn Bolton is on a mission to kill all arms control agreements he believes in the world of power and might\nOr a world of us dominance he believes that these kinds of treaties restrict military the military power the United states he wants to world where there were no restraints whatsoever on US military freedom of action he seems to have convinced\nA Donald Trump to ... to follow the course of action the fear of our allies the fear of many national security experts around the world and just you you take down this treaty which is working which is in place which is restricted the arms race in Europe than the next on his target list is the start treaty that had reduced\nOr the U.S and Soviet arsons are rushing arsenals by over fifty percent and if you take and that will bend\nFor the rest of the entire non proliferation treaty regime in other words all the rules of the road that Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have built up over the last forty fifty years would come tumbling down and it's a a dog eat dog nuclear world well that is a road instability and war\nSo I mean we have seen though uh for at least a year now that America's nuclear arsenal\nUm the ... for it to play a bigger role in the in the defense of the nation I mean I was looking at the the most recent nuclear posture review and it's\nAnd and it talks about these exact risk that that are made of Russia of China of a non or a non a bilateral world here and that in order to counter or these other countries that are\nThat are at hand singing modernizing their nuclear arsenals that the Pentagon and the national Security Council say well the United states must do the same\nThing so I'm just wondering I mean earlier you you were saying that that stepping out are pulling out of the INS though you say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand that how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons is inflate the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more\nThan the thousands of nuclear weapons are already have and in this case the Bolton is pulling out an old trek he's he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with for ideological grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the the Russians who have modified and existing weapon to give it a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites and European Russia and apparently in one of the site we're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we'd been detecting since about twenty fourteen\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently and arms control treaty their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't repeal the burglary laws you enforce them\nBy repealing this treaty you're allowing ... to do whatever he wants now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want in Europe and here's the the the really bad part it's unlikely that we can match it\nOf course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country that wants to them but no European ally wants them yes why you're seeing how of complaint\nFrom France from from Germany from the European Union who warned that you're taking down and these are their words a pillar of European security no one needs a new arms race says the foreign minister of the European Union\nAre among among others that's what they were afraid of that Trump is citing an arms race that was already brewing as both the U.S and Russia are building other nuclear arms and now they're afraid that Europe but once again be the battleground\nFor these two nuclear giants as they battle\nI mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's discomfort with the possibility of an end to the INS treaty I mean I'm seeing here that stigma Gabriel who just stepped down a in March as German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear madness I mean we should recall that a lot at one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry and

Kelvin this term behind the eight ball in Asia\nYou always have to be very careful when you hear people who are in ... new nuclear weapons and the language they use so John Bolton says\nYou know what I'll outmoded treaty violation ignored were constrained and so you know it feeds into that feeling that we're be where the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nThat is to about ... uh several hundred times more weapons than you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into the trap\nOf nuclear war planters planners who who see this was some kind of board game where you have to match for peace so on China\nWhat they're talking about is that China or a land power doesn't have much of an navy doesn't have much of a an air force that can reach beyond us borders they have new for now [laughter] okay for now they they they have\nA nuclear weapons are up about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like real like won\nA and like the United states and about forty to reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capabilities\nYou know where the treaty stops us from building those beliefs you based missile reaching them just\nAre based weapons that can reach them fought just fine we have strategic submarines proud the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons ... that can have them for every one they have the can hit us we don't need to match them and here's the other off underline reality there's ...\nNobody you know one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said that\nThey do not want us to part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match up\nWell everyone farce is a ... I think the the deeper one of the deepest points that Joe is making here uh it's worthy of of some of this discussion here for the discussion because ... and I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to Joe's point that what there is no need for land based I'm intermediate range missiles when we have such a a overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use\nNo one wants us to use them but that that are there for a for U.S Strategic purposes in the Asia theater\n[noise] well I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planner so I it's a little bit out of my\nLeague to say definitively that we don't need those weapons um I Will say however that it is true that\nOur president and I I wouldn't say members of his administration necessarily better president does speak of America is that for a declining power as if we're not the the strongest military power on the globe right now the strongest diplomatic power at least potentially were squandering that every day\nUm and of course still the strongest economic power so I Do think it's worth bearing in mind that we do have the upper hand and the reason the Russians are developing the capabilities that they're developing has to do with the fact that they can't go head to head with us or the Chinese they have to develop asymmetric means\nAnd I think the real issue here has to do with Russia's\nFeeling of vulnerability the lack of what they call strategic stability in our defense relationship\nAnd their desire to do something to correct that and I think this administration needs to sit down and have some real\nBlonde conversations with the Russians about the state of our defense relationship about the various dangerous asymmetric asymmetric things the Russians are doing to try to get an edge on us like developing missiles not just these missiles but other missiles um like their cyber\nCapabilities the fact that they have inserted a boss or other um cyber weapons into our energy grid that they could activate in time of war if necessary\nThings like that are actually of greater concern to me personally and I think should be the subject of serious discussion and then hopefully negotiation if the Russians are open to it\nYeah so let me ask you a quick question before we move away from China are entirely here because uh back in two thousand eleven John Bolton wrote to co authored a a a column or not but I should say in the wall Street Journal\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are SUVs and providing twenty four sat in customer service more information on auto insurance at ... dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nFrom WVU are Boston and NPR I'm making a chocolate party this is on point Saudi Arabia public prosecutor is now saying that the ...\nHe did act former Florida Senator Bob Graham has been watching the Saudi king them closely\nAnd the co chair of the nine eleven commission says that the U.S has placate the Saudi royal family for too long and that Washington has played an assertive role in covering up Saudi bad behavior will talk to him also on the show today will have the latest on the virus causing polio like symptoms it hit at least twenty states that's all coming up next on point\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington on corporate Coleman additional suspicious packages have been found today in New York City and in Delaware and want to Delaware was addressed a former Democratic vice president Joe Biden the one in New York was sent a liberal activist and actor Robert Deniro\nBoth are similar to several others suspicious packages sent to democratic officials are supporters of this week\nNew York state governor Andrew Cuomo told NPR's MORNING EDITION investigations are underway\nTo have the actual Begich who sent the packages fingerprints on the pay\nA postal inspection inspecting the devices themselves then you have a second level of investigation what his motivation\nPresident Trump is also set a robust federal investigation is underway this morning he tweeted that some of the anger in the U.S is the fault of the media he demanded that the media quote must clean up its act fast exclamation point\nGeorgia election officials have until noon today to file a response to a judge's order to accept absentee ballots with questionable signatures from member station WBUR a bee in Atlanta ...

investigation into the nine eleven attacks he's been watching Saudi Arabia for almost Twenty years now and he's saying that it's time for Washington to really stop coddling\nThe Saudi kingdom where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five side of the eight hundred forty three talk a Senator Graham I Hope you can forgive me that I had to cut you off there before the break because um\nYou're telling us is very interesting story about a Saudi couple a young Saudi couple in Sarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now if I if I'm reading the reporting around this correctly\nThat they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers\nUh and his license plate information was were on file 'em in the office of this gated community indicated maybe he'd been coming in and out\nAnd that leader on the FBI Tampa office had actually compiled of late the reporter the with\nConnections between the hijackers and this family but with the FBI give you that report you\nKnow uh and after attempting to get access to the report we uh\nWe which was a journalist and myself a ... ... ... filed a freedom of Information Act\nOr to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have any information on the three of flight students and the Saudi family or the judge rejected that as being a on\nBelievable or they even said that uh they uh had a uh a few documents a and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily or directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages of information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven\nSurvey of the situation in Sarasota\nOf with the judge then to determine what which of those eighty thousand pages could be made public\nA it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen or and after six years the judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand\nPages of can be made available to the American public okay\nSenator name I Want us take a step back here though because the ... you write to those ... eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of a Florida federal judge\nEighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota not yet made available to the public in any way shape or form but even before or the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the those pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask\nAnd did you you had to even go to the FBI is central record keeping office to even see some of some of these reports and that uh and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nOh I Would say the FBI was being quite a on a cooperative in fact I'm at one point a shortly after the\nSituation Sarasota was discovered uh my wife and I were a in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with our second daughter third daughter ah and ah we were intercepted at a\nLogan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there are an essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI or that we're wasting our time and that I should\nA shot up and go oh you were the hair of\nThe nine eleven commission and the and the number two person at the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow the lead about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers I mean it it almost ... belief that as\nWell and it gets it gets worse um so I uh\nI said I told the deputy director of the the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so I did\nUh and uh the when I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have a had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again\nI was wasting my time uh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI on the Sarasota a ... situation\nCenter [noise] nine eleven [noise]\nYou know we were Seventeen years out and\nAnybody who was alive and remembers that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and\nAnd I'm hearing you tell me that the FBI as late as two thousand eleven was actively try to dissuade you from a you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and and and you said before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within its possession information it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening\nWell uh the mystery is a over three administrations why has there been this uh\nUh reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they wanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nAre raised the possibility that another nation state uh was responsible ran counter to that narrative uh the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had run in two thousand eight in large part on his opposition to the war in Iraq and had raised questions about the ...\nThat Saudi Arabia and why it wasn't more\nIn ... fighter that nothing was done in his administration or to expedite the release of information\nOn nine eleven and now a President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darn wings of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president or has been very Folsom in his ah statements of\nApproval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no uh\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven\nYeah and I'm going to take a couple of quick calls here senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official reports so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this not um that no one no official report saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean would you go so far as to say that you have seen\nAgain in your time is co chairs nine eleven a commissioner that you've seen evidence or documentation or something anything that ties the Saudi royal family itself to something like nine eleven\nYes I mean I think the twenty eight pages you've already cited the one situation where prince band or who is the ambassador Saudi Arabia to the United states or was involved in financing a persons who played a critical role in\nUh nine eleven [noise] [noise]\nWell let's go to a caller here Charlie is calling from New Orleans Louisiana Charlie you're on the air\nI like all like each other to grab a bite question is do the

neurology and your therapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern medical center\nIs also an expert in treating rare autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system and he's already treated eight patients with acute ... uh my latest this year Dr Greenberg welcome to implant\nThank you might not happy to be here so first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to to science we've seen it before\nYou're correct and the the facts are also we are are are part of the issue relative to some confusion so when\nWe talk about a ... mile light of it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults\nAre there are multiple ways to damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen every other year in the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with\nThis type of a condition of ... and the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that that's an intro virus it is that's the suspicion or the ... viruses are a group of viruses that\nPause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild uh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an enter a virus and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold\nAnd then in very rare situations certain enter of viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing these I'm quite worrying headlines about polio like symptoms or in some children who are being infected with this and you say that and we started started seeing a spike beginning in two thousand four teams so\nUh but to enter the virus wasn't wasn't leading can be seen symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated acute ... patients\nAnd when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference between\nTwo thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognize so and that\nThe symptoms syndrome a looks essentially like polio ... which\nWas described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about the polio virus as the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states\nThe syndrome of polio ... which look almost identical or with a few unique features between them\nThe polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but we think are there have been a background of rare paralytic events mainland kids happening for several decades\nBut something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen\nAnd so that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nHow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern\nOr where we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes a for these ah outbreaks in the late summer early fall and\nWhat's notable is the the virus that has received the most attention um which was within the family of inner of viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus in any of these cases when testing has been done\nIn a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay so this is where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I said earlier that\nThese enter the viruses are also very common and ... and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but it but if they're still kind of I don't know that there's no current vaccine for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there\nA correct there is no are available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay um are we are just\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation so that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine we're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for\nAnd so we're our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus among researchers in public health officials that we think we have the right culprit and\nIt turns out that ah the virus or family viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy\nAnd so often will have children who have the syndrome of ... test negative\nBased on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for but it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um\nWhen we would test the spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating in their spinal cord and causing damage and affecting the nerves that control the muscles we can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus or to find\nAnd so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so if you have a child with paralysis and you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus\nWe don't look to the spinal cord to spinal fluid because we can't find it we have to look elsewhere in the body\nAnd so we're trying to sort out the same process to use for the center of ours is now the the reassuring part of this relative to the history of polio virus is\nIn the world of polio virus back in the Nineteen thirties the Nineteen forties when we had tens of thousands of children being paralyzed by this virus\nWas that for every hundred to every thousand people who would get infected with this virus somebody would become paralyzed and so it's it's virulence its ability to invade and damage the spinal cord was quite high\nThe best estimates for the enter a virus that we're most concerned about is that it's maybe one in a hundred thousand infection\nSo very very low rate that very low rate and so we are be we're trying to be very reassuring to\nUh all of the families and parents out there and I'm I'm a father I have two daughters and one of them has a cold right now and I have to remind myself a that overwhelmingly the odds are she is not going to suffer a neurologic

I mean the everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right route Amazon warehouses are not like that um\n... when he mentioned I'm working in Israel one of the best stories and came across in the last couple of years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in his company and I'm Talking about like what do we come and even the BCS I call to that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise]\nAnyway but yeah there are there is a lot of just hoping stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well and he let me just ask you briefly a are we\n... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we\n... are we over waiting the influence of these like the old for big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's because he was saying that he not obviously not every company is going this way is is are there actually maybe medium or a smaller size or come tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on and said\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and not very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and you know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the better with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much but at the same time\nProductivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and African\nRight now it's like ... because I mean because we knowledge work the asset is the worst ... if not workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of just the standard way of looking at labor is that's that's the lover that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down most quickly in order to to\nBut for that quarter I just cut a workforce to go to church you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of the company or the workers themselves so\nMy question you new to you and ... is that in trying to shift perspective a little here um for for these tech companies or for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowered them or a ... that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nYeah I think it has to has to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and attention ... kind of a two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male chimp as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps so they never raised any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it\nTo me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing those start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share it's a private company um but they share a all of their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nAh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build it more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they're the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for the company an unhealthy for the people working there for\n'em and then I'd also say like a again to companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate in the success of that company as well so everyone has invested in the successive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top I think there's a lot to be said about having those\nMore flexible schedules and um you know enabling remote work I Know from my team or or just a multiple teams because they run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bulls and we plan those together for oh it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by the time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like such as long as we're getting a yeah hit the gold on how you have your life\nNow now a there are a lot more calls you want to get to hear but then ... which is not from you and what you're hearing from India\nOh you ... we we totally agree and and um there's a a another company called Base Camp that are just in Chicago and software company and I I'm I'm sort of detecting a few common threads with with the other companies that you're talking about any and and that is one we just have never\nWith hyper growth are growing

one eight hundred and four to three eight to five side of the eight hundred for two three talk\nA Senator Graham I Hope you can forgive me that I had to cut you off there before the break because um you're telling us it's very interesting story about a Saudi couple a young Saudi couple in Sarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now if\nI if I'm reading the reporting around this correctly that they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers a ... and his license plate information was were on file 'em in the office of this gated community indicated it maybe he'd been coming in and out\nAnd that leader on the FBI Tampa office had actually compiled of late the reporter the with\nConnections between the hijackers and this family but with the FBI give you that report\nNo uh and after attempting to get access to the report we uh\nWe which was a journalist and myself a ... ... ... filed a freedom of Information Act or to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have it\nA flight students are and the Saudi family or the judge rejected that as being a on\nBelievable uh they've in said that uh they\nUh had a a few documents a and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily ... um directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages of information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven\nSurvey of the situation in Sarasota\nOf with the judge then to determine what which of those ... eighty thousand pages could be made public\nA it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen or and after six years the judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand\nPages are can be made available to the American public okay\nSenator name I Want to stay to step back here though because of the ... year right to those eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of the Florida federal judge eighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota\nNot yet made available to the public in any way shape or form\nBut even before or the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the those pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask for some of the reports at least um and did you you had to even go to the FBI is central record keeping office to even see\nSome of some of these reports and that a ... and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nOh I Would say the FBI was being quite a on a cooperative in fact I'm at one point a shortly after the\nSituation in Sarasota was discovered uh my wife and I were a in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with our second daughter third daughter ah and ah we were intercepted at a\nLogan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there are and essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI or that we were wasting our time and that I should\nUh shut up and go oh you were the hair of\nThe nine eleven commission and the and the number two person at the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow elite about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers it it it almost ... belief that are\nWell and it gets it gets worse um so I uh\nI said I told the deputy director that the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so I did\nUh and uh the when I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have a had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again\nI was wasting my time uh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI on the Sarasota a ... situation\nCenter [noise] nine eleven [noise] you know we were Seventeen\nWas alive and remembers that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and\nAnd I'm hearing you tell me that the FBI as late as two thousand eleven was actively trying to dissuade you from a you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and ... and you said before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within its possession information it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening\nWell uh the mystery is a over three administrations why has there been this uh\nUh reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they wanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nUh raised the possibility that another nation state uh was responsible ran counter to that narrative uh the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had run in two thousand eight in large part on his opposition to the war in Iraq and had raised questions about the ...\nThat Saudi Arabia and why it was a more a focus of attention\nBut uh in ... fighter that nothing was done in his administration or to expedite the release of information on nine eleven and now a President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darn wings of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president has been very Folsom in his ah statements of\nApproval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no of\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven\nYeah and I'm going to take a couple of quick calls here senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official report so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this thought um that no one no official report saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean would you go so far as to say that you have seen\nAgain in your time is coach as nine eleven a commissioner that you've seen evidence or documentation or something anything that ties the Saudi royal family itself to something like nine eleven\nYes I mean I think the twenty eight pages you've already cited the one situation where prints band or who is the ambassador Saudi Arabia to the United states or was involved in

nervous system and he's already treated eight patients with acute slash ... uh my latest this year definitely leaned Burt welcome to implant\nThank you might not happy to be here so first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to science we've seen it before\nYou're correct and the the facts are also lead to our part of the issue relative to some confusion so\nWhen we talk about acute flat said my light of it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults\nAre there are multiple ways to damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen\nEvery other year in the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with\nThis type of a condition of ... and the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that that's an intro virus\nIt is that's the suspicion or the enter a viruses are a group of viruses\nThat are very common uh usually cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild uh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an enter a virus and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold\nAnd then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing these I'm quite worrying headlines about polio like symptoms\nOr in some children who are being infected with this and you say that um we started started seeing a spike beginning in in two thousand four teams so uh but to enter the virus wasn't wasn't leading to the same symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated acute ... patients\nAnd when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference between\nTwo thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognized and\nThat the symptoms of syndrome a looks essentially like polio ... which\nWas described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about the polio virus as the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states\nThe syndrome of polio ... which look almost identical or with a few unique features between them\nThe polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but we think are there have been a background of rare paralytic events mainly in case\nSomething has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen\nAnd so that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nHow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern\nWhere we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes a for these ah outbreaks in the late summer early fall and\nWhat's notable is the the virus that has received the most attention um which is within the family of inner of viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus in any of these cases when testing has been done\nIn a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay this is where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I said earlier that\nThese enter the viruses are also very common and ... and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but it but if they're still kind of I don't know that there's no current vaccines for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there a\nCorrect there is no uh available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay um our researchers wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path and developing line\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation\nSo that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine we're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for in a show where our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus\nAmong researchers in public health officials that we think we have the right culprit and\nIt turns out that ah the virus or family viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy and so often will have children who have the syndrome of ... negative\nBased on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for\nBut it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um\nWhen we would test the spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating their spinal cord and causing damage and affecting the nerves that control the muscles we can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus or to find\nAnd so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so if you have a child with paralysis in you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus\nWe don't look to the final quarter the spinal fluid because we can't find that we have to look elsewhere in the body and so we're trying to sort out the same process to use for the center of ours is now that the reassuring part of this\nRelative to the history of polio virus is in the world of polio virus back in the Nineteen thirties and Nineteen forties when we had tens of thousands of children being paralyzed by this virus\nWas that for every hundred to every thousand people who would get infected with this virus\nIt's it's virulence its ability to invade and damage the spinal cord was quite hard the best estimates for the center of ours that we're most concerned about is that it's maybe one in a hundred thousand infection\nSo very a very low rate then\nVery low rate and so we are be we're trying to be very reassuring to uh all of the families and parents out there and I'm On a father of two daughters and one of them has a cold right now and I have to remind oneself ah that
