she's talking with us this hour from Savannah Georgia and you can join us we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five this eight hundred\nFor two three talk what is your question for America's most preeminent a costume designer who was telling the visual stories of African Americans on film through the fabric\nThat she puts her actors and actresses and again we're at eight hundred forty three eight to five five\nA roof Carter let me ask you could just jump back in time deep back in time here because I\nRead a in a previous interview that you gave that um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume design is that right\nYes um when I was a younger uh say junior high school and through high school my mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker was a free counseling service for the city\nAnd people could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew people you know\nUm there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and so we would ride with her through um you know downtown or down go to ... or drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh in point or hide\nYou know hide in the back seat\nAnd my mom would say you know he looks okay he's gotta clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause and it's kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know some time she would even role that window down to our dismay and say you\nKnow ... how George you know how are you today\nAnd you know that kind of a view of you know people is what I still used today to kind of embrace a individuality and that it helps with increasing costs\nAnd you know just taking it all in\nYeah because it from the occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly perjury should know there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the world of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film\nThat's essentially what you're doing right you're telling me and told portions of each character is a story or and so now they want to communicate that to the world constructed in that film and then to us as viewers\nYes I feel that costume design or can be just to find his story telling design and you when people want to associate costume design with fashion\nAnd you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but\nThe overall a I'm a goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear\nRight so so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm ... in Hollywood I mean well let me just ask let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done one Fifteen plus collaborations with him and\nYes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter] um I met spike\nLee in Los Angeles a friend who's a casting director now Robbie read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for and it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of my friends and\nI I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all you know wanted to hang out together and we did and he\nKept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance in theater and that's where my sights set so I kept you know modeling around him I had this idea of getting film experience and he suggested\nThat I call us see or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student thesis project and he said that would give me experience with being on a set and what that medium um would be like you know\nAnd so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday\nI was on the USC student film or doing the costumes well\nAnd then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and\nDo the right thing so I Want to play a clip well not all day I was actually the first one and then do the right then do it they're okay I wouldn't be sure to Spike Lee fans out there like get your fill longer iffy right leg [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing it's such an amazing movie is elected as day so I wouldn't want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is a scene where you're going to hear a John\nJohn Carlos DeVito who plays bugging out and he asked so the owner of the local pizzeria played by debt halo or why they're only pictures of white celebrities on the wall of his pizza shop\nIs going to war or brothers on Wall Street Journal which would you\nGet a bunch of brothers a lot of these shows and use your stepfather stepmother whoever wants to see what this is my history American Pie is all you\nDo stuff for [noise]\n... wants to be any American leakers laughable so since we last month we do have set\nA scene from Spike Lee is Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer\nUh on that one of many collaborations she had was likely that the thing about this film a ruse if I may say is that it really\nOne of many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality of what the characters are where like the high tops the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how does that play out in your design\nWell it was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a\nA clothing or during that time and\nA guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and we really wanted to represent you know pop culture of the moment and really create this um this intensity of color in their environment\nAnd so what we did was we created like top side of\nAfrican fabrics and you see bugging out wearing can take cloth shorts that we made and\nIt was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really hot that stuff will go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and\nSo because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of the color and\nAnd the styles that um we present to kind of all the fed into the combination of what eventually happened story\nWell uh we've got a lot of callers who want to ask you some questions raised so if I may turn to them to be a delight we were talking with Ruthie Carter she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer uh she got those nominations for Malcolm X and um it started but those are two of the forty plus films that she's been a costume designer on\nThen that means we double checked [laughter]\nAnd I'm wanting more television projects I your group and again congratulations to you for that but we're the one eight hundred forty three eight to five five eight hundred and forty three talk so let's go to Tanya who's calling from Detroit Michigan Tanya you're on the air\nHi Mack now and\nFor on point comes from exact science is offering colder guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home\nPrescription only information at color guard test dot com and Geico offering motorcycle and RV insurance more information available on motorcycle and RV insurance at ... dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker ... we are talking today with Ruth e card or she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer she got those non for Malcolm X. in on this died at her most recent work you've seen it it's in Black Panther she's also done the costume designer for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what love got to do with it and Selma as well and I wanted to just play a quick clip\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of Reverend Dr Martin Luther king in ... twenty fourteen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and peel striped tie and a style ink black over ...\nI don't want it for [noise]\nCosts don't want to [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I Can't stand it but showed\nUp [laughter] [noise]\nSeeing from the two thousand fourteen film Selma Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you were doing a film or depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who is playing Dr King well there are\nSeveral images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king there's several books pictorial books that had been written and\nSo the little nuances of his character where where I delved into the design um one or is that I'm a Martin Luther king was a ... bust men and ... if you look at it\nA little fleshy area around the color of his neck where he buttoned his shirt and it would kind of roll over the top\nAnd David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is he gained weight for the role um and I wanted to sort of\nHelp that along and I made his assure callers so at least smaller than what we what would be required so that I can also see that little neck role that happened I'm at the collar of king shirt I Love that detail [laughter] it's not something I Would have ever\nNotice to but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying\nA character yeah and the costume has to support the actor there has to help support their performance and\nI'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction of the colors during that time now to David ... colors were too tight um he never ... and I would say he never complained\nUm maybe it just felt\nRight right for him and ah when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk coast with your questions for the Carter and how she tells he's African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\nI met ... an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about this when I thought Black Panther in the theater I was just blown away not only by the film but also by its potential as a teaching opportunity\nI met future who's been working on a project on how we can use textiles and clothing to teach science technology engineering and math topics\nAnd I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate here of opportunities we can't we don't just send you know right now just sense to\nYou know being a robotics team or something like that but they could learn three D. print things they could talk about textiles with\nSpecial technology in them like the black Panthers suit the stores kinetic energy well what kinds of other energy could you put into a fabric how would you do it they're just so many opportunities here and it was so exciting\nSarah thank you for your cold Ruthie of a response\nFor yes um what I Love about Sherry's lab\nIs that it's a a it's an exploration and what kids can do you never can hunters estimate what your children to can do\nAnd she's certainly does represent that you know she I imagined was the mastermind behind the three D. printing up the queen's crown and her shoulder mantle she created the black Panthers suit and\nAnd I think it's just a great opportunity to use it as a vehicle for for learning ...\nA ruse if I may want to talk for a minute or two or hear from you or for a couple of minutes about ... in particular one of the films that you received an Oscar nomination for for your costume design there of course that's the Steven Spielberg film\nI'm about uh about a revolt honestly on a Spanish slave ship and so we have a scene here again the films Nineteen Ninety seven and you're going to hear the leader of the slave revolt Josephine cave\nDo who stands up uh during the mutiny trial he's put on trial for his labor of old and repeatedly cries for his freedom\nOr for reasons for for the fun to kind of disrupt these proceedings which I\nWas [noise]\nCry all or\n\n[noise]\nA scene from the Nineteen Ninety seven film I'm is not that scene where the leader of the slave revolt justice in case put on trial Carter if I remember correctly in that scene a sink is wearing a western clothes right\nYes ah the abolitionist\nI and the reading we read that the abolition escape from clothing to the Africans and\nThere was an account that said in the courtroom\nThey look like I'm sitting in the gallery and so I use those words to create um\nClothing that was donated especially forcing K who would have been given closing from the attorneys that were supporting the case and I also wanted to present him in a royal manner um very regal at this moment where he says give us free\nAnd you'll notice that um the African sitting there and the gallery are mostly in these white bill Louis shirts up the period and I wanted to evoke the feeling of dubbed\nHuh now is it also us maybe I was reading this wrong because I I I thought the part of the reason why\nThe slightly baggy fit uh on on Joseph was as you said like he had to wear borrowed close um and that's a so that they didn't quite fit properly but nevertheless gave as you're saying is this regal feel to him\nYes yes and that was the ... the parrot period was a very below we pleaded ruffled shirt\nYeah and and this is a particularly interesting film to talk about because I'm ... and you also did the costume design for white royalty on the phone\nUp um yes John Adams yeah and you know based on you know art history I looked at the composition of some of the great painters and\nAlso the history of the court case of the ... and all those things are important to paint the picture of royalty and the African says you know when they\nFirst embark in Mystic Connecticut they are wearing blanket and\nAnd I looked at the cargo list on the ... ship and saw that they were carrying wool and linens and leather", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "01"}
