you decide you in your tribute to to talk so expressly and and directly about her or her addiction itself\nYou know it honestly didn't even occur to me not to talk about that\nLike I said it was part of what defined her adult life it didn't define her but it defined a lot of how she lived her life she was you know in the times that she was in sobriety she was struggling to stay there and when she wasn't in sobriety she was living in a lot of darkness so I wanted her\nObituary to reflect both the love and the light that she brought into the world and also the darkness that she and so many

conversation what do you find works\nMedication assisted treatment abstinence only and twelve step programs where white hundred for two three eight to five five hundred forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string of Detroit for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon do pose the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a cheap to pose a youth are called this one of the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have a department of health right where either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide it's the number one source of accidental death in our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs\nThere are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and urges the human body for heroin and fentanyl are that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said you've been orphaned methadone there's a lot of stigma around um\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable and otherwise I won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we can take a deep breath and we could move forward so\nAh what the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at our needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment but you wanted to try some of the medication\nOr you'll get a prescription for it and that prescription is written by a doctor or a doctor who lost a son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose instead of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a preschool\nAppointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot and we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place\nThat mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner or in our prison system who needs it and I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post incarcerate of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year in overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of the ... percent eight percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things are and hopefully they'll turn the tide\nI'm Keane O'Neill with this of helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean\nI Believe it would ... than incarcerated multiple times I never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think Burlington is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issues so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue in a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an abstinence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm cheap to political will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about absence base which is another way of describing some things like twelve steps you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean 'cause in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to get them on a good path or it's it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know I'm Brandon just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family were not he was first starting to get clean had the idea well\nIf you're taking methadone or if you're taking the pornography and while you're not really create clean you're not silver right which is just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat\nThis disease and so denying people access or making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you if you have an issue where you have diabetes we don't say to people you know what like\nYou can't have this drought that would help you get better and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think it's hard to\nBelieve that like if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what good is saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we are headed\nFor or mitigate a disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically if you look at the public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduced uh the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town in the Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict I used to play\nWork he said Brandon I've been on ... for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um\nIf you just look at the success rates if anybody's spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there's no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality\nIs a losing proposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life you know we've been getting fasting\nAnd strong response from listeners or as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not she used to have either he posted on our website or she's on her Facebook page\nAnd and wrote addiction is a lifelong bite of a disease that few respect relies can't be cured by jailer combination only love respect understanding and radical forgiveness and patients can cure it or another comment on our website or under the name nearest nine wrote I've had a cute chronic pain for over ten years opioids have kept me alive\nThey're the only reason I haven't killed myself do the endless horrible pain these drugs keep it at least at the level where I can read watch TV et cetera and get some website I've tried so many non drug treatments and non opioid drugs\nBut uh nothing or have helped I I Will point out that we do have a information on sites for dealing with addiction and also questions of dealing with a cell farmers suicidal thoughts on our website at one point\nOr radio you can Google for that I Want to take a call now from Norwich, Connecticut\nAre now dear uh go ahead please\nOr how you doing today okay let me thank you for having me on on the other guy the other gentleman just said this kind of threw me off because you cannot put somebody who has diabetes\nLike my grandmother had for twenty five years in the same category as someone who ... who will have the ... ... I mean\nThere's ... there's ... on ... of course there's more than one way with people end up getting hooked on these things a lot of times that happens I'm your accident across it and they're given a prescription and after the fact that end up becoming addicted to their medication some people which either they don't need to take the medication and what we're paying\nAs someone who do continue to need to take the medication for pay my for my personal experience alone in ten years a bit of knowledge I lost about nine people who do the kids right All right out of high school some of them none of the movie to see Thirty years old you know it's just a shame because there's so many layers to this\nIt's not just if that's true for I mean there's a whole there's a whole thing going on with the insurance is a strange companies\n[noise] support for on pulling comes from Geico hovering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and runners insurance through the Geico insurance agency additional information can be found a guy go dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nAnd sending working to make higher education more affordable with the same day Joe unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand he textbooks online homework access codes\nAnd study guns send gauge unlimited C.

South Carolina thanks for joining us\nHi thank you for taking my call uh-huh I wanted to hear a little bit I'm Sorry I just want to hear what your thoughts were about all this\nI'm I'm a recovering addict and I think an addict ever is here because I think for men were hard wired differently than normal people you know our one Tylenol and they get for somebody at five would be great for me um I went from\nI hated thank medicine until I had um oral surgery and they gave me ... all of a sudden I wasn't allowed I thought this was happening I kidney stand there and they gave me I think ... um and\nAnd that was even better I was like God heaven and are you know and then they and they turn English back out into the prescription and then that's it you know and then you're you're out there on your eye on what your body aiming for more of what you can't yet and you'll do just about anything you can to get what you need\nMhm thank you for that jaded we've also had a call from Boston, Massachusetts Tom you're on the air go ahead\nBarry how you're doing okay I think the police chief from Vermont is right on but I I I got to tell you if a a drug company to providing the medicated assisted medication or pushing that drug\nUh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem and because the medication is effect of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years and I've never seen anything like what a few over the last\nYou know the the pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back from the pharmaceuticals the front and all their ... a flooded throughout the addiction to heroin belt in Massachusetts anyway and so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people\nThat are stabilized on a on a medication\nAnd then what happens is that there are off and then they relapse died because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat way to get a shot up front and all of a they get the uh a perk thirty that are that are really a ... you know and they got a couple of them and they guy now and my history I was incarcerated because of my opiates or the conduct\nAnd uh I relapsed that day I got out had been read today I'd be dead because of twenty percent of the population that are regularly proven that have a addictive um a heroine a history die within the first ah two weeks because of an overdose so\nWe're talking with Tom let me let me what the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing boost your personal experience and also your expertise on this but maybe I won't let you weigh in on a couple of things first you've heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how they are a an active part of the solution\nConstructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not a currently part of the problem or how does that a fit in with your reporting on this\n[noise] well um\nIt sits in in that um you know they've just uh have plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make a difference in America they could do as\nChief don't pose a and others in some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose death rates by a very little bit\nAnd make it widely available one of the things I wanted to point out by what about the chief in what's happening in Vermont is that's really unusual I mean my ... is just off to him\nBut in states where are we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently\nI mean we have we have a ... you're talking you're talking about Medicaid expansion right yeah ... I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion I mean we have waiting lists that range from three weeks to two years to get into MIT program we have no funneling from our ERs into MIT programs\nI'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange so nowhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails\nAnd um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live\nOr whether you get this lifesaving treatment or not\nBut we we have a a a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis reflection of American culture to seize of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans\nIn your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the constriction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in Appalachia\nOr you know stretching from you know the American\nSouth east up to the northeast a ... in industries where they could rely and steady jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is a vital sign was being pushed ... what we really need our policies to address the root causes which are mental health\nIt's fair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers asked them in middle school what do you want to be when he grows when you grow up and he says I Want to be a draw or she goes oh you want to be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around him in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard it's hard to central at ... opioids were prescribe three hundred six hundred percent that the\n... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nAnd recently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex aides are said the U.S is starting to turn the corner on this epidemic or he cited figure showing a to point eight percent dip in over deaths from September twenty seventeenth of march twenty Eighteen according\nTo provisional data from the CDC the seemingly relentless trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be benefiting in the right direction\nPlus telling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but the concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn the tide\nRendell pose a you know the number of Americans dying from a ... a related deaths appears to be a just under the number of Americans in total he died in the Vietnam War but ... is the secretary right are we turning the corner of it on this well\nFirst of all there that's every year rights of the Vietnam War was the ten year war and to you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so\nI think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for America to fix it spiritual Malaysia before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we are being derelict in their duties and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders that want to wrestle with\nUnemployment and A People's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like marijuana burger here in Burlington or a chief of police um you know get down to brass tacks there are things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and\nUh I'd like to think bad for being so candid about them as well I mean it's getting the right treatment out there it's getting medication to the people who need\nThe medication the Twenty one day apps and in space detox is called the spin dry by a lot of the people addicted to opioids in Vermont because you just go for your Twenty one day ... and what it does is it gets the judge off your back and get your mom off your back\nAnd then you just go quietly back to your home and you start using opioids again that is not about hope and despair in America that's about sound public health policies\nThat can you just take one moment and describe for us what opioids just briefly what opioids due to the brain why are they so dangerous\nYeah so um once you get addicted to these drugs it's it's people I mean I watch over and over and my book people lose\nUm access to these lifesaving treatments and they are just not able to uh get better without the help of this medication assisted treatment because of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "27"}
