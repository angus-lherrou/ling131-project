talking with the actor and comedian Eli Kemper about her new memoir flights world days will touch on the comedic topics and tougher ones including beams of surviving trauma in workplace harassment and think a little bit about the ways we learn from ah sitcoms\nIn their handling of burning issues here right across from me in Studio here in New York City is of course the principal Eli Kemper Emmy nominated started a Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt right there you heard the show's theme song A L e a\nCan be Schmidt it was a ... as you say in your book and rightly so it is\nFreezing pitch of a series or just you know the two sentences tell us the set up of of of what can be Schmidt is and how she writes in her ... ... ... ... you know ... where she is when she arrives at a ... it's\nInsane so she said the the backstory of ... that she was kidnapped when she was fourteen years old\nI'm held underground in a bunker for Fifteen Years and then rescued by the FBI or where she is a brought back into the world and decides to make a new start for herself and of course New York city\nThat's we start so I mean it it gets a little crazier from there but I mean it ... um\nI certainly thought when I heard the idea for the show that someone somewhere was ... because that doesn't seem like a sitcom to me\nNo I mean it seems it seems like the set up for an extremely tough tough drama that's you know you could imagine HBO ... you know the guys who did the wire doing this very differently absolutely\nAnd yet it at at Robert car like and Tina Fey made it into a an extremely funny show [laughter]\nSo tell me about that because what you you know it's it's a it's a the sets did your outfits like everything is incredibly bright almost pastel right yeah and you could not be ... you know you as you mentioned earlier of a temper as a ... character yet but you could not be basically a more default sunny\nReactor I Love that about ... because she is sort of unabashedly girl what she wears bright pink pastel pants much too might like LA's ... because I don't I don't like to think that\nThat were frightening that she was floral shirts you were jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and ... at at the same time she is this\nSomething to think of all and I'm so difficult that I Can't actually\nImagine what that must have been like\nAnd yet she continues to choose to think the best in people and that it's mysterious to me I don't know if you're born with that\nSort of tenacity or or if you have a a forced to develop it during you know at a test like the one she was put through but um I think it's I think it's remarkable and and she's such she's an admirable beyond admirable person\nAlso very childish yeah\nUh you know in the way she deals with people in season one of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt a roommate and friend Titus a tries to give her a good by hug on the first day of school sci\nFi best if you're a Titus uneducated at all the\nOut some day when you're gay black man you have accumulated received like this [noise]\n[laughter]\nTruly truly funny a and you know\nIn Deering and loving of the same time there's an undercurrent of bleak it in all this stuff how do you how do you look at this rather dark comedy with such cheerful this\nI don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject of as very serious as the one\nUm that can meet the the torture that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because bad stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it is in the writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think it's ... it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just [noise]\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know fine and sunny one moment and then horrible and a kind of ... the next and and you have to navigate those times so that it was that I went abroad answer McCullough it reflects life but it does\nWell so you just obsolete show created by Tina Fey moved on initially for NBC Weaver was as a Robert Greenwald who's the head of entertainment I guess he was like this is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful foot soldiers to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about this right I\nI Do and I I thankfully don't know the conversations that took place so I I get to plead ignorance but um yes it was originally slated to be on NBC and again it you know I think it\nSpeaks to the discomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl who's been underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus is sending her off school can she didn't get to complete high school friend there's something very adolescent or immature about her I mean what where would you be if you'd been held up bugs ... twelve or something\nYou know I'm alarmed because sometimes when McKinney doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people in two thousand Eighteen behave I'm like oh I didn't know that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not only was not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I should have gone on Instagram before you honestly honestly I Swear she's I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think that she is necessarily naive because about certain things because she has been her her adolescence was stunted its its Arrested Development and she's coming out um as a [noise]\nTwenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life no big deal I don't think you are but she is she's you know\nI she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nA lot of ways you guys sort of ...

NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik we are talking with comedian and Emmy nominated actor Eli temper about her new memoir my squirrel days we're going to be talking coming minutes about her presence and made a crop of really strong women in comedy names come to mind among others Tina Fey ... polar ... killing\n... started the Netflix Original series ... with me the studio thanks for being with ... thank you for having ... so I just want to pick up on something that we were talking about uh uh during the break uh which is where's the line you guys joke about me to you guys make clear her feminine uh you know can be Schmitz feminist wire\nYou know and also yet you have hurt these are the comedians do fits almost backing into being a complete sexual harassed her the workplace\nUm how do you joke about something that's so serious\nI don't have the answer and ... and the ... been struggling with them and sort of wondering about that every day because\nUh it does seem like so much it's changing and comedy and I'm ... you would never wanted ... little anyone's concerned and so I don't know I don't know where is the line between making a joke and making a at an observation and so\nUm I think it's it um it's a it's an enlightening time and it's a powerful time because ... ladies are feeling a comfortable and secure and coming forward and and ... revealing what has happened to them and there's nothing more powerful than owning a truth like that\nAnd I I don't know ... you know it's it's jokes that I think you could have made ...\nYear ago or two years ago art are no longer funny and so trying to figure that out is good or bad for you I I mean luckily a lot of my humor does not go into like you know ...\nOn that that kind of material so I I I'm up by that I mean like I'm not known for like my fence it boiled comedy but I I think that it is when writing the book I was I was very ... editor and I were very concerned with how\nAnd I again I wasn't writing a lot about like um [noise] uh uh subjects that were enormously sensitive but at the same time something that you might just think oh I'm just rattling off a little joke it might not be\nSurprised when is it like Michael Jordan who's like look I don't get involved political stuff because Republicans or buy sneakers just like Democrats or basketball fans to or is it that you actually that's not where do you want to speak publicly you just want to be sort of apart from from\nFrom that stuff to things yes I Am the Michael Jordan comedy yes I think that's very your icon on the logo [laughter]\nThank you for recognizing natural and second [noise] yeah I mean it it does seem like a a cop out I mean if you you can't not be involved in politics now I mean I I don't mean you have to you can't not be political now it's too crazy and\nA momentous a time so I think you can't just say well I'm not going to get involved\nBut I also think that a lot of people are talking to and with people who already agree with them so I I don't know how much um I don't know how much to weigh in on that because\nThere are in some ways like the last question on this I Want to ask is you know do you think that can be Schmidt ultimately in the way I handled this in addition to getting less in addition to make sure that humor was pointed out can be a you know advance certain understanding of certain issues on this stuff or do you think that it's hey we're here to make people laugh even if it's in a funny circumstance and that's what we're here to do\nI think there was definitely a feminist I'm a ... an intention when when especially when writing this season for and again I'm not in the writers and so I don't want to speak for them but I\nKnow I don't think it was just about trying to me I mean that's what's so insane to me and why these guys are magicians is because they're able to uh make these points\nUm both political and some of the points while also keeping like jokes that are pristine and just so sharp and funny in in the show at the same time but I ... I Would no I I think it's too crazy a time to avoid that\nWe played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids which itself was\nReally funny at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... uh apparently you said you shared a questions about women in comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch weight text talk them yet when he fourteen you took on the question that you said that you've been asked not just by fans by reporters and the question was are women funny\nFunny yes\nSome women are funny\nAren't funny I [noise] it's it's similar to how some women are tall [noise]\nAnd you know some women are short\nIf I had been like to ride the train well others prefer to take the U.S we are different\n[laughter] they are ... apparently the women are different from one another as what you're saying as well as from from the\nRight I think that women are different from one is in that in that I ... I Am talking about women are all sorts of different things and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\n[noise] so but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know a meta question from reporters standards you know on these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions right so hopefully some of them was muted than others\nBut I I think that if someone bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know for reporters have a conference on what happens but everyone does that is like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women\nAnd I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay are so women can be funny but I have ... being honest\nI think it was based on the box office success of bridesmaids that that a demonstrated studios that you can make\nA a very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny is so stupid because it what are you talking about yeah they've always been funny\nWhen you went after a delay Christopher Hitchens who knows the noted British an intentional controversial as we actually wrote this thing for vanity fair's or essentially obviously women are not fun and they don't need to be a was that something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in in the two thousands would that's still a thing\nI never encountered that and I know some women have an ... an improv I think and I said it did a less of it are citizens brigade theater and the people's improv eater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from when I have encountered that it's from um [noise]\nListen it's from white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from uh some people I went to college with who who work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed at the movie it was funny and I thought I get out of my inbox because I don't know what's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised\nMe me furious because but I I you know it but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think which is that there's it's not an issue if someone is in a sketch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funny or they're not\nTo send our backs and congrats on the fact that apparently white guys can sometimes make money [laughter] sometimes you work with some real giants here as we mentioned you work with Tina Fey admitted killing a Christian wig\nA oh what did you what did you what do you take from working with somebody like Tina Fey who really has sort of I think public we tried to articulate how she's tried to model things for women comedians would be like you know you got to be tough to stand up for what you believe what did you take from working with her\n... what you just said which is on most of my um most of the I guess I Would say lessons I learned from you know if I were just by watching her because that woman lead by example and she doesn't complain and she works tirelessly and and and she treats everyone fairly and kindly\nAnd she's very grounded so I think that there is um\nShe empowers women by doing she just she she's she talks about it but she also just does it and so\nLike when you walk us through what that means a little bit for listeners who may not a folder as closely she well\nI guess it means that it's not it's not like it's a constant thing like\nI mean she says listen I've read bossy pants Fifteen times I mean it's it's really not so into her best selling book which is just brilliant and she talks about this in her book being the boss and I there's so\nThere's something in her introduction where she says\nThat she gets asked a lot like what's it like being in charge of all those people and she compares it to she says oh it's like it must be like when people ask Donald Trump hey how's it feel to be in charge of this is before Donald Trump was president by the way and and her point being that nobody's asking Donald Trump that although\nPeople should be asking a question about 'em is because you think people are now I think people are saying [laughter] it's every show different book on but but the fact that she would be asked that question I think it was so perplexing because you just a double standard there and I I I'm", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "06"}
