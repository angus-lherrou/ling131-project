CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs\nAnd also in Washington is ... he's national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics a and everyone you can imagine there's a lot of people who already wanna uh tell us what they think and and what they have to say about the Kavanaugh confirmations so I'm just going to get a couple of calls in here let's go to William who's calling from Berkeley Michigan you're on the air William\nHow are you doing well how are you\n... thank you um\nYeah you know the the the whole process was disturbing aren't gonna odd independence swinging mostly the Democrat lost my wife and I and I tell you it there's just so much negativity and what steel like a\nIt's just constant constant negative energy that I'm I'm I'm following the red levels lever this time\nYou're going to vote Republican in the midterms\nYes yes and I and and I and that's the goal you know I was with you it besides a few ... a year and there I've ever done that before now oh hey it's it's it's really amazing how ah I'll just all the thing that you're back and forth to just to just to back it\nAll right William thank you so much for your call let's go to Kathleen who's calling from Dayton, Ohio Kathleen you're on the air\nHi hey good morning things that I mean sorry [laughter] thanks for taking my call ah anyway I I I was shocked that center caused quite frankly because you know she clearly she voted like in a\nI'm Sorry ETT an arrogant privileged sexist old white Republican man and how Republicans couldn't be concerned about\nKavanaugh prior to the sexual assault up you know claims you know based on you know the questions lay he asked him about lying you know under oath and and and receiving a stolen emails and and then we have all these uh\nA law professor that across the country coming out against him and and a former justice but here's how I got my weekend which I'd already been doing I went down into the some of the poorest neighborhoods in Dayton, Ohio on quitting many street on little street old industrial a parts in Dayton where\nI Am familiar with the neighborhoods for fifty years ago\nAnd now these areas or you know where it was white\nMan you know mostly white a middle class or being able to work in the manufacturing plant the downtown dating and now it's very poor Hispanic black whites and the majority of the homes are either in shambles or boarded off so\nCan I Know ... or ... I'm Sorry to jump in here but but are you telling me that like your your\nYou got it and you got it and I was doing it prior to what courage ever been I don't care whether Republican it down and independent get out and get into the\nNeighborhoods neighborhoods where people are really suffering and and you know come on and Republicans need to get down into these neighborhoods and see what's going on for these people who can't access jobs who who are living in ... in shambles right\nGo prior Kathleen I'm gonna I'm so sorry to interrupt them and take it back from you there because um I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guest here\nA polar read your hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of them saying he's gonna he's gonna vote Republican almost entirely across as about for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen they're an Ohio things she's going to try and turn out democratic votes so I mean how much\nCan we tell how much has this fight over justice Kevin are really further energized I'm\nA voter's going into the midterms\nWell it's certainly energized voters going into the midterms to question is whether or not the geo ...\nOver the next month because well I said look at the cabinet confirmation process did not go how the White House had hoped but the one upside for them is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm election the poll showed that it was helping them sort of closes enthusiasm gap there were having trouble closing\nOn their own modality has been confirmed now that they sort of solidified have solidified honest conservative majority on the Supreme Court\nThe question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president I can just over the weekend I can hear him say this again him and his allies trying to sort of famous as it's all Democrats trying to obstruct their agenda with vendors for the Trump\nUm that the Trump victory in a presidential campaign to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November now there's no question that that folks on the other side Democrats have progressive that they are certainly mobilize and this has been a catalyst for many of them to vote or encourage others to vote\nBut again the big challenge for the president is allies can you sustain this yet another month\nNow Dick Pullman a here in Pennsylvania we've got a brand new district map congressional district map and so there we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't a restaurant in the last cycle here so how much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh affect what's gonna happen here no\nWell I think [noise] you know the capital things really in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly than the old when this when the new districts were by court ah and um they're much more sort of a ... they're much more of a sort of appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican voters in the old district\nUm and that but the Kavanaugh\nThing the chemical things relaxed and go to just sort of be a cap or on a lot of the energy that has driven a lot of suburban white women suburban white educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we've been talking about a blue wave for months or I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports now increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is it all depends how to do something\nIs going to land disproportionally in different places so a lot of the house districts were which were strung suburban districts like a lot of the ones in and around Philadelphia\nAh are um are being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of Republicans over a lot of things that are being nearly the latest\nSaw you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me the Democrats won't win the house and we need a net gain of twenty three they're probably going to pick up five or so in Pennsylvania alone home there's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide that are that reports\nIn in twenty sixteen those are very vulnerable so I think this whole thing about ... gonna it's gonna fall different different places the red state Senate red state Senate seats the Democrats have now that's where I can see a lot more Republican enthusiasm may be making a difference from from\nHere thinking nursing code and Heidi Heitkamp shoes\nShe might she might be tossed McConnell Mitch McConnell may be right when he says this is going to energize Republicans to keep the Senate the house I'm not sure well\nSo you're going to come to you here in a second but uh since Dick Pullman mentioned the Senate and we had that caller Kathleen from Ohio expressing her just taste for Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her vote to confirm justice Kevin ... we have a uh some tape here from Senator Collins she spoke with Scott Kelly on CBS is sixty minutes last night\nAnd said she felt very comfortable with her ... her decision to support cabinet despite the testimony given by professor Christine Blasey Ford\nShe was clearly terrified traumatized and I believed that a sexual assault had happened to her why\nI think she's mistaken about is who the perpetrator flats I Do not believe her assailant was Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that's the ... center to call them also spoke extensively on the floor of the Senate explaining why she was going to cast that affirmative vote for Kavanaugh and then we have\nThis strange happening on Twitter where Susan Rice apparently hints that she might do proto into a race against Susan Collins wouldn't hold up for re election in a couple of years I mean what's going on their\nSusan Collins was obviously one of the pivotal swing votes it's arguable that if she voted the other way than Joe Manchin the Democratic came out almost within moments of her announcing her vote or would have gone the other way and the cabinet nomination would have would have sunk\nNow progressive activists have already worked on a campaign to raise a lot of money for whichever Democrat challenges Susan Collins and twenty twenty she has a sole surviving blue state Republican in the Senate so that makes her a quite a target I think our reasons for voting for cabinet was that number one she said ideologically he's acceptable and that the president\nBusiness can support Rhode Island public radio says at ... dot org slash business\n\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we've got a special broadcast today from member station W H y y in Philadelphia and we are joined today by Dick Pullman he's national political reporter and writer of the national interest blog\nAt WHYY polar read is also with us She's CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs and so he'll ... joins us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg\nPolitics and said he wanted to turn something to you here because we heard Paula ah especially talk about before the break that the president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice Kavanaugh has kind of around a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other big issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily health care is has that whole sort of been temporarily set aside or do you think that that will will come back to voters and and candidates are going to come back to focus on these persistent\nIssues or the ... the country still grappling with\nYes healthcare certainly has not subsided that whatever happens in Washington you know what whatever kind of a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle is happening healthcare has remained\nIn more polls than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election it's deeply personal to them and I think the uh the efforts to repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act up in flames that debate\nOr in kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals and that is\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and the last we've seen the president's approval is\nSomewhere hovering around forty percent uh it's historically not good usually uh the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're Provo is at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but Democrats have more and more ... and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans in the Senate he is very he's in a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidate or trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered democratic vote it breaks down differently in different places that Republicans have kind of a dream of a Senate map where\nYou know twelve out of the Thirteen most competitive races are in states that President Trump wanted about half of them by massive margins\nWell I mean as you mentioned in and Dick actually mentioned before the break the midterm generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you\nFor Republicans are this coming November but on the other hand because of the acrimony over the cabinet or a confirmation and nomination we are hearing\nRepublican leaders talking about a re energized the base I mean Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on CBS his face the nation just yesterday saying that democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation have actually reinvigorated Republican voters\nIronically the behavior of as first the Democrats all of a sudden Judiciary Committee and then\nThe overreach of the protesters at the Capitol is actually energize the Republican base a particularly the red states where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to thank I Want to thank the other side for the tactics that have allowed us to got to energize and get involved all of voters\nDick Pullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings or the or the low approval ratings that we have the\nPresident ... well yeah maybe on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know\nHe's doing that in part because ah I don't know much else they they really have I mean you know we just talked to a few minutes ago about you know they pass tax reform but if you look at how tax reform as polling most Americans don't think it's really making much of a of a bite of not by much of a boost to their income so that really has been point very well\nOr they did promise to above a abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact where Democrats used to run away from Obamacare has a campaign issue\nThis year particularly on the house side they're bracing it and it's not just I don't you see it around here in Pennsylvania but over just across the river here in South New Jersey\nA there's a long time Republican congressional seat that is a very uh it may took to the Democrats this time because the Democratic candidate by the name of Andy Kim\nA is every day he's stressing healthcare\nA and they don't talk about you know they're not talking ... aren't really talking that much about cabinet are much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of\nFundamental kitchen table stuff\nUh that um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any a protest but potentially temporary spikes\nIn Republican enthusiasm so I think when McConnell is doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they said enough and they stuck it up enough you know the hoping the belief becomes reality but I think they have a a I'm a ways to go on closing the gap\nWill polar read I'm going to go to a couple of callers here but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at this um you know issues like like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in Pennsylvania's new seventh district or just this weekend and a lot of talk\nAbout health care and actually relatively less about Kavanaugh himself all the women across the board were very energized\nI think that's right you know Kavanaugh certainly something that's that's transfixed us here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership there what interests but I don't know\nNecessarily how much that were like I feel the polls even President Trump's election edited come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammer the president a harder on there for about ... a promise that made and and not kept yet\nYeah stick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they want to just circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point\nThat you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made mhm long term changes like that can that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or they're you know the sale that you're trying to do with voters here do you think they should now well I yeah I think they should\nGo uh uh ... you know maybe\nThere's this whole notion maybe a lot of Democrats hold on this notion that ah the courts are uh are impartial and independent and peoples and voters don't like to think of them as being part of the ... battlegrounds\nAh but the Republicans have successfully a campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight was\nTalking about the ah the war and the Warren Court and how the law you know we need more law and order\nCampaign against recording sixty eight successfully a and some so for years Democrats of not they have not stress the court or a and I thought the ... what happened with the Merrick Garland in twenty six you know I think if you flip the parties around and and a Republican ... Republican president been in office\nAnd had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee\nAnd he didn't even get you can get a hearing say from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I don't understand why the ... so he'll go ahead\nSorry I I just wanted to add a it's a great point that that makes because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and and the Berger court do the seventies things like Miranda rights for criminal suspects brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court bank racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built\nA very very successful and very effective movement a messaging with voter mobilization with millions and millions of dollars to a vet Supreme Court candidates were were solidly conservative you know who would vote with them and would advance their goals\nThey did that as a ... you know and and they were able to do that partly as a result of a backlash to these liberal decisions at the Supreme Court made in that time\nI my question I have now is whether the left in ... uh you know can do a similar thing now in an era where the Supreme Court has made decisions like Bush Gore on Citizens United which you know the the pro or anti campaign finance regulation ruling\nA that paved the way for a lot of dark money in politics to the Supreme Court decision to cut the voting rights act and and I mentioned the\nBlockade of a President Obama Supreme Court vacancy with Merrick Garland by Republican leaders in the Senate\nKent liberal use that to motivate their base to care about the Supreme Court because right now the ... the conservative a movement the conservative base has a massive advantage on this issue\nWill get a couple more calls here before we switch gears so let's go to Amanda calling from Charleston South Carolina Amanda you're on the air\nHigh had go ahead\nYeah it's I guess I Would just like to say that I we really we need a blue ... here and not a blue wave Mitch McConnell orange hatch a Chuck Grassley and I'll go ahead and try when Dianne Feinstein the\nAll right NPR dot org [noise]\n\nMajor funding for on green is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance through the Geico insurance agency additional information can be found at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nFrom W.

talking about gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is\nAdventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation hearing the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm joined here today by ... lives our species a multimedia journalists were WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because\nUh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court ah and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino to Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and\nYou know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a ... he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen really a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he\nFollowed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere's nothing in Pennsylvania ... which says and not have to be fair whenever fair me that he just took it upon themselves to say fairness means\nWhat was for one analyst called the Democrats dream map so it was a it was just such a [noise] it was just that take it unconstitutional taking of a power by the Supreme Court\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives are ... let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when to Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme\nCourt drew they didn't actually want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out yes and so the timeline here it was it was pretty much a crunch so\nAround ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of the right to free an equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislature said OK guys you know give us your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we saw these um these contingencies of different groups handing in math and just this Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes the governor was supposed to approve 'em the matter that the legislature um came up with it didn't have that didn't have\nThat first of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders to that was never passed by the general assembly in a form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court in all fairness to both sides of Supreme Court did not give the legislature I think adequate time to come up with a map even from the legislature could've come up with a map when when I met up and they went back to\nThis a clause in the constitution known as free in equal yeah which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suggesting\nThat they went back into a the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find that\nThere yeah there are so let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because they saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but but Terry's indicating here that\nBut this was a a novel reading one of the nation\nWell I think you also have to look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making the decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean they ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and are going into their federal court it could have gone on and on and on for a relatively long period of time as it worked its way up to the to the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge for off of you know different theory in the federal courts that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nSo there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now\nOn that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty something seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state now\nA deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether you know gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering where we get more moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend\nTo to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper polarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and here's what some voters in ... valley told us about what they see\nThe paper plates free for the church and uh there's pumpkin\nPastry and pulled pork on the table at the Chapman quarries United Methodist church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidate Marty no Stein a bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled walls reminding members to keep Jesus at their calls\nIn the middle of the road a volunteer has set up a life sized cut out of President Trump\nGiving us arms up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign of a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals the Lehigh Valley was previously split into a long lobster shaped district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nHis old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight points Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point\nMaking it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nI like to think of the valley is a microcosm of the United states blue dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we really try to better Rogers calls\nNo Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate won a cycling gold medal opposite ...\nKnow Stein also advocates were strict term limits but he falls in line with a GOP on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNo Stein is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and greet\nHe's not a pie in the sky conservative\nThere's people who are just the ideologues and he was not an ideologue he is a working man\nSo I ask Nicholas question does she think political compromise may be possible in her new balance district\nYou will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the global is\nNicholas says there's another divide she thinks Democrats are encouraging a sense of victimization and women other women at the table not in agreement\nFor Dr forward I think she was victimized\nShe came across as poor me that would not have been our response not by any means we refused to the victims we we would have been angry\nAnd yet when he closed does not approve of the fact that millions of women and men are angry right now and they're taking action\nThey're marching in the streets and protesting on Capitol Hill but to Nicholas that kind of anger isn't becoming it's not viable she says Ryan Rogers Marty no signs campaign staffer puts it this way\nI think that all somebody will come down to just the contrast of candidates are all things during results versus resistance running in the streets wearing\n\nSupport for on point comes from Charles River apparel making the New England or rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nI take my call [noise] um I I'm from uh eleven and Pennsylvania just thing is running [noise] and um I also helped [laughter] [noise] I also do some volunteer work for\nPets district and I was happy to see it is to districts are now competitive especially the the ... district but um\nI'd really like to say Pennsylvania move further and ... and make it more fair mhm\nAnd I really wonder why should this be more of a mathematical law a procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to top left of the state sort of traumatic like work your way through the population and the counties and Jay yeah boundaries\nRight it's a good question Jason and I mean ... even phones issue for a long time what do you think yeah I think you've got a great point there and and under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling and you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know a congressional districts me to be ... compact they need to be continuous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that you know I'm\nGoing forward or the ruling does say that there are these new choke hatred that needs to be considered before part is concerned but you know the quick didn't go so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes too partisan so there's it's today but there there are some guidelines that you know or the legislature can use going forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the point that the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of out of ... or politics always going to be part of this process\nOh I don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both tried to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre and these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better a jury may during because of the nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level\nYou and I just said knock the district or the ward level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nOther one's still is is that the rules for the algorithm [laughter] August when I was thinking we think computers can do a better let's take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call I live in northern Sonoma County that's the Akron Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican governor and a Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over in ... northern summit county which was the Democratic area and we now have a Republican congressman ... when they see\nAnd it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our democratic congressman\nMm yeah man I made a thing to go ahead have and how to make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats are put in another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats\nBut that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has done by law but when you get all these\nLawmakers in state after state after state that has a huge difference on writing the laws\nAre each day you know that govern was ... and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election was huge not just in terms of the bringing the Tea Party to power the radiological conservatism that it represents\nGo head was yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the laws they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined the Democrats ... ... you're not partisan but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district in Maryland yeah so this is not partisan both parties will do that\nWell that's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it on the other they have done here in\nPennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere people keep talking to me about Marilyn a California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to them and let me let me play for you I'm\nA a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's the book GOP chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just takes he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second he poses other systems to drop future congressional map and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best position to draw a line than\nThey are today heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation\nThat draws party you know political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps or their favors and other states like Maryland so you know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder fair disturbing plan they called it to take back\nThe rational seats and they've done it here in Pennsylvania that\nFailed to Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair citizens' lives are so he he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps but there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania I just have\nTo say I love that um operatic music behind fail in Columbus Day festival in Philadelphia was picking me there to south Philly um so you know a a group a\nPennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement and independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they've modeled this after California\nAnd um this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them at events canvassing and you know ah they they they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interests to form this commission\nAs you pointed out if there is a such a commission in California made up of a appointed independent citizens and I think some several other a couple of other states in the west have similar similar commission so who do they work they have they created fair districts\nUm if you talk to the the people on the commission yes if you talk to voters yes I think a key difference between\nAnd there's no referendum sell basically and to get that process in place at the state legislature would have to pass a constitutional amendment and then it would go to the voters for in a referendum\nThere's no guarantee there's no guarantee that an independent commission itself would be truly independent I mean there's any assaulted by somebody yeah they are that that that's or or hold positions by birds get on get on the commission by virtue of a position they already home\nOr you could have state lawmaker leaders of point of view you could have different groups yeah it can get", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence",
