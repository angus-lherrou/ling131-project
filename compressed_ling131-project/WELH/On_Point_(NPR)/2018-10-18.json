inevitable for years that I'd have to write the following sentence Sears Holdings Corp wants towering force in American moles that was a central and creating the blueprint for the twenty century retail\nIs preparing to file for bankruptcy\nWhy does it feel inevitable\nWell because this was the result of a very very long slow decline and I sort of break it into two parts\nAt Sears in two thousand for a a financier named Eddie ... orchestrated it's merger with Kmart and that has been as quite disastrous chapter I she's mismanaged the company in a number of ways that I'm sure we can delve into more detail a and that has played a key role in bringing it to this point of bankruptcy\nBut long before that throughout the nineties in the eighties\nSears the missteps for just piling up that left it not well positioned to compete in today's retail environment\nOkay so let's talk about some of those missteps because I think at first blush people when they see a major retailer or have to declare bankruptcy these days\nThey think it's because they haven't been able to keep up with a you know online shopping and the the the major changes in the way Americans are shopping is that the case or I mean it sounds like you're saying that the ... came along before Amazon came along\nYes exactly so we can we can relate to the Nineteen eighties when Sears with sort of just cutting off of it but I think of as it it didn't puerile period that postwar post World war two or three of the seventies when it was in you know just this really dominant retailer and in the eighties I think it had a bit of hubris\nOn and it started to get distracted by adding different lines of business so it acquired Caldwell banker acquired a finance firm called dean Witter just started taking its eye off the ball of what it knew how to do best was which was to sell people stuff\nUm and then also some pre Internet changes started happening that Sears didn't quite know how to grapple with and that was mainly in the form of these so called category killers these big box paradise says\nLike Best Buy Home Depot Lowe's even staples id sort of large for net stores that specialized in one category Sears didn't really do a good job of adapting to those concepts which flourished in the nineties\nBecause we aren't just public radio in the ... the public radio\n[noise]\nSupport for on white comes from

bankruptcy and what it means for retail in America in two thousand Eighteen the once dominant perhaps the dominant retailer in the United states for more than a century\nCan't hold on and his going into chapter eleven we're talking this hour with Sarah ... actually the Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industries\nVicki Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of for main street tomorrow the rise and fall the American department store\nAnd Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how Sears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country now was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know and it's competition was Montgomery Ward it also had a catalog in the late Nineteen century\nUm but I just was a way that um rural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states\nThat were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out\nOn a railroad cars you know across the country\nAnd you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded or I mean as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard wards tears and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business that all that I was allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these untapped customers in rural parts of the ...\nUm I mean I think the uh they started out as\nA selling watches so it was just a sort of limited uh from in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with\nBut it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board um and he took the company into it sort of a modern day for us so I I think that this was the gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between the rich and the poor and but you know it was a time of industrialization\nAnd I'm also movement into cities and\nA growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also I'm going to access\nOther otherwise they would have had to travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or maybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so\nIt really was a ... about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street an entrepreneur um a sort of\nGoing to get small towns across the country and then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nSarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets and opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as as Vicki Howard is saying also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many moles in America\nYeah I think in some ways a story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still rural and agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns on and making that adaptation so quickly\nI mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores where the majority of their business compared to uh\nThe catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and the speed with which even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think fears occupies such an important place in retailing history in Congress and\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with the seniors are shocked as the years perhaps at least once in their lives so lots of lots of memories you go to Deborah who's calling from Watertown, Connecticut debris you're on the air\nYes making great show I I'm I have worked for two great American institutions fears and potential um and potential continues to thrive and fears of course is not\nI started my fears when I was a kid during the Vietnam War um my father was military sergeant stationed in Japan so we ordered everything that we needed\nI Would pour over it for hours\nUm I think fear has been off to fight and heading for trouble for a long time\nI worked for years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school in house where um the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope his kids here this\nHe was the top housewares manager and the entire country he was very innovative very successful very aggressive he he was a fair about knowing the merchandise yeah send me an spying missions to see what other stores were charging so he could set prices in sales based on that information\nHe had made cooking chicken and ham inside the store grilling it\nSo that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love to see sounds like a really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted beyond manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know\nAnd I especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those states about\nI'm an old style manager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with a customer who wanted to order replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard\nBut he was really really difficult and really unhappy and heart to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy with that his wife had left him\nBut not the grill uh-huh\nAnd and I and I couldn't I couldn't handle and when I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you and I hung up on it and he\nCalled store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store\nManager who we never saw before who was a you know young man college educated war suit came down to you know get my head on a Potter and drawn stuck up for me\nUh-huh he said she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat me down and he gave me you know the coffee is always right lecture but she stuck up for me\nWe'll Debra thank you so much for your call and for your memories there and and a really wonderful example about or perhaps how were qualified people that you weren't at least in this case weren't getting promoted thank you Deborah let's go quickly to Chris who's calling from state College Pennsylvania Chris you're on the air\nAre great program or what but not just ... ... ... ... the role of the vulture capital of coming up you know the hedge love the bodies corporation of a\n... for the health table so back to the purchase price or the ... gone with ... or all the\nCrap out of a walk the walk at all Catholic now they're just going back and we're or a load the shell of a corporation and all the federal somebody else\nI see Chris thank you for your call Sarah ... ah did that happen to see here's where they were they purchased by hedge fund or or a private equity business at one time\nAh so any land bird that who just stepped down as CEO and who orchestrated it's merger with Kmart he is a hedge fund guy\nOn and he has used a lot of those hedge fund tactics to try to keep Sears a flow in recent years so and this is one of the main knocks of his tenure is that he didn't really have emergence instinct he wasn't running series like a retailer he was running it was sort of his henchmen guy had on and so he is\nAnd you know doing things like spinning off it's real estate providing loans are selling things like that crashed into a brand sort of moving around financial chess pieces to keep it alive but he wasn't really making it a better retailer\nWell so should we talk more about this then because they think the presumption when you hear that a retailer goes into bankruptcy is that somehow\nThey were doing business wrong but it may have nothing to do with that I mean as a as our caller pointed out we have so many examples Toys R us he's right is another one but it was a hedge funds were private equity managers using these companies are as credit cards

a chocolate bar the we're talking this hour about seniors declaring bankruptcy on Monday and what that means for this major American retailer it's been a retailer at the heart of American Life for more than a hundred years and ah what that means for retail as we move forward in the digital age\nI mean let's listen here to a clip from a Sears ad from the Nineteen nineties featuring Bob Vila home improvement television host also a Sears commercials spokesperson\nTalking about all the things you can accomplish with yours products\nRemodeling a kitchen or bathroom such a big job\nWho can you trust to do it all and do it right [noise] [noise]\nHi, Bob Vila for Sears the home improvement professionals maybe you've been dreaming about a beautiful new kitchen or updating your bad well if it's too big a job to do yourself stress the job the Sears they've been in business for over a hundred years\nWell below there in the Nineteen nineties ... long history in the retail business you've got comments coming in on our website a debit says Sears was our parents and our parents parents store when I think as the years I think of craftsmen Kenmore\nThe only two brands I ever bought their they're still manufactured and can be but elsewhere are so that's a comment from our website on point radio dot org let's go to Dave who's calling from Buffalo New York Dave you're on the air\nHi how're you doing doing great day what's your thoughts are taking my call yeah go ahead\nOh okay yeah you know I'm a I said I'm a I'm a current shares employee [noise] um I'm a service technician and you know what I'm we're just getting bigger and bigger we're not actually attached to it or a outlet uh-huh shares is always going to be there\nAs they explained it to us if you think of it this way\nIt's going full circle hears it was a catalogue company like apple outlet for it and you guys talk very interesting and you know Sears catalog company and then they started having sports or\nThe digital age is here in the millennial vi everything on line just about and I'm I'm a father than kids and I and I were your over the years yeah you're on a great place to work\nAnd I read and um they're full circle\nSo ... so they can I just hope and you're like me first full circle what do you mean by that because if you say your service technician in ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah they don't have your you know what we're um Sears and the fact groups are are are they said for applying for electronic because we do other I'm like we do\nA Lowe's Home Depot or rules um that's why we do all the service I see stables long with all the store\nYou know wherever wherever appliances sold ... the orange juice or\nDave I'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a Bloomberg opinion columnist David he's feeling confident at least for his part of Syria's business and he sees the company's coming full circle what do you think\nSo I think there's something to the fact that the services area is if if you had to call out some bright spots at Sears services would be one and that's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on that day you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances with then\nBecause uh they have this relationship with you I had their services business so there is something to that that this idea then coming full circle\nI think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and look at the labor it's been saying for years that Sears is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened\nThey keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of ... okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it it it actually might be less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I it it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent and categories like apparel it's probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty present in apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar stores fears couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing\nExactly and I think that's why yes this is definitely a story an Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story and so you're getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterparts I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's a those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nAt Best Buy stock in your all time high is that it as it has staged a remarkable turnaround is taking share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off price stores like T. J. max and Ross which have been on a tear in recent years and taking share away from traditional department stores like seers\nWell let's go to John who's calling from Detroit Michigan John you're on the air\nThank you saw a guy my first craftsman set of tools back when I was a teenager in the seventies and I was a you know no pun intended guy or a fierce version [noise] um and then when I got involved in the communities of Detroit we'll find out that there's actually a catalog houses\nAre right down the street from me that were built in the forties that were purchased right out of the catalog and force\nSaturday Detroit or the last Twenty years and it's probably been ten years since I've been a ... [noise]\nI they just don't pay us like they used to\nYeah well John thank you for your call Vicky Howard you're the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one myself uh from the Nineteen twenties\nI'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're they're lovely homes ah and um it I think that they had their special special catalog devoted to to them that closed\nA down I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe on but you know you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in the U.S and you might possibly be able to identify them as a serious home\nYeah well so they can hurt a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how uh in two thousand Eighteen yes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and I mean you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so\nSo why is there just seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores Sears among them are having trouble will hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Wal Mart and Amazon is\nSort of taking over our in our thoughts of you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um and you know the urge you to occupy a space\nThat Wal Mart to um uh uh now does\nA as the largest retailer in the country a Walmart be overtook the years and I'm In the early Nineteen nineties so I think that it Sears needs to be seen in through the longer um trajectory of at Sarah a\nSignal or hurt really comments that ... what happened to Sears not just about the last few years it's about sort of a long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties\nAnd if it's it isn't inevitable um I I Do believe that um\n[noise] uh that all of those uh missteps or\nMight have made a difference you know in the short term of survival of a from like like seers\nBut I Do think that if you look at the department store industry as a whole that that sector has been a losing out to the big box stores\nTo disc before them even a even before them the discounters target a K. Mart Walmart all all founded in Nineteen sixty two and I'm growing up going to the Nineteen seventies that to the traditional department store of which Sears is it a\nPlays a part is more of a staple goods to um\nStandard where sort of change right we got sector's been losing out\nYou know so I'm hearing over and over again through this hour uh Sarah ... that a leadership matters right vision and an executive or\nA practice and and where where you'll leave the company really really matters but of course when a company files for bankruptcy or or has to retract and shrink profitability as you said the cost of that falls on the on the backs of of employees I'm seeing\n\nMajor funding from point it's because I like Ike out offering auto insurance coverage for cars tracks or SUV and providing twenty four sat in customer service more information on auto insurance at ... dot com or one eight hundred nine four sat in on him [noise]\nW.

L. E. Y. travel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a Chuck ... we're talking this hour about a Trump Administration proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price of their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring\nCosts down but there is significant debate about whether or not that is indeed what would happen\nAnd we are joined today by Dr Michael ... he is vice president of medical affairs at farmers that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us from washing today and we definitely want to hear from you about one eight hundred\nFor two or three eight to five five it's eight hundred and four to three\nTalk uh Mike Lee borrow there's\nThis is kind of a basic question I Want to ask when they need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so first of all I'm saying here that uh the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half billion dollars on advertising in two thousand Seventeen nearly four point two billion of that on television at\nAn age age is also says that that advertising can result in increased utilization through patients demanding costly drugs and products based on messaging which increased government costs\nSo I'm going to pursue that is pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what a day just to say that it can influence patient choices\nSo if they if the advertising is that effective I just want to get to why the ... the farm industry is\nIs resisting the idea of having some price trance transparency in those ads isn't it one of the best ways to inform patients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost\nShirt so I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do is raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patients to the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources so I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today\nYou know leads to increased awareness that doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one that is the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important I think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy efforts which is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals\nSo that it's not just the list price that doesn't have added context it also has information on potential out of pocket costs for the patient as well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they're I'm faced with situation stressful situations um if you're diagnosed with a serious illness\nPeople to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiated in fact there are some discounts that are written into the law Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given\nUm how would that be reflected in the TV ad would that lead to medicate mission to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah there's a the VA has discounts there's discounts negotiated between private insurance companies pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers and there's no other discount programs there was a three forty discount program so\nThere's no doubt [laughter] there's no doubt that the complexity of the system is ... uh but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener or Facebook or Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what will work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree\nWell I I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see\nI think that overall moves the health literacy conversation in the right direction or you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago um the the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression\nOr you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize the variety of reasons that maybe they weren't brought up\nUm and so while you may not like a specific advertisements um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines\nAre there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for thing for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses and maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nIt well Dr Michael uber has standby here for just a second uh because I Want to bring in a couple of other voices\nInto this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist and senior fellow at the health foundation project hope\nShe was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush also an advisor to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential\nCampaign Gail Wilensky welcome to them point needs to be here with you it's great to have you and also with us joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNonprofit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having me so ... you have an extended experience as the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America\nOr I just want to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in pharmaceutical advertising will lead to or could lead to reduced or reduce costs overall that's the goal would have happened\nProbably not a I think having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing that people will make their decisions about drugs based on what it will cost them\nNow with the drug costs is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation where people think oh that's a really expensive dry it must be new and special and and very powerful maybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence\nThe behavior according to what something costs the relevance\nAt the time when a drug is being considered and then the relevant question for patients is what will it cost me if I take this drug or not they drag that's really what's relevant\nPatients right and because of the way the American health care system a is right there are so many different answers to that question of what it could cost me and there's\nI mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's not a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there's some pretty general guidelines so if you are on Medicare and have\nA what is called a um a supplementary policy they'll be general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician or that it's important information because there is a lot of variability\nBut it doesn't really help people to have information about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never going to you have well did that just information that's not going to be helpful\nBut David mitchell is it possible though that the shock value of seeing these high high numbers for certain drugs could I don't know produce public pressure or on the pharmaceutical companies to bring their ... their prices down\nWell first I agree with what's been set already that are putting the list prices on me as it's not going to lower the prices of prescription drugs in this country\nI also don't think that ah by forcing the companies to put the list prices on that they will be shamed because the big drug companies in this country have shown that they're willing to be ashamed to all the way to the bank\nUm they continue to raise prices way beyond as you said at the top of the show a rate of inflation or health costs inflation these take a toll on patients like me I have an incurable blood cancer my drugs cost twenty four thousand dollars every time they've given me\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for a driver's across America more information on auto insurance\nAvailable and Tyco dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nAnd Charles River apparel making the New England or rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel\nTo prepare folks for whatever the day has in store the new fall collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking today about a Trump Administration proposal to require drug companies to disclose the list prices for their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising and I'm joined today by Dr Michael you borrowed he's vice president of medical affairs at pharma\nThat's the trade and lobbying group of the American pharmaceutical industry he's also an emergency room physician David mitchell joins us he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and ... is with us as well she's an economist is senior fellow at the health foundation\nProject hope and she's also a former director of Medicare and Medicaid she served in that position or in the administration of President George W. Bush\nOr no deal if you want to ask you want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous a segment\nAnd that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who really rely on Medicare and against want an offer some some context you're on the differences that might make David had mentioned\nShe Mira a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation or Abbey pharmaceuticals and in twenty Fifteen fourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks were pay the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug cost Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars in Switzerland the only difference there being is that we've got governments negotiate on the other half of patients and those other countries to why aren't we doing that here\nWhen you need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is governments negotiating prices a governance don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare I helped set through the Congress that's actually does it\nA set prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community and the hospitals ... it's a taker relieve and here's what we're paying a you can participate in Medicare or not or as you choose\nUm there it is true the federal government could set prices for pharmaceuticals that is what happens in many other countries\nThere's ... has been concern that because of the very long\nPipeline between at the time a drug is first thought about\nTo be about ten years that that very long pipeline makes it quite different than other drugs or if you have government I set the price or other physicians is too low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to physicians and the concern has been\nThat if the federal government I said some of the prices too low you would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area\nFor six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there was\nAll that I joined up here and yes you a quick question about that so is is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research well patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost we definitely\nDo subsidize the research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect because as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment anytime there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along handling the FDA do everything I can to expedite\nOr the availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact on what we saw that for example with hepatitis C when there was one drug by gilly ad out out of the price was extremely high when you had a second proud and come out by ... the\nThe price of the dried dropped to a very comparable level to the u._k.\nNow that is something we can control okay we can do the other\nIt will have a disproportionate effect on the amount of research\nPeople have to decide if that's what they want a and that's what they're willing to live with\nDavid mitchell would you like to respond to that I mean because I've heard this again and again from you know from people like you who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many new drugs coming down the pipeline ten years from now does that sound realistic to you\nKnow um first of all I had an incurable blood cancer or it's a terrible because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second line or a drug so\nThe need for innovation a new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but\nSecretary of health and Human Services and former head of a CEO of Louis in the U.S Alex days are said recently drug companies have tried to tell us we can't have innovation and affordable prices at the same time\nThat if we cut one penny of profits from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation in America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy e oh he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex Caesar who worked at age eight just maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this is a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and new drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's taxpayers are paying we're paying for the new driver with a member of the research budget event ... next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars\nAnd they do the basic science there and increasingly they actually do drug development and then when the drug shows promise that drug companies would be an end require the intellectual property and then\nThousand dollars a year so I Believe we can have both a and we need to return to balance from maximizing profit for the drug companies to maximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robust aren't the pipeline we can do that as a country\nMichael ... was that you I heard there yeah go ahead yeah well I wanted to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry\nTo bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget as close to forty billion dollars are member companies and the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year our research and development cc almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the by pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments the market and the way I think about it is\nThat an age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem\nI'm from the standpoint of just so much research that's occurring care you look at scientists from around the world that want to do their training here um folks that apply to medical schools I'm from outside the u._s. they want to do their residency is they want to do research\nUh here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have the balance between a investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment that's made on behalf by the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's it's also important to note that our country incentivize as innovative therapies it it it is a different system in the U. S. than in other countries we balance a balance that out by bringing\nA generic to market um a patent is so long at the end of the patent life\nI'm two or three new medicines come to market and the price drop some times as much as Ninety percent\nUm and you don't see that in other countries and other countries you see that they pay more for generics than we do here\nAnd they they don't value new innovative therapies the same way that we do and one other interesting point that I'll just note as most other countries as a percentage of their budget spend about the same on medicines as we do so it's not that um it's not the just medicines are more expensive and the U.S [noise]\nUm but you actually see the health care in general is more expensive and so I think if you focus on medicines exclusively you missed the bigger picture and you miss the fact that there are tremendous numbers of inefficiencies in the U.S health care system that we could do a better job of a you know we could address and we could lower overall cost that will\nCross Mike Lee by a couple of things there so you you said that uh\nThat wants to drugs come off patent generics pop up and costs drop by Ninety percent but it is true though that that that a lot of pharmaceutical companies do what they can they're not always successful but they do what they can to extend those patterns I mean we've seen that over and over again with with different kinds of drugs that yeah I think we have to at least acknowledge that\nNinety percent of medicines dispensed in this country or generic we have one of the highest generic utilization rates of any country in the world nine out of ten prescriptions\nThe public radio eighty nine point three ...\nMajor funding from the point is provided by Geico offering

an automobile he had little interest in automobiles [laughter] which is kind of surprising for avoid back in that era but he had become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he bought he had his mommy saved every penny from everything you did\nTo buy 'em model airplanes that he built in in flight magazines of various kinds and uh\nAnd so it was really the passion for airplanes and flying you know in later after he becomes first man and becomes this iconic figure\nUm some biographers or you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was you know looked at the stars and was big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that's true I mean you know I didn't get interested in that until much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened\nGoing to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu in Korea and becoming a test pilot he really what led him to space was really not any you know Germany passion on his part as a as a boy but really just sort of the\nThe wave of technology in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night that he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying or or or didn't fall but he was just hovering in history\nHe he did have that story and what was I think really a interesting about it was he was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who really you know um\nI mean there was a spiritual side to win but he wasn't the sort of person who\nWho would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was or what he became\nAnd so he had this recurring dream and so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because you know I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much of that you know\nUh so he was a very practical minded guy and and and even as a boy was type of was the type of proto engineer and we looked at things\nBut also he was saying that profoundly go a goal oriented very ambitious because\nYou write about how you were saying this is a minute ago but it wasn't necessarily some sort of a passion for space and space exploration necessarily that drove him but that all the great aviation accomplishments had already been done any kind of resented that and it was space that was the next step\nYeah that was a you know he he had growing up in the thirties and they were still lots of first that were happening in terms of violating an aviation\nAnd of course reading all those um flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great pioneering flights of that ... of the post of the pre World War two era and he kind of thought as a boy well everybody's got those done and and now what's next [laughter]\nOf course he didn't realize that there are all sorts of things yet to calm\nYeah well so give me and said I Want to talk with you in some detail about an area of Neil Armstrong's life that the movie focuses on quite a bit and that's the death of his two year old\nA daughter Karen I'm so first of all let's let's just play a scene here from the movie first man you'll hear Ryan Gosling who plays Neil Armstrong in in this scene he's asked about caring staff\nYou know sorry to hear about your daughter [noise]\nSorry for your question [noise]\nRight well I mean are you thinking will have an effect [noise] I think he would be\nReasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect\nThe scene from the movie first man gave him the first of all tell us a little bit about uh Armstrong started what happened to her\nWell may I say that in terms of that scene what I what really strikes me um two things struck me the most and that is one that ... the screenwriter used verbatim a quote that I mean what Neal says in that scene\nA about being unreasonable to assume that would have no effect that comes directly from my interview with him back in the early to thousands\nI cause I asked him that specific question about did he think it had in fact one of his flying and on his crew choices afterwards and that exactly as what he's already answered so of course I Love that scene which is exactly what Neal said\nThe other thing about seeing which I think it's relevant to you\nAt eighty nine point three of them at the public's radio dot org\nSupport for on point comes from Charles River up heroin making the New

things so much for having me\nSo first walk us through kind of the the the basic proposal here what exactly what the Trump Administration like to do regarding a prices and pharmaceutical advertising\nShort so Monday the administration proposed a rule that would require drug companies to less a products monthly wholesale price or the cost of a typical of course of treatment is a monthly price doesn't make sense\nUm if the drug costs more than thirty five dollars for thirty days\nAnd the information would have to appear in TV ads in a written format and have to be large enough to for people to read so you can just you know kind of a tiny fine print in the air and the author suggesting to include some other language like a statement that patients with health insurance may pay a different than than this amount\nI see okay but does does a ha just have the power to compel pharmaceutical companies to do this I I I ... it wasn't clear to me if Congress had given the department of health and Human Services that power\nWell that's definitely a question that people are debating this week and I think the pharmaceutical industry ... thinks they don't and plans to file a they've indicated they will likely file legal action on those grounds\nAge age as is saying that there than there is a lot of Supreme Court precedent and First Amendment rulings that\nSays that the federal government can require disclosure of factual information from companies effect disclosure for there's some government interests and it's not\nFor it and found that they pointed to cases like car ads for car manufacturers are also required to disclose that there's a number of other industries some insurance industry has have to do this as well\nThey also said basically they're using their

L. E. Y. travel dot com [noise]\n\nIs on point a magnitude ... we're talking this hour about a Trump Administration proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price of their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring\nCosts down there is significant debate about whether or not that is indeed what would happen\nAnd we are joined today by Dr Michael ... he is vice president of medical affairs at farmers that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us from washing today and we definitely want to hear from you at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred and four to three\nTalk uh Mike Lee by there's\nThis is kind of a basic question I Want to ask but I Need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so the first of all I'm saying here that uh the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half billion dollars on advertising in two thousand Seventeen nearly four point two billion of that on television ads\nAnd ha just also says that that advertising can result in increased utilization through patients demanding costly drugs and products based on messaging which increase government costs\nSo I'm going to presume that if pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what age age as to say that it can influence patients' choices [noise] so if they if they advertising is that effective I I just want to get to ...\nResisting the idea of having some price trans transparency in those ads isn't at one of the best ways to inform patients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost shirt\nSo I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do\nIs raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising a pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patience to the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today\nYou know leads to increased awareness it doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one that the the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important I think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy efforts\nWhich is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals\nSo that it's not just the list price that doesn't have added context it also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient as well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they are um base was situation stressful situations\nUm if you're diagnosed with a serious illness cancer hepatitis are HIV ...\nWe don't want people to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiate and in fact there are some discounts that are written into law a Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given um how would that be reflected in the TV ad would that lead a medication to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah\nThere's a the VA has discounts there's discounts negotiated between private insurance companies pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers and there's no other discount programs there was a three forty discount program so\nThere's no doubt [laughter] there's no doubt that the complexity of the system is satirist a but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener Facebook a Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what will work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree\nWell I I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see\nI think that overall and moves the health literacy conversation in the right direction or you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago um that the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression\nOr you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize the variety of reasons that maybe they weren't brought up\nUm and so while you may not like a specific advertisement um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines are there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for things for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses and maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nWell Dr Michael uber stand my hair\nEr into this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist and senior fellow at the health foundation project hope she was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W.

Bush\nOr no deal if you want to ask you want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous a segment\nAnd that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of ...\nI just want to offer some some contacts you're on the differences that might make David had mentioned she Mira a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation or Abbey pharmaceuticals and\nIn twenty Fifteen fourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks were pay the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars\nThat same drug cost Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars and Switzerland the only difference there being is that we've got governments negotiate on the on the behalf of patients and those other countries so why aren't we doing that here when you need\nTo stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is governments negotiating prices are governments don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare I helped set through the Congress that's actually does it\nA set prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community and the hospitals it's take or leave it here's what we're paying a you can participate in Medicare or not or as you choose\nUm if there is true the federal government could set prices for pharmaceuticals that is what happens at in many other countries\nThere's a lot has been concern that because of the very long\nPipeline between at the time a drug is\nFirst thought about and by the time it gets to market are estimated to be about ten years\nThat that very long pipeline makes it quite different than other drugs or if you have government I set the price a of a physician visit to low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to physicians\nAnd the concern has been that if the federal government a set some of the prices too low you would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area\nFor six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there was\nOlder than age I end up in your gas you a quick question about that so is is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research while patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost we\nDefinitely do subsidize research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect\nBecause as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment anytime there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along having the FDA do everything it can to expedite\nUh the availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact what we saw that for example with hepatitis C when there was one drug by gilly ad out of the price was extremely high when you had a second proud and come out by ... v\nThe ... up the price of the drug dropped to a very comparable level to the u._k.\nNow that is something we can control okay we can do the other\nIt will have a disproportionate effect on the amount of research\nPeople have to decide if that's what they want a and that's what they're willing to live with\nMitchell would you like to respond to that I mean because I've heard this again and again from you know from people like you who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many\nFrom now does that sound realistic to you\nKnow I'm a first of all I had an incurable blood cancer or it's incurable because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second line of drugs so\nThe need for innovation and new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but\nSecretary of health and Human Services and former head of a CEO of Louis in the U.S Alex days are said recently drug companies have tried to tell us we can't have innovation and affordable prices at the same time\nThat if we cut one penny of profits from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation in America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy EEO he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex ... who worked at age age as maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this is a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and new drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's taxpayers are paying we're paying for the new driver with a member of the research budget event ... next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars\nAnd they do the basic science there and increasingly they actually do drug development\nAnd then when the drug shows promise the drug companies will be an end require the intellectual property and then president four hundred five hundred eight hundred thousand dollars a year so I Believe we can have both a and we need to return a balance from maximizing profit for the drug companies to\nMaximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robust are anti pipeline we can do that as a country\nLee by was that you I heard there yeah go ahead yeah well I wanted to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry to bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget is close to forty billion dollars\nAre member companies and the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year our research and development cc almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the by pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments to market and the way I think about it is\nThen age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can't say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem\nI'm from the standpoint of just so much research that's occurring here you look at scientists from around the world that want to do their training here on folks that apply to medical schools I'm from outside the U. S. they want to do their residency they want to do research\nI here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have the balance between the investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment it's made on behalf by the by a pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's it's also important to note that our country incentivize as innovative therapies it it it is a different system in the U.S than in other countries we balance a balance that out by bringing\nA generics to market um a patent is so long at the end of the patent life\nI'm two or three new uh medicines come to market and the price drop sometimes as much as Ninety percent\nUm and you don't see that in other countries and other countries you see that they um pay more for generics than we do here and they they don't value new innovative therapies the same way that we do and one other interesting point that I'll just note as most other countries\nAs a percentage of their budget spent about the same on medicines as we do so it's not that um it's not that just medicines are more expensive and the U.S [noise]\nUm but you actually see the health care in general is more expensive and so I think if you focus on medicines exclusively you miss the bigger picture and you miss the fact that there are tremendous numbers of inefficiencies in the U.S health care system that we could do a better job\n... Ross Michael by a couple of things are just so you you said that uh\nThat uh once drugs come off patent a generic pop up and costs drop by Ninety percent but it is true though that that that a lot of pharmaceutical companies do what they can they're not always successful but they do what they can to extend those patterns I mean we've seen that over and over again with with different kinds of drugs that I think we have to at least acknowledge that\nNinety percent of medicines dispense in this country or generic we have one of the highest generic utilization rates of any country in the world nine out of ten prescriptions", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "18"}
