leaders igniting transformation Milwaukee a nonprofit organization led by use of color\nOr that organizes young people around issues related to political power and social racial and economic justice cab welcome Don point\nHi David thank you for having me\nKay first let's start with you a a George two minutes from Milwaukee himself but what struck you about ah our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest thing that struck me was talking about star code switching and I find that often for me because I Do I Do live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as I go to a like to go out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about code switching is basically as a as I as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I I'll even to NPs or not in the ... but it will in rocky because that's where I live but when I started as a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame for me going from\nBeing around people all day who look and talk just like me now coming here to people who look completely different than me and had different lingo and different things than I have so\nMore I was ill you started playing and people would not understand what I meant by saying certain words or I Would just feel different for talking less proper than they did so I kinda get\nStarted teaching myself that when I met or I talked property values proper English and when I go home I'm able to talk\nHow I feel comfortable talking and you dislike that my family and friends I used to\nYou know there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a start Carter is played by the actor a mental a stern bird uh she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights are poor and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is an affluent mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nA in this scene as I start enters Williamson she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is\nGuiding heights of one world\nAnd I got to keep it separate so when I'm here I'm Sorry version to that means slipping a switch in my brain Williamson stars doesn't use slang if a rapper would say if she doesn't even for white friends to have to pay how are you in the\nSpring makes them cool thing makes me put you know those kids\nFace scans Kay is that what you're talking about\nYes that is exactly what I'm referring to\nI Wonder ... you know do you read uh uh uh the book as well if I'm not mistaken are these things that kind of play out in your own life where you you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in the suburbs when I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks and now you have to act is completely different and so because of the areas of where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because um\nIt's like you because you are\nBlack saying these words and acting like this makes you appear as hood and makes you appear as less educated than somebody else so when you're around these people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both from I mostly white communities and mostly probably do is likely to these the way I spoke the way I talked with a dress that way I act it was completely different side definitely can relate to that idea of Code Switch team\nWhich at how much like how much of an extra burden is that walking around having to think consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway um I think\nIt's definitely an extra burden that we have because for black people it's this idea of a double identity that we always have to face this\nNow\nDimitrius you want to go in there for ... no I'm Sorry okay go ahead ... ready to start a lead\nRate hikes [laughter] I um I definitely think that\nWay more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always face was having to fight so many negative stereotypes it's already approaching this and the first place so I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and learn about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in a world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing by people aren't educated there Mr that three hundred they'll never wiring blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like\nSo what do I have to cook for myself to to seem like I can make it so I think code switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people\nFully aware of ourselves yet and civil or face are trying to be ourselves but then also face I'm trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already the idea of perfection other people's eyes uh we are to be trusted you have a different\nTake on that um I agree on that one Minnesota situations like when I have like a job interview or something I'll put it on a voice like not to be like a pill like a white voice that's correct but um\n[noise] do you get back on the back to me don't\nYou sure of course I actually ... what I did want to ask you about a little bit was you know we heard from a maverick who's the father\nOf a stark harder in the opening scene about how important must be proud of being black in at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black kids are boys and girls needed to handle themselves when they were dealing with law enforcement officials reach you did you ever receive a version of the talk like that\nUm yes ah received a talk like that when I was younger so how does lay out what was that like um it was this one night we me and my father\nWas like in the kitchen token they were just talking about driving and stuff and we got to the topic about police when we get pulled over and a recent poll I wanted to cause pull over like he always put his hands on the steering wheel Antonio I get older and let's get a license to do that\nAnd like a few months back that happen like the cuts put us over and my father to his hands on his third wheel so I've had my hands on dash or two it was kind of nervous 'cause like the videos and Messina seeing lately on social media about like the police brutality and like how graphic it can get\nA ... you know uh in Chicago obviously a there's a trial of the uh of the police officer who shot look one McDonald\nOr he was found guilty that doesn't always happen or a police officer goes on trial for the shooting of want to start Carter's friends in in the movie the hatred given I'm not going to give away a plot point by saying how that plays out\nAh but at the same time you know that was a big deal for what happened in Chicago how has received a you know and among your family and friends\nUm it was received very positively um ever since the entire thing happened with the ... so many Chicago activists organizations had been doing so much work for the class family for those who are affected by police fatality and\nWhen we found out that Jason Van Dyke was going on trial and then everything that's happening we were just so scared that it was going to happen again\nThat another police officer was going to get away with killing a young black teenager and we were just so worried that when we were all watching it we're just like silent I remember watching it on the phone with my friend and we were like\n[noise] ... comes from college fine work and some things work with high school students do identify

[noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik we're talking to three young African American activists about life in their communities were inspired by the release at least broadly today of the film the heat you give but our conversation as expanding to so much more\nYou can join our conversation what are you hearing from these students had to their accounts affect the way you think about race in the U.S what are your experiences\nWere winning hundred for two three eight to five five ... hundred for two three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio still with us from Chicago is a ... a member an organizer with good kids mad city\nChaos Heinz she's program coordinator at leaders igniting transformation Milwaukee and dimitrius downward a member of a million ... movement for justice I first want to do to take a call from Tampa, Florida I'm Michael you're on the air\nYes sir um first of all hello and thanks for taking my call Yes sir I'm\nI get I'll give credit and and praised to let you for doing what they're doing but I'm uh fifty eight year old black man and this is what the North America and I don't think it a ... matter of fact it seemed like it got worse to Seventy to be honest with you\nWhat's gotten worse and Michael\n... the the the racial profiling and the tension between the rate that I mean look we got we got Donald Trump the law that the the attitude and the mentality of\nWhere the state of mind as you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws and second and everything and that mentality and psychological profile is still on the fourth today\nThank you so much for your perspective Michael I appreciate it very much dimitrius downward you focus a lot in your group as I understand it and thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's there's a line in in the movie where star Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically\n... he's in her corner but at certain point he says door you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that how do you approach thinking about uh how how you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face um I think there's respect we need\nWhen I was Thirteen I had to experience will stop and frisk and picked me to have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like fear for police can you tell me about\nTo meet you can you tell me a little bit about what that incident with like oh it was like what happened\nIt was scary I was walking around my block hey how's it going to build into building trying to find a friend and then do it like these two policemen and following me so I started like kind of walking fast because that was kind of scary and um they called me around the corner and they start to check my and go to see if I had drugs or anything and\nI had twenty dollars because at my parents and having to pockets and I was just shaking the whole time and they say well you scared I was like\nThis never happened to me before so the next two years every time I caught like Cruz by me oh we as a shake up though do\nYeah I mean it you know look I Lived in New York and have for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among the people who make policies in laws about stop and frisk\n... you know is about this issue but it kind of takes away from the human element right like this are you acted not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nIn the same neighborhood for years so it could start growing relationships with them it's just not have a new police or say every month or week like we just started growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and he has the same idea and we're like we have a conversation sometimes and I think\nThat that should happen they ship place police officers and the same neighborhood\nAnd there have been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has been a ... you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood majors yes yeah\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a Jeremiah Harvey he's a nine year old\nWho was a falsely accused of sexual assault a I Believe in Brooklyn New York uh when his backpack brushed up against a woman in the corner store or the woman Theresa Klein is white she called the police and has since apologized but your mind his mother told good morning America that lake like dimitrius they can't shake the incident\nIs so high because of how to play on my mind\nHow can I Can't think of this house in the world\nAre you concerned that this has permanently scarred Jeremiah yes I certainly\nWas devastated for him because even after walking away he was pointing to you know patrol cars on Flatbush Avenue and saying mommy are they here to take you away from us\nCare Heinz how much a or is this idea of living while black uh uh uh we've heard instances where a man was stopped from entering his own home or apartment building in St Louis because a white resident there didn't trust him although he lived there as well how much does this affect kind of your your daily rhythms in your life\nI think it affects me heavily because it it creates this constant fear that you walk around and you carry it creates when you when you drive you look out of you in here you see a police officer and even though you're doing everything right you immediately think what am I doing wrong\nAnd I'm just to add I'm listening to the video and the incident with the little boy it very much reminding me of the situation with him\nAnd how that affected him he and the tail had no idea what he had gone wrong and not at the little boy that it could happen to and they now he feels as if he did something wrong he feels as if he made a mistake or that you know something that is going to happen tennis actually young age and now\nCarrying around him so just growing up black and living up living in this type of situation create a constant\nUm amount of fear on you and a constant amount of worry anxiety and she got to carry around because you just never know what it's going to happen or what a small move it's gonna um how ... what was going to affect you it affect your life in the long run so\nYou're in the mood the heat you gives ... as I said earlier played by among Lester stern bird is a ... attends a mostly white school called Williamson prep a\nAfter her friend ... killed in a traffic stop by a police officer some students take the opportunity to school to go to a protest in this clip that we'll hear star reviews for friend Haley who's played by Sabrina Carpenter\nI just don't think it's you know he's the tuition as we just kept class how far it's not just going to class it's a good cause so happened to be a really good shoes to who\nReally don't want to hear messenger space that I knew\nYour school how would you guys called book talk on the heat you give up what kinds of conversations are problems with your white classmates did it sparked any any new thoughts\nUm actually I had two of them one of my freshman year and then one maybe last week the first one that I had with my freshman class actually did strike a conversation about\nWhat happened but it wasn't a I'm a growing conversation it was more so like my teacher talking and then people just kind of like one of the conversation to be over\nAnd then the one that I recently had um last week was kind of the same thing so none of them really sparked the major conversations um\nBased on what my teacher said to my classmates responding it just kind of made it awkward for me on my end because I noticed that as she was reading the book and talking about the situation everybody was kind of looking at me because I'm the only black student in the class\nAnd I'm In my school I'm known for talking about\nActivism and police brutality so it just kind of both times kind of gave everyone kind of gave me the fat and it didn't really bring up any heavy conversation so\nSo what would hope so you have for the movie theaters\nI really hope that after watching the movie people understand the frustration that we have\nBecause there's a lot of people in my school and a lot of people that I Know in general who um I have a best friend and she is really big on activism as well um and people look at us and they tell us that we are over being over dramatic that\nPolice officers are good that the person who was shot and killed shouldn't have done whatever they did um\nThat people now justifies the reasons why\nPeople tell us that we were being over dramatic were that were over thinking it or we need to let it go but I really hope but after seeing this movie and actually seeing this happens and seem to happen and seeing 'em the aftermath of the situation and not only on Starbucks\nOn her community out that seem that will allow them to understand exactly how we feel and I want them to be able to\nStop being closed minded and honestly being ignorant I Hope that that watching the movie allows them to be able to stand up and kind of fight against the problem with this", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
