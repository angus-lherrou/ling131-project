institutions failed or were on the brink there were scenes in American cities akin to what you'd expect to see during a bank run in a developing country\nStar game of money to pay their bills I mean there's one guy that's been here for eleven thirty last night I been here says five thirty this morning well\nThat was July two thousand eight and the voices of people waiting in line outside of IndyMac\nUh thirty two billion dollar California bank taken over by the FBI seeing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had taken over just three banks in two thousand seven but by two thousand ten that number had jumped to more than three hundred twenty banks that held more than six hundred and forty billion dollars in assets\nThat may be FDIC one of the most influential agencies in the government's recovery effort alongside the Federal Reserve and the U.S treasury\nThe woman running the FBI see at the time she lived there the Kansas Republican was appointed to the post in June two thousand six by President George ...\nYears until two thousand eleven will a decade after the financial crisis what does she live ... see now the FDIC was created in Nineteen thirty three to restore

system and she joins us now from Washington Welcome to on point\nThank you thank you for having me well you know I Know a from reading about your career that you first started paying attention to subprime mortgages back in\nTwo thousand one and two thousand two but I I see here that it was in two thousand what six as soon as you you came on board at FDIC that you actually asked uh your colleagues to buy a database of subprime loans from a company called lone performance [laughter]\nWell I guess I'd been in academia for several years and had not been really a working in the mortgage area and a bit retained an interest in it and when I got back\nThe staff or as the FDIC were were already on top of this they're worried about it\nBut we couldn't really see what was going on because the these mortgages are being secured ties all of our reporting systems were geared towards assets aid in this case loans are actually on the banks books and and these\nFor mostly we're not even being originated by banks are the big banks were providing some support to the non bank originator is here we're doing this and helping them package them insecurities and sell them off so this was data that showed those original mortgages that\nThat's right and it showed what the underlying mortgages that were accurate fishing trust and and so\nWhen you took a look and when your colleagues at if you if you took a look I mean what did you see where are you concerned yes Weaver stoppage [laughter] I couldn't believe\nWhat I thought oh my gosh so as as you noted in your introductory remarks ah my history this goes back to the early ... thousands where we're seeing this kind of abusive lending but it was really ... it was a marginal you know players in the mortgage industry that we're doing it

the FDIC from two thousand six to two thousand eleven\nAnd we're talking about the role that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation played in a the financial crisis in getting the nation out of it and what she lived there sees now when she looks across the financial system or whether she sees a healthy system or not and she lived there\nJoins us from Washington today uh she live there's a story that you tell in your two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns if it's it's it's a story that the very beginning of the book and it's just\nIt's so telling us how hoping you could read if you could share it once again with us and it's it's a story about um how you in two thousand eight in October two thousand eight you attend is very key meeting at the treasury with Hank Paulson\nAnd I believe what a seven of the top CEOs of the biggest financial institutions in America\nRight yeah well that was um [noise]\nThat was quite a quite a meeting it was false and they called it I was there ... there Tim Geithner was there the head of the other banking regulators or were there\nAnd um the purpose of the beating was basically for us to tell the banks that uh we were going to take some interventions and that we wanted them all to participate there is is that there was a you know the ... the court center piece of it was the tarp capital investment yet are going to\nPut under the veins of dollars into new capital into these banks are the FDA she was going to start within limits and for the we're going to start a year and she uh the debt that they needed to shoot you roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own debt\nAnd then the fed had trillions of dollars of learning disabilities that they\nThey put into place and so it ... it was basically explained this new programs\nAnd uh they had to take the ... well yeah you know and as I say that I think a lot of that was a was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city I think most of them not all but most of them probably could have bumble through\nBut show we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you just singled out certain banks for assistance you're going to make them look bad you know exacerbate their problems right so that yeah that was the reason why\nI got to just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about I think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight ... you say you know this was a meeting of Monday October thirteenth do those neat you say\nAnd I should know right nine men [laughter] ... not really [laughter] ... some and thereby treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars in assets or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system\nAnd then you're right I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there was even balance of power and\nAnd I still think we suffer from that that uh you know who works for you does it just doesn't work for the banks are you know or did just that the banks the banks and the safety net the get FDIC Deposit Insurance and fed access and all that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fulfill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these government supports Deposit Insurance can can incentivize a risk taking and too big to fail\nDish really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power and it was a turning it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't want look up look like I was awake legs so uh you know I think that some of them told me they're afraid of me I don't know if there that's a joke [laughter]\nI Can't I Can't\nBe little direct at times I Will be the first to admit that but I I just think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge\nAnd well I mean I just I I'm I Am so the numbers of looking at them descendants written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me\nNine trillion dollars in at at at Seventy percent of the U.S financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and two interconnected to feel that we had well\nIt it it is and whether we fixed that I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously he and I have had our disagreements in in their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need\nMore bailout tools and I think that's absolutely the wrong system that is a system we still have that we don't want to say it that system you would let things go down now oh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have an in two thousand eight and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed\nTo you know put it back into a resolution process to break it up you know keep his bad assets out impose a losses on the shareholders and the and secured creditors which is where the lawsuit should be and where the losses are also if you go through traditional bankruptcy\nTo fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the break you know and and you're bringing new investors new management\nTo an end in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process there is a mute unique\nThings about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to you is that is a tool we didn't have until tonight we have now the regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind the markets that this this is going to be the new paradigm this is the due process not bailouts but accountability\nAnd you can you know of course so many questions you live there because I I I'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist I'm not ... no no no I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis\nI mean it was the London I think the banks are too big already won a boy you know well\nI can understand that view and uh I don't think there's a political will ah in Washington to do that I mean and this is bipartisan unfortunately you see legislation going through now the reduced uh three the largest banks have reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this bill that just passed\nAnd in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress testing requirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say because I'm a Republican and I thought ... you know Republicans are market oriented\nA lot of Republicans trying to pressure the federal reduced capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter]\nThat's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else in in my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThey finally happens but yeah I mean if they need another bailout again I think ... our democracy cannot survive that and if they think say then again she lived her I said I don't our democracy cannot survive another round of bailouts it just it can't\nLook look at what happened you know people who discount the role that you ... snake crisis and an event you know the eight million homes lost nine million jobs lost you know the the terrible hit to the public purse still people struggling and lower middle income families um\nThat started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... in ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's in the discontent we have right now so to suggest that we're going to bail out so yeah that that's going to be the new paradigm\nThat we don't really need to bother regulation trying to prevent crises we just need to be repaired with more taxpayer bailout tools I don't think democracy is going to tolerate that\nWell you know so okay that's quite a bracing thing that you said and yet ... of the speaking with you and other people who were very key to the uh in the two thousand two thousand nine period ... any financial observer most people say we probably will have another crisis though so how ... square with our democracy yeah well\nIt's a if it well like I said you're hearing different things in different people [laughter] I'm not I don't know that we're going to have another crisis I I I think we but what I think we should be doing now that we are towards the end of the cycle\nWe should be preparing for the next downturn in economic cycle if banks have enough capital and stable funding to continue functioning when\nThe economy turns you know in their credit losses go out that's what happens in a downturn if they have a there was a it to continue functioning and continue lending we will have a downturn we will not have a crisis we will have a deep recession it's all about how we see the financial system is which is why now\nThose if they're worried about a crisis it shouldn't be calling for more bailout tool they should be calling for banks to be reserving more capital\n...\nSupport for on point comes from the listeners have W.

today\nThe answer around two thousand and why are they they're well to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote\nAs long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran\nSo listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lives it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is ... rent for he is a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me\nAll right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by the we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\nIt seems to be kind of a more over um way to say that the prior U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern scary in order to fight ISIS is being expanded\nSo the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including secretary of defense Mattis\nThat us troops are only fighting ISIS however they do ... secondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country are both in kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is\nHence the condition for us to withdraw is ah the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters that waste\nRight so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey ... uh the state department special representative for Syria\nA following John Bolton comment said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission again until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right they're they're counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers all ... and I'm its affiliates and those who hire Harvard al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq\nAnd so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that the way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to quote it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say\nWell you know it also balances against Iran such as a secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... raise cows description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region\n[noise] well\nI think people in the thing that the price by the second one coming out against you learned that we've seen yet because as you and then a few months ago um ... said the chips were going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would be ... by the end of the yeah\nAnd most of the regional palate all involved in Syria that she's Russia Jackie\nI'm no everyone else in the neighborhood and being expecting he likes to go and they can practically to punish the ... the idea that that actually going to be getting I mean definitely definitely puts them back like\nIn the picture when it comes to negotiate an end to this area and more and I think it should be on our Web that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric\n... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be hell to pay\nWell the very next day on Wednesday of less meat week some lawmakers did question of the U.S military role in Syria and this expansion of the military\nObjective they question Robert camera andme assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and here you are going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton\nPressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission in fighting ISIS\nProblem is that national security adviser John Bolton stated that the United states intends to keep an indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces\nThat to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran especially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of a wrong not actions of ISIS\nAbout this because it seems as if what ... saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria in the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that [laughter]\nSo he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're in the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria\nMeans that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they I don't think any real administration has shown a willingness to ah get a new authorization for use of military force a I mean that's a question of the OSCE been brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against ah the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks\nSome people think that those aren't covered by a either a UMF from two dollars in wanting to having to\n... know Liz Sly me in the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said\nWe'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to ... to stability and peace in the middle east in the region and to that effect you\nToday you just went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show the Israelis it wasn't a missiles like can you can you tell us a little bit more about that\n[noise] well yes I'm\nAt the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture\nI spoke to cough that he was a shock to like Jim age and with the ... hours on ... ... to ... sites that\nWhen his ... supposedly storing all manufacturing Mikhail to be which could be used to when Israel such gate the Lebanese fine ministry invited ambassadors with all the countries to them but she was in Europe and then\nI'm going to go and visit she's our people to fight to see that they don't contain any missiles\nSo what we did was we went to flexible we went to the Gulf Coast but that was the part on steak and we shouldn't laugh so then they put you back on the buses and we went to a sports club where we were ... and ... and other sports type stuff\nAnd then we went to a White House that was kind of and she ended with designed to show us the tennis ball it's not in fact storing it in his house in the site so it was very hot chow\nFrom the very simple picture pitch on Netanyahu flashed up at the United nations exactly why these sites where anyway and um it's where it was very hard to tell if we were in the same spot so much and that ... and he didn't see any Michelle's\nOh OK so a bunch so regarding for example um\nIsrael's response to the United states starting to talk about a more permanent or at least indefinite presence in Syria certainly they must be supporting this\n[noise] yes it's a story of a more hostile us more and more such if us

author and contributing editor for the national journal Stuart Taylor it's good to have you as well nice to be here and hello do you\n[noise] um so I Want to start out actually with the voice of a Supreme Court justice because last friday on September twenty seven just the day after a Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt just so happened that justice Elena Kagan was speaking at a University of California Los Angeles law school for them\nNow or I should know I watched the whole forum it was an about an hour and a half long and Brett Kavanaugh was named was not mentioned ones are neither by Justice Kagan or by the UCLA moderator of the law school dean Jennifer ...\nBut I Want to play a bit for you both here anyway because I think it's as close as we are going to get to knowing what's inside the minds of justice is right now and there was this really interesting moment where demon who can ask Justice Kagan about the lessons that the justices had learned when they only had eight members on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia\nAnd Alina Kagan said the court has a real interest in preserving its institutional legitimacy and then she said this\nThe courts strength as an institution of American governance depends on it having a certain kind of legitimacy on people believing that\nIt is I'm not simply an extension of politics that it it's it's decision making has a kind of integrity to it that it's something different from what you find in the political branches\nKitty dot com appointments

... we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity and the public trust\nIn the United States Supreme court and whether or not the court itself is becoming more politicized overtime I'm joined today by Stuart Taylor he's author and contributing editor for the national journal Dahlia Lithwick is also with us She's court and law courts in a reporter for slate and host of the economic as podcast as well\nAnd I want to just go through a kind of a little walk through a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where politics definitely came into play a first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here's then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October\nTwo days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation knots to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a Robert Bork ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of\nThe politics involved in his nomination\nMost serious and was being injury and all of this is not for me nor is it to all of those who have stood vastly supported by nomination ... deeply grateful\nThe damage to the during the ... and the integrity of law and a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings\nThis is a certain for national disgrace [noise]\nAnd from my standpoint as a black American as far as I'm concerned it was a high tech lynching for upper the blacks\nWho in any way Jane suffering for themselves [noise] to do for themselves to have different ideas and it is a message that unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen to\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland of who President Obama nominated and um we can't play any tape there because he never even got a hearing so that takes us then to where we are now two thousand Eighteen and just last week present a Brett Kavanaugh defended\nHimself before the Senate Judiciary committee are claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hair fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen elections\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo it with WIC hoping your phone lines but have you with us now yeah I'm here great ... thank you so much so\nThrough history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\nI you know I think it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically a mistake when he talked really in Folsom clear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork a\nAnd learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with\nVery very very extensive legal records\nUm records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of their actual dot ... views\nStanding up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no views balls and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork with the last time we had anything close to a truthful\nScrutiny of someone's record now what we have is that funny pantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote in the past has any bearing and I think that sets up\nA what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent\nDoctrinal record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now that doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money in the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that\nBut I think at least Bork was honest and he was\nWhen the Senate exercised it's advise and consent it did so knowing yeah that's gone\nWell Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that the naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process the proceeds any justices elevation to the high court\nEmphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight to zero I think or maybe it was and then you get to\nA I think it was ... or ... I don't understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them on almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was true\nOr everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can argue it's almost impossible to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe where the Democrats did was a Bork and and what made worker blurb\nWas they smeared him\nIn every conceivable way except as sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know the uh this is how they thought they could win now was Thomas was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all those all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee\nOr he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nIt's pretty public that every one of those judges\nOr or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe a margin him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleagues\nWho are you know who was much more conservative than most in some of them in some ways but he was an excellent tone yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person was on TV the other day was totally out of character for a cabin or in this process I think drove them after a\nWhile and and and a ... week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans\nIn those hearings themselves but also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants the nuclear option or ... the nuclear option button in two thousand Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees and two thousand Seventeen that removed you know what was the most effective\nBreak in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here in creating this highly politicized environment for the court\nI don't think there's any question I think that the fact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality\nOf this seat rests on one or two people's votes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that you know justices Ginsburg and Justice Scalia often a say or set in ... case look this is to be a Ninety eight nothing seems to be a Ninety four\nNothing enterprise because of the rule that everybody adhere to in the Senate was\nElections matter and if the president chooses someone who's fit we don't go after them because of\nPerceived outcomes and that's clearly just gone\nI Would probably say that the the holding of Merrick Garland seat open and in fact\nI Would say the running on the proposition right because Ted Cruz and John McCain ran in the twenty sixteen election for their Senate seats on the open promised that we will keep that seat open not only is Merrick Garland not getting a hearing but if Hillary Clinton wins we will hold the seat open for\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering cola guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test that can be

one eight hundred nine four seven auto\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity\nAnd the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by Dahlia Lithwick Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is for the last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything and this record\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old\nThis uncertain time place date and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans cost this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm you better watch out for your nominates\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the recent quote hysteria is because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American Life now\nOur political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous thing\nAnd by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues to introduce legislation that ... lifetime tenure for the judiciary because if they're just fall additions than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat's Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break I had to interrupt you there so that we could take that break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court doing its actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think you know the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception\nOf the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation the justices view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas never fully recovered from what he thinks we've done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said\nHis hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that\nIf Brett Kavanaugh's elevated to the court he will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justice is\nA perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do you have to factor\nIn conversation I'm going to get some callers here because we've got folks have been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just wanted to ask you a quick question here because\nUh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting are just records in the decisions that they make that perhaps\nI don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we\nHad justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived a preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated then they put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true but it's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs a nominee for the Supreme Court politics play a role as always played a role in some sense and also say\nIf you look at the American people's attitude toward the court\nMost people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics at the politics is in place some sort of role in the court\nAnd people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institutions automatically its legitimacy is loss and no longer people are going to ... hours dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic I Want to get this is from almost be through it first of all of the the point of course is has the legitimacy of integrity or public trust but a lot of\nThe perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a a justice to repeal replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public side now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a pop listen modern history and so through the media and through a lot of other things\nThey are uh giving a perception of what is and what not but to the last several months Donald Trump and his\nA blatant disregard for\nFor for the constitution and Republicans with this don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats in law\nI think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limited on terms now because this is simply a political position well\nErin thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one side they're about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with justice is\nWell I think term limits as a wonderful idea I thought that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen because it would require is maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress or the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be\nTerms or later is it going to help the the red team of the blue team and they're always be a calculation were of one side's thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing that neither side is gonna care much about than heron merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years\nUm but that's what's going on I think that's what we're going to be seen for ... for a long time well let's go to\nTroy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy\n... thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken for Obama and the ah keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court's role is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that was he's going through [noise] thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the air Joe\nI I'm I guess what I figured that law called the ... the if the Supreme Court and the question was going up or go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justices weather and I got the right to marry my partner\nAnd now I'm kind of thing that play out an area where\nThere's a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more playing down to um uh what the right is actually just a code word for religious so it's a bunch of religious people on the right who want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard\nThey still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything to be able to give me get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there was no scientific reason new ah prohibits gay people are married it's just about what religious doctrine is actually going to sway it matches that the\n... yeah well Jill thank you for your call a deli it looks like you have a response to that [noise]\nYeah I mean I think Joe just gave us the answer to Stuart subject Gina Stewart\nCorrectly makes the point that the Supreme Court has inserted itself into all the big ticket issues of the day [noise]\nExcuse me and I think you know what you just heard was the Supreme Court was by design supposed to be a counter majority Italian check it was supposed to fight for their rights\nOf minorities or when the other branches of government may have wanted to impose their will on ... that's what ... what is that what brown v board was\nUm and it's very very hard to say oh we want the court to stay out of the big ticket battles the hot button social issues because in some sense the court is really the only defense or for people who seek to have those kinds of rights affects you waited so it's very very hard to say um that you know that shouldn't matter\nSupport for Rhode Island public radio includes ... school providing opportunities for

definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for found that rough there if you will always out next year I've met a few of them over the years and I kind of make a swift exit if I get Qunu by somebody tells me they do it for fun I\nYou know the hunting in your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still is that if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia a dig a hole\nIn the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it and the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole actually condense a underneath the the plastic and\nDrip into a cup and you say you stay here if you you earn eight in the whole before setting up the still moist junior year and will condense into clean drinking water well why don't you knew that\nThat you could the thing is if you're really de hydrated\nDrinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you just into pure waste product\nSo if you can make a certainly still like this you have the you have the the resources to do that\nPaying into the bit around that you're gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you're you're going to get fluids out of that but if you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in a survival situation for example you call it breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrate said you don't want to be paying out those fluids because actually if you pay as clear\nThat that can actually help hydrate you so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways maybe paying onto your clothes and wrapped around the head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know and he he's a little things about the bunch of dogs I mean it was my love looking back on it because what if it was a crew the guy I bet you stink for the next few days we're moving into my ... just wrapped around my neck you know on the head scarf of pay and [noise] you know but he said let's see if it's about whatever it tell you who's in it\nSince you mentioned your crew I've always wondered I mean how ... your crew was there with you with their equipment having to go through the same terrain as you are I mean how how how much do you ask of them in terms of er of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing\nI'll tell you what they are they're incredible they really are they're being with me from day one small team\nYou know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thing can hype about them is true you know they always say hey bet you have the easy job we're going to do everything you do the back woods\nCarrying a camera you know and it should be under no illusion they are incredible and they work the hardest\nAnd the the real unsung heroes and the whole story\nAll right well we're speaking with bare grills he is host of running wild with their grills and of course man versus wild he's got a new book out called\nHow to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any

conveniences thanks\nYeah interesting yeah I mean the out take lives in one of the most forgiving environments um you know I've done by sea out to many times you know so I haven't talked to ... the

with Baird grills he's got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation and there before the break we heard from college Steve who was former navy special forces out here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous SERE training and he was talking about how\nUm as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've\nEver experienced a similar challenge or had gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and hey couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now yeah nice\nFestivals they respect feel service and a lot ... a guy who ran in the food is you know by Sally Ride the battle for survival is one and lost in the mind um the sea of training is something I went through\nIt is long it is oh you should it's tough and the time on your own ... I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five ...\nWe're into this you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks and I she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how easy it is is a lone survivor to look up to yourself and again you know when we're now as a crew you know when we were filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands if you need it you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed to put a first on that well you do you know the ...\nThe everything on your own to send my child that but it's all so busy you know I just remember that see a training I went through to the days on All right it was just doing to a doctor and the sea collecting firewood repairing the setting snap as doing that\nAnd by the end it's like yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's a mental Saudi you got to keep yourself up beat you gotta keep thinking like you know\nI always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind going to neutral is always something to be doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on the road I I think it's three times harder than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere is one of the things that Steve had said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from you because then I actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he ... he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was thinking he's\nReally highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I'm just wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on Sallie Mae spending three hours trying to live to five but as often the reality of a sudden in the old days on the ... wild shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing that so you know hours and hours setting ... obviously that's just going to make a really boring program you know I guess edited down and ... you know it's a bit of music and ... guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why set right at the start of the show survivor summed up three was never give up his or about that and that's the spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why\nRules where we've got to do get that determine you know next Saturday to\nThe Berlin the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick right here for by the way to wrap it for\nA few people [laughter] that's going to be no one do you love food team found that ... yeah I I'm not saying that Seventy says we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave with nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm everything themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like ... showing that they like stream weight loss said and that is the reality of survival is yet you're starving you dehydrated frightened you wet your cold and ... and\nYou know and that's why it's it's it's it's very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell speaking of the the glamorous part of survival and do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answers that we can get through a as many of them as we can hear okay so\nI've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation it's vital situations how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why couldn't I be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind to attract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] I mean they've actually talk about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff you know so\nUm but on the whole ... you're not getting the ... by the failures then you next time I go back to ... to ... that one again\nRight so I get ... wanted to know how often is buried guessed wrong and adjusted a poisonous planter animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super caffeine in the ... you are in need make big mistakes once and when it comes to you know poison things I've funky mushrooms and then ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt don't eat it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then you know I mean look at that story from Alaska was that one side great film you know the other end of the wiring the Alaska decided in the ... and I had a baby coming on your I go around and ran to get it wrong one Saturday\nYeah by the way if you haven't heard from folks haven't rented Jon Krakauer original book it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\n[noise] well hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but I actually in the little tweak of an actress of a good thing she's going to snap in the wild and she's also disliked made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity [noise]\nUm and actually some of them have the guns the guy with a [laughter] a vast who was impressive to see him throughout\nAll right one more a lightning round here question Sam Winston on Twitter or start on our website says there can you do your classic

the national journal Stuart Taylor good to have you as well nice to be here and how do you\n[noise] um so I Want to start out actually with the voice of a Supreme Court justice or because last friday on September twenty seventh through just the day after a Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee\nIt just so happened that justice Elena Kagan was speaking at a University of California Los Angeles law school for them\nNow or I should know I watched the whole forum it was an about an hour and a half long and Brett Kavanaugh his name was not mentioned once uh neither by Justice Kagan or by uh the UCLA moderator of the law school dean Jennifer ...\nBut I Want to play for you both here anyway because I think it's as close as we're going to get to knowing what's inside the minds of justice is right now and there was this really interesting moment where a demon who can ask Justice Kagan about the lessons that the justices had learned when they only had eight members on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia\nAnd Lena Kagan said the court has a real interest in preserving its institutional legitimacy and then she said this\nThe courts strength as an institution of American governance depends on it having a certain kind of legitimacy on people believing that\nIt is I'm not simply and an extension of politics that it

just go through a kind of a little walk through a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where\nPolitics definitely came into play a first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here's then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October\nTwo days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation not to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a Robert Bork ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of\nThe politics involved in his nomination\nMost serious and lasting injury and all of this is not to me ... to all of those who have stood vastly supported by nomination after Omar I'm deeply grateful\nThe damage to the ... and the integrity of law at a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearing\nThis is a circus so national disgrace\nAnd from my standpoint as a black American as far as I'm concerned it is a high tech lynching for upper the blacks who in any way Jane to think for themselves to do for themselves to have\nBut unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen to\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't plenty tape there because he never even got a hearing so that takes us then to where we are now in two thousand Eighteen and just last week\nPresident Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee are claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hair fuel to the parents turn up anger about President Trump and the two thousand six gene or watch and\nSee or that has been unfairly stoked about more judicial record revenge on ... for the Clintons and millions of dollars for money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo it this week hoping ... you with us now yeah I'm here ... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\n... you know I think it it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically a mistake with the top two really in Folsom clear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork\nA and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with\nVery very very extensive legal records\nUm records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of their actual dot ... views standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot\nA I have no views balls and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork was the last time we had anything close to a truthful\nScrutiny of someone's record now what we have is this funny pantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote in the past has any bearing and I think that sets up\nA what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent\nDoctrinal record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now that doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money and the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that\nBut I think at least Bork was honest and he was\nWhen the Senate exercised it's advise and consent it did so knowing yeah that's\nGone we'll Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that the naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process the proceeds any justices elevation to the high court\nEmphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and getting worse and worse and worse since before a judge Bork ... a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety\nOh I think was euro uh Bork and understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them and almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was true\nAh everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can hurt you know it's almost impossible that be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe what the Democrats did was a Bork and and what made worker bird\nWas they smeared him\nIn every conceivable way except a sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know that this is how they thought they could win now which Thomas was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all of all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee\nA he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nI have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges\nOr or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe a admired him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleague\nWho uh you know who is much more conservative than most and some of them in some ways but he was an excellent Cali yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person was on TV the other day was totally out of character\nFor a cabin or in this process I think a drove them after a\nWhile and and and a ... week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans\nIn those hearings themselves but also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants to nuclear option or push the nuclear option button in two thousand Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees in two thousand Seventeen that removed you know what was the most effective\nBreak in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here in creating this highly politicized environment for the court\nI I don't think there's any question I think that the fact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality\nOf this feed rests on one or two people's votes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that you know Justice Ginsberg and Justice Scalia often a fair set in ... case look this is to be Ninety eight nothing seems to be in Ninety four\nNothing enterprise because of the rule that everybody adhere to in the Senate was\nElections matter and if the president chooses someone who's fit we don't go after them because of\nPerceived outcomes and that's clearly just gone\nI Would probably say that the the holding of Merrick Garland seat open and in fact\nI Would say the running on the proposition right because Ted Cruz\nAnd John McCain ran in the twenty sixteen election for their Senate seats\n[noise] support for on point comes

making a trucker body we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity\nAnd the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by Dahlia Lithwick Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is for the last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on the Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything in this record [noise]\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place date and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans\nJustice happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm [noise] you'd better watch out for you or nominates\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the recent quote hysteria is because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nHave a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court and American lifestyle are political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous thing and ...\nColleagues introduced legislation that hands lifetime tenure for the judiciary because if they're just fall additions than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat's Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break ahead to interrupt you there so that we could take a break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court and doing actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception\nOf the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation the justices view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas\nNever fully recovered from what he thinks was done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving are forgotten how his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that if Brett Kavanaugh's elevated to the court\nHe will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justice is\nA perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do have to factor\nInto the conversation ... I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks who've been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just want to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there any evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting or just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps uh I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we\nHave justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived a preferred vote of the president that in the nominating them and put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true there is also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene as nominees and the Supreme Court the politics play a role it's always played a role in some sense and also say\nIf you look at the American people's attitude toward the court\nMost people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics but politics isn't placements or on the court\nAnd people often times do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some way to political institution automatically\nIts legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to fall as dictates\nWell let's go to calls here finally and thank you for were for waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get to see from almost be through it first of all of the the point of course is has the legitimacy of integrity or public trust for the last\nTwo perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a or justice to repeal replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a popular in modern history and show through the media and through a lot of other things they are uh giving a perception of what\nThe last several months Donald Trump in his\nA blatant disregard for\nFor for the constitution and Republicans with this don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law I think the public trust has been\nShaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limited on terms now because this is simply a political position well\nErin thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one side they're about from the from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with\nJustice is well I think term limits as a wonderful idea I thought that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen\nBecause it would require is maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's ... who's people or older you know who's terms or later is it going to help the red team of the blue team\nAnd they're always be a calculation where if one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um but that's what's going I think that's what we're going to be seen for ... for a long time well let's go to\nTroy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy\n... thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken for Obama and the uh keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court's role is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that was he's going through thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the Joe\nI I'm I guess what I figured that\nLaw called the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the question was going up or go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justices weather and I got the right to marry I or go\nOn and now I'm kind of seeing that play out a gang where\nThere's a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more playing down to um the ... the right is actually just a code word for religious so it's a bunch of religious people on the right who want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard\nThey still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything\nTo be able to even get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there is no scientific reason you are prohibits gay people are married it's just about ... what religious doctrine is actually going to sway the massive\n... yeah well Jill thank you for your call a deli it looks like you have a response to that [noise]\nYeah I mean I think Joe just gave us the answer to Stuart subject Gina Stewart correctly makes the point that the Supreme Court has inserted itself into all the big ticket issue the the day [noise]\nExcuse me and I think you know the way you just heard was the Supreme Court was by design supposed to be a counter majority Italian check it was supposed to fight for their rights\nOf minorities or when the other branches of government may have wanted to impose their will on joined he's that's what ... what is that what Brad\nTo say oh we want the court to stay out of the big ticket battles the hot button social issues because in some sense the court is really the only defense for people who seek to have those kinds of rights affects you waited so it's very very hard to say um that you know that shouldn't matter", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city":
