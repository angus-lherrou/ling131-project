hour with Dale Earnhardt junior he is a retired NASCAR driver or one of the most popular drivers in NASCAR history to time winner of the Daytona five hundred he retired with twenty six wins in the NASCAR cup series\nAnd he's the author of a new book it's titled racing to the finish my story and it's the story of all the concussions he suffered as a NASCAR driver what if they if they had on his life and what he did to heal himself\nAnd why he's speaking out about concussions and NASCAR as well we've got an excerpt of it at one point radio dot org or not no deal before the break we were talking about that really hard hit that you took on the tire test in in twenty twelve or in Kansas\nAnd I want to play a little bit of sound of releasing this very significant race it happened not long after that at Talladega this is kind of the book into the big hits that you took\nThat scared me straight as you were saying uh a little bit earlier so first of all let's listen to what happened in the last lap of the good Sam roadside assistance four hundred at the Talladega super speedway\nIn Alabama I'm there was a huge pack of cars there are in that last lap and here's what happened\nIn that last lap the cars are basically for deep they're going at two hundred miles an hour or if you haven't seen it or you don't remember it it's on YouTube and it is breathtaking to watch now here's Dale Earnhardt junior over the radio conversation with his crew chief Steve tart right after just moments after that Talladega crash\nEverybody [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] well so they'll tell us about that moment because I think it was after that are and how you felt after that that's what took you to go get help\nSo this was four weeks after the Kansas crash that had it been so so terrible for me\nAnd I had been suffering with the symptoms for those four weeks and I finally started to feel like my old self again coming into Talladega that weekend so there was a big big sense of relief from me but there was also\nA sense of fear because of Talladega they have these big PACs our cars and when there are those type of crashes as they're they're impossible to escape\nSo now we're very high for that particular weekend\nSo I was very nervous about that I'll I wanted was to be able to get through that race clean with no problems and I felt like I'd be home free and um get I got involved in that crash in ... and during a crash cart tee ball on the side of the car and spun the car around and I immediately\nWent all the way back to having the symptoms that I had before and maybe even worse and so\nBut this was a different kind of injury the right because yeah who were like whipped around yeah so the ... this was instead of an impact you know direct impact this was a very quick fast spin\nAnd so I knew immediately something was wrong with me again and I was really angry about it a and very emotional unusually emotional for some reason and you can hear that in the in radio\nCommunication and uh that's something I typically probably wouldn't be having I wouldn't be really having that personal of conversation over the radio because it's something that the entire team in ... all the fans can here and have access to\n'em but in those moments when you're injured and you're not really in control of your emotions and your anxieties and all those things and so\nUm I ... I knew that through my through reading about\nConcussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you uh retired players are just so much content out there so many stories and I can't [noise]\nUm I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about lowering layering concussions together and having concussions very close together in a very short period of time and\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something um changed about choosing somebody couldn't correct well\nCan I just don't been here for a second because ...\nYou really you write about in the book about how right after that that crashed that did that second hit a Talladega as you were saying like you were ... more emotional less less restrained I mean\nNASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track a two hundred miles an hour but you see in the book that now I was just angry angry all the time that you drove your car back to the garage and ESPN had a TV camera there waiting on me\nBig pack of reporters wanting to ask you about the crash\nHe started talking and your eyes get why volume picks up in your face turning red and here's what you said\nI Can't believe that everybody now\nNobody's simple enough to\nRealize just how ridiculous that was the man was hey is ridiculous if that's what we did every week I wouldn't be doing it I'll just put it to you like that [noise] this is how he writes ever wake I'd find out a job it's bloodthirsty if that's the only people that that was the lone Lance ridiculous\nI don't even want to go day tolerance ... next year but I got much choice it's really not rice and I don't know it's just is it's all disappointing how that all went down as that goes like [noise]\nCosts a lot of money right there is this a lot of wasted I mean if this race and that's how we're going to continue to rise and nothing's going to change a NASCAR car's plays a lot of money\nDale Earnhardt junior\nOut of character be that um to be that aggressive I think was out of character for me\nAnd I could feel a mom oceans I'm In that moment you know sort of not knock it feel myself not being able to shut up you know not being able to buy my lip and and and keep those opinions to myself because they were going to do mean no good bye\nI'm sharing them and that in that environment and I did get some pushback from NASCAR about those comments to particularly the bloodthirsty comment and\nUm they weren't very happy with me and I know better than that you know I Know NASCAR will enough and and my intentions as in my career had been to try to lift the sport up and be a great representative for the sport and then that moment I was not doing that and I couldn't control it [noise]\nThat was the worst part about it in and um I could not control my emotions and and with that injury having just occurred and I dealt with that for the next you know forty eight hours a day trying to\nCalm down trying to make sense of what I was feeling I'm trying to figure out what I was going to do about it um and luckily I got pointed in the right direction to see a specialist in their surgeon to a that was local in Charlotte a doctor petty yeah\nAnd so that man got that right there was the saving grace for me because I don't know whether I Would have made the right decisions going forward to take care of myself\nHad not been put in front of the right people\nYeah so we got a lot of college and when I talk to you and I want to get to the right just a second here but but but let me ask you mean the way you write about are the kind of hits you took we we were talking about two big ones there but also there's a lot of ... and I'm putting smaller in quotes here has a NASCAR nothing's really small\nBut you know 'cause everything's going so fast I I just wonder like how many of your fellow drivers have had concussions how often do you think drivers are behind the wheel\nOr you know in these races with their uh you know not at a hundred percent because of the effects of of getting hit in the hand all the time\nI think it's very rare I actually do um I feel like that that crashed in two thousand twelve with an anomaly for me I feel like that it was a um you know just a unique\nStyle of accident and impact that not a lot of drivers will experience in their career um for the for you know for the majority of my career I never you know I never was\nHaving problems with a crash that would be Fifteen to twenty five jeez and that's a standard sort of impact for most crashes whenever you make contact with something it's anywhere from Fifteen to twenty five ... and most drivers will have their own\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a

suffered as a top tier NASCAR driver\nA he's a two time winner the Daytona five hundred Fifteen time winner of NASCAR most popular driver award and an earlier in the hour we talk in detail about two concussions that he suffered in two thousand twelve but those were not his first in the book Dale Earnhardt junior writes about how in Nineteen Ninety eight for example his car rolled in a race\nAnd his head hit the roll cages so hard that his helmet had put put a big dent into the bar that was in Nineteen Ninety eight crash\nAnd then in two thousand to April twenty eighth he crashed during the Napa auto parts five hundred at the California speedway infant panic California\n[noise] the way you can learn talk during the rescue personnel [noise] knocked him right now they might give me they're doing with your brain job would be inside of these cars in the head and neck restraint and everything else [noise]\nGuy I think he's got the breath knocked out and play them again that's all it is\nYeah definitely that long pause that's what everyone hope that all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision and I felt like a ... than in the car was the only thing that really could help me decide ah [noise]\nYou know exactly how bad the situation was or how long I needed to get better so I Know better next time I should've kept a secret as much as I did but um [noise] you know I didn't want to cause too much alarm because it really wasn't as serious I guess is everybody has made it out to be\nDale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two well joining us now is Michael Mickey college he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program and he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior\nThe more words for a racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to on planes\nHigh maintenance or it's really great to have you because obviously as as Diehl writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office I mean you treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes\nKnew what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\n[noise] well I've seen him shut deal twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale we actually got Dale better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw it Dale he was very sick or with these issues that we commonly see with concussion\nAnd quite honestly I I didn't care as much about Dale becoming a race car driver again I I Want a deal to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd I just jump in here though because I mean the the the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems on all the things I hand eye coordination all the things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving it two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life um you know ... racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar uh initially saw Dale\nAnd and you know we really identified will learn a lot about concussion and there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the average signals coming from and and matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with Dale and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and set amount of course of rehab that um that eventually got him better and and Dale is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nYeah so uh let me call and I think one thing that surprised me about what they wrote in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very very specific specific regimen of exercises and other protocol essentially that would\nPush his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when and brain is healing from from concussions\nI that's a common a perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment\nWe've actually identify now that there are six different types of concussions and there was some types of concussions were quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated\nBut in details profile of difficulties with the way you treat the problems that Dale had is actually ... training\nAnd so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach a whether the rate regulation or whatnot but\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again whereas the average single coming from and then and then matched the right treatment to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because\nThis is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous event if this if this thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nYeah we'll Dale Earnhardt junior and in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins\nThat you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver culture is like but you did hear from some drivers who had either previously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help\n[noise] yeah actually that was so interesting I guess I'm you know a hearing from retired drivers\nAnd suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and looking and just really just be able to contact Mickey had to get a Pittsburgh where he was in and see him [noise] um that was\nI think the beginning of the\nReason for writing this book and Mickey has told me time and time again\nOr whether it's an article someone's red or he's read or whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here and he'll tell you that he has people that come in every week that um connect\nUh you know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be open and transparent\nAs a result in this book and ah you know so that I I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's you know I've made friends by meeting strangers\nAnd directing them to Mickey and continuing to support them and continuing to you know encourage them through the process and not made some pretty good friends to sorry to interrupt\nYou there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Nikki college they said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that\nAre you are so concerned freaked out really about uh how much you were struggling after your your dual concussions in in twenty twelve but that he told you that it could be fixed now ... why did that was so profound feel\nThat you know he did that on a couple occasions I had I'll I'll I'll toss I'll talk about this one in particular I had my eyes were not working I'm not focusing not I couldn't they weren't stable\nIf I walked across the room they ever you know to buy the environment shook and I my eyes just wouldn't uh wouldn't settle and it was so so frustrating 'cause it it was there every minute of every day and it affected anything and everything you did\nAnd it was there for months it wouldn't getting better I was working and rehabbing and doing those doing exercises in homework that Mickey had given me and it wasn't\nChanging and ah I was getting more and more worried and so I called Mickey innocent Mickey I really just got to ask you something real quick and I said to have you seen this I problem and\nA cause a a patient's ... patients idea is that the doctor has to stay positive he's not going to be a negative person and tell you this isn't going to work and this is what you got a new you know he's going to be positive because he believes that he can fix it and\nI wanted to know for sure a Mickey of you seen this problem this exact thing have you heard someone to explain it exactly like I'm explaining it yeah I have and have you fixed it he says yes hundreds and hundreds of times I've fixed this and

action in university admissions is again on trial and an American court room a Massachusetts federal court is currently hearing a case that alleges that Harvard University discriminates against highly qualified Asian American students\nThe allegation is that the best and the brightest aren't getting in because Harvard uses race as one of many factors and its admissions process\nSo the plaintiffs once all mention of race removed from applications totally race blind meaning that this case is really about ending affirmative action the man behind the case has tried before and he's taken his argument all the way to the United States Supreme court in two thousand Thirteen where this current Harvard case\nIs very likely to end up as well so this hour on point affirmative action in higher

you see this case really as and and do you see any ... any evidence that Harvard\nOr discriminates against Asian Americans as the plaintiffs are alleging\nShore so as\nAn Asian American civil rights lawyer that fights discrimination and racism against Asian Americans every day in a variety of contacts of course I Would be concerned about discrimination against Asian Americans and Harvard's admissions process\nNow the claim here is intentional discrimination and while I Do see that there is some negative effect on Asian Americans in the admissions process based on the data that I have seen\nI Do not think that it is at all related to the consideration of race in the admissions process\nNor do I think that it is\nIntentional discrimination I think there is a disparate impact\nFor Asian Americans do two legacies and other preferences that predominantly a benefit white privileged applicants\nAnd I also don't think Asian Americans are alone and experiencing the disparate impact on of those policies but can I jump in here because I couldn't\nBecause the plaintiffs allege that they they see evidence in the thousands of pages of documents that have been released during discovery in this trial that they see evidence\nOf that of a either a disk of discrimination or at least biased against Asian American students in one of the four factors that are that Harvard uses in in admissions they you know they will get academics that look at extracurricular they looked at athletics and they look at um\nThis is this thing called a a personal which is a character and and it's an that personal category that they said ... harbor shows a pattern of\nMarking down Asian American students for for no real reason other than perhaps\nBias shore somebody address the personal score issue I think there's a number of things to consider about the personal score so first statistically\nThey're saying that Asian Americans are consistently rated lower on the personal score but that's because of how the Oregon they organize the data so they organize the data by academic\nPresent based on SAT scores and GPA\nAnd they're saying that\nOn the students and the highest exile who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups\nBut I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic ... because it doesn't necessarily correlate just because someone anyone Asian American or otherwise\nScores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic that's out there is no stick statistically significant difference\nOkay Peter would let me turn back to you in sort of a step back here for big picture because twice or in terms of when affirmative action has been taken all the way to the United States Supreme court\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight in the back of your case and in two thousand three and ... the ball injure Harvard's admission process these have actually been highlighted by the justices as the way to use\nRacial factors in admissions has the right way to ease racial factors in admissions and that it's not a deciding factor because\nUh there are many thousands of qualified applicants but it it could be a factor that used in in the entire mix here it was held up as as as the right way to do it so what's what's the problem now that you see\n[noise] well first of all the the ... case in Nineteen Seventy eight was fractured opinion the court split for for one one was Lewis Powell who was Powell was the only one who looked to Harvard\nAnd fought the its approach to diversity ought to be compelling no other justice agreed with him at the point that remained in the category of Supreme Court ducked the all the way to souls and three when in the ... case\nSandra Day O'Connor decided to resurrect polls eccentric opinion and make the law the land so now the U.S Supreme Court has not instance said that the the pursuit of diversity taking some code of racial preferences\nWould be a a suitable thing the colleges and universities could do not that they had to do it but that they could ... and that's where the law stands on this was reaffirmed in the Fisher case a few years ago\nOn what's at stake here is what's been at stake all along which is should the United states be a country that holds the law the land is titled six of the\nOf civil rights act like teen sixty four that no person in the United states show on the grounds with race color or national origin be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits to be\nA word to be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance as far as ending affirmative action we could say that Harvard does have other options\nYou could take the option of saying we no longer want to receive federal aid therefore we're willing to put our money aside in order to discriminate because we'd like to discriminate\nAnother option is that harbored which has a dome and meld thirty nine point one billion dollars could expand and manner that could accommodate students who are qualified and rightly belong in of students\nUh Nicole go into what you want to give you a chance to respond to that\nShort so I Do want to push back against um this notion that Asian Americans are definitively being discriminated against and I want to do that by sort of talking about the admissions process so I think it is a fiction that\nEvery other score or every other consider\nObjective and I think there's a lot of research that establishes that SAT scores and grades even extracurricular activities to some extent\nSystematically penalize black and Latino students um and some subgroups of Asian American students as well\nAnd so I think to sort of look at the admissions process and to look at the personal score as the only one that\nCould be potential Tobias it incorrect because all of these doctors are perfect all of them to some extent are vulnerable to implicit axles that bias in the case of SAT scores systematic discrimination against certain\nUm you know racial groups and so I don't think that the\nRemedy for any of this is to eliminate the consideration of race but it is actually to have race consciousness and a lot of scholars would tell you that the way to remedy discrimination\nIs to consider race and to make sure that these um that racial groups are treated unfairly compared to check\nOkay so I Want to take a step back here and actually bring in the voice of Harvard University itself because back in July uh I had a chance to sit down with Harvard president Larry back how right at the beginning of his his presidency at Harvard and\nWe had a long conversation linked to that whole conversation a at on point radio dot org but I'm going to play an excerpt here for you because I began by\nAsking Larry back out again Harvard's president about what he sees as the overall mission of Harvard admissions process and he is and what it should be an and here's what back out said\nThe admissions process should try to construct a class to bring together a group of students in a residential learning environment which optimize is the opportunity for them to learn not just from the faculty bought from each other\nAnd diversity is an important component of that because we learn from our differences\nAnd so we focus not just on a narrow definition but a broad definition of excellence the vast majority of students\nBecause we aren't just public radio we are the public radio\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from exact\nScience is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non

callers who want to join us let's go right to them Mohammed is calling from New York New York Mohammed you're on the air\nIf thanks for taking my call and high magna I really love your program\nI'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question at the end and it caught a common is that I'm In my career where I live here in New York City I worked in a new show\nFor my career I'm retired now and I see the school system in this city public versus the exceptional schools as apartheid structured\nAnd the other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that\nAre African Americans have like a ... a of a four hundred year deficit and pursuing I'm a equity in this country and that's reflected in our schools are going to most of the public schools in this in the city of New York\nOr you don't see Asian and white\nCivil how are you are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then to a level that feel to write historical inequities [noise]\nYes I yes I Do and I think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads in the sand or at Harvard ... less than fifty percent of the student body is is African American\nWell let me take it back to me on on on that point and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of uh voices we want to join us like very much appreciate your call oh let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on this morning all as far as affirmative action does you know I think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean yes if it wasn't for affirmative action some things would have never been able to say please\nBut their lives in in the race balancing but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all for the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida and maybe African American myself I went through some of his during high school and elementary school or I couldn't\nOver here because of what a million black students going over there\nAnd my sisters following through the same thing and and during the eighties early seventies would be very violent\nAnd I mean idle idle idle a little bit of a it's a double sided coin you know and as far as with Asian Americans with Harvard I think it has to do with the as far as a symbol of personal credit you need in order to get into the school\nA state that has to do with the fact ah from my experience of them a lot of your own experience I don't know about the Asian community they're not very inclusive of and so I think they may have something to do with the about the personal effects but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well\nFirst they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those\nOkay did you get back to ... a month thank you so much for your call Nicole gung ho chi let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a I mean uh uh did you is talking about his experience as an African American male or\nIn this country he also then sort of made some presumptions about the Asian American community as well I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that\n[noise] sure um yeah I mean I don't really agree ah with DJ that as a group Asian Americans are not very inclusive or you know are more about academics than um than anything else I think that is a stereotype and I think that\nKind of at stylish is why we need\nThe policies like affirmative action because our country is so segregated that people don't have the opportunity to interact with each other and to break down those stereotypes and that is\nOne of the points of considering race in admissions process and to have a diverse student body at in colleges is though that these barriers can be broken down and what you heard from ... it was probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions\nWith Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an apartheid system in our public\nSchools So Peter would let me turn back to you here because I just want to get down and I and we're going to I'm going to ask this question of Nicole as well but she's already spoken about how she believes diversity is is part of what's core to\nAn essential on a experience on American college campuses but if you were to have your druthers what would be the basis upon which colleges and universities in America admit students\nHe would have to admit students on the basis of proven ability aptitude determination self discipline the qualities that make for someone who can undertaker rigorous college curriculum and the full range of things that go on in college who lives in to the maximum are aren't the only\n... to determine it a determination et cetera aren't those are very objectively measured though\nWell they can be subjectively measured but there are certainly objective qualities involved in it as well students who do well in their academics through grade school and high school and who ...\nTranscript showing the booth excelled in the courses that are available to them and have gone beyond those courses or showing the determination that does not just a matter of somebody subjective opinion about it but it's actually illustrated in their lives lived up to the\nOkay because I keep going back to what Edward Blum the man who is really the force behind this case what he said it two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race in applications so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian plaintiffs now now Edward Blum has a long history of\nAgain bringing cases against affirmative action to the Supreme Court he also challenged the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder\nOr and and won that case at the Supreme Court of ...\nShe's been focused on race a lot in America but but what I mean Harvard uses a athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why why should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with\nTheir merits there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against a students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean if you look there's a lot of other issues apart from race\nThat a separate that the haves and the haves and have not in the way Harvard admit admit students\nWell Harvard may be making ... decisions when it comes to the preferences gives for ... for people in ... but\nThose are decisions so the private university republic one for the murder or fried Meg\nSo why do they make the decisions also then based on what they see as a mix of students that they need to ... to have a diverse campus\nBecause this country passed a law through Congress signed by president ... numerous Supreme courts which is the title six of the um [noise]\nA Nineteen sixty four law and that just makes the planes the to this country discriminating on the basis of race is no go don't do you\nKnow if Congress were to pass a law that says the law into your preferences for athletes who would be strange law but no such law currently exists this is about Bain law\nI see okay so let's go to another call here Eli is calling from Steven city Virginia Eli you're on the air\nLike now I just wanted to call in because I think a lot of the narrative around this case has been saying that Asian Americans don't believe in affirmative action um a lot of people in the Asian community I Do believe in an affirmative action I'm an East Asian American Woman\nAnd the majority of the plaintiffs any cases are Chinese American students um and that\nYou know they're not under represented in the college scene and the flight us now from an action really helps black and brown students in America which Asian American students sometimes are considering ... to ... uh Pacific Islander\nOn South Asian Southeast Asian the ... you know if this is going to give them a leg up we

a recent article that you wrote a K ... when you begin quote it has felt practically inevitable for years that I'd have to write the following sentence fears holding court wants towering force in American moles that was a central and creating the blueprint for the twenty century retail\nIs preparing to file for bankruptcy\nWhy does it feel inevitable well\nBecause this is the result of a very very long slow decline and I sort of break it into two parts ah Sears in two thousand for a a financier named Eddie Lambert orchestrated it's merger with Kmart\nAnd that has been as quite disastrous chapter I she's mismanaged the company and a number of ways that I'm sure we can delve into in more detail and that has played a key role in bringing it to this point of bankruptcy but long before that throughout the nineties in the eighties\nSears the missteps for just piling up that left it not well positioned to compete in today's retail environment\nOkay so let's talk about some of those missteps because I think at first blush\nPeople when they see a major retailer or have to declare bankruptcy these days they think it's because they haven't been able to keep up with a you know online shopping and the the the major changes in the way Americans are shopping is that the case or I mean it sounds like you're saying that the missteps came along before Amazon came along\nYes exactly so we can we can relate to the Nineteen eighties when\nSears was sort of just cutting off of it is but I think of is it it's in puerile period that postwar post World war two I threw the seventies when it was in you know just this really dominant retailer and in the eighties I think it had a bit of hubris\nOn and it started to get distracted by adding different minds of business so it acquired Caldwell banker acquired a finance firm called dean Witter just started taking it off the ball of what it knew how to do best\nWas which was to sell people stuff\nAnd and then also some pre Internet changes started happening that Sears didn't quite know how to grapple with and that was mainly in the form of these so called category killers these big box paradise says\nLike Best Buy Home Depot Lowe's even staples id sort of large for net stores that specialized in one category Sears didn't really do a good job of adapting to those concepts such flourished in the nineties\nThis is the public

this hour about Sears declaring bankruptcy and what it means for retail in America in two thousand Eighteen the once dominant perhaps the dominant retailer in the United states for more than a century\nCan't hold on and it's going into chapter eleven we're talking this hour with Sarah ... actually the Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industries\nVicki Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of for main street tomorrow the rise and fall of the American department store\nAnd Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how fears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country now was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know yeah it's competition was Montgomery Ward also had a catalog and only Nineteen century\nUm but this was a a way that um rural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out\nOn railroad cars you know across the country and you could order\nEquipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded I mean as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard war in the years and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business did all that has allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these ... customers in rural parts of the country\nUm I mean I think they are they started out as a selling watches so it was just a sort of limited of for him in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board\nUm and he took the company into it sort of a modern day for um uh so I I think that this was\nThe gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between the rich and the poor are but you know it was a time of industrialization and I'm also movement into cities\nAnd a cyst growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also um wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it on other otherwise they would have had to you know travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was a ... about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street an entrepreneur um a sort of\nGoing it's small towns across the country and then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nWas Sarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets and opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as as Vicki Howard is saying also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many moles in America\nYeah I think in some ways a story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still Berlin agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns on and making that adaptation so quickly\nI mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores were the majority of their business compared to a\nTo catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and speed was mentioned even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think fears occupies such an important place in retailing history in Congress and\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with a series of shocked us years perhaps at least once in their lives so lots of lots of memories you know let's go to Deborah who's calling from Watertown, Connecticut Deborah you're on the air\nYes making great show I I'm I have worked for two great American institutions fears and potential um and potential continues to thrive and fears of course is not\nI started my fears when I was a kid during the Vietnam War um my father was military sergeant stationed in Japan so we ordered everything that we needed\nI Would pour over it for hours\nUm I think feared have been off to fight and heading for trouble for a long time I worked for years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school in house where um the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope you have kids here this he was the top housewares manager and the entire country\nVery aggressive he he wasn't there about knowing the merchandise send me an spying missions to see what other stores were charging so he could set prices in sales based on that information he had made cooking chicken and ham inside the store grilling it so that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love this he sounds like a really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted beyond manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know\nAnd I especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those days about\nI'm an old style manager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with the customer who wanted to order a replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard\nBut he was really really difficult and really unhappy and hard to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy was that his wife had left him\nAnd she had um [noise]\nTaken the parts but not the grill uh-huh and and I and I didn't I couldn't handle and when I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you\nAnd I hung up on it\nAnd he called store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never saw before who was a you know young man college educated worst suit\nCame down to you know get my head on a platter and John stuck up for me uh-huh he said she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat me down and he gave me you know the coffee yeah always right lecture but he stuck up for me\nWe'll Debra thank you so much for your call and for your memories there and and a really wonderful example about or perhaps how were qualified people that you weren't at least in this case weren't getting promoted thank you Deborah let's go quickly to Chris who's calling from state College Pennsylvania of course you're on the air\nA great program or what but not just ... a lot of these big corporations and the role of the vulture capital of coming up you know the hedge love the bodies corporation of a\n... to the hill to pay them so back to the purchase price of a trip all the assets all off in a larger dog with crash category although\nRan out of the authors pocket all Catholic now they're just going back and we're or a load the shell of a corporation and all the debt on somebody else\nI see Chris thank you for your call Sarah ... ah did that happen to seniors were they were they purchased by hedge fund or or a private equity business at one time\nAh so any land bird today who just stepped down as CEO and who orchestrated it's merger with Kmart he is a hedge fund guy\nOn and he has used a lot of those hedge fund tactics to try to keep here's a flow in recent years so and this is one of the main knocks on his tenure at is that he didn't really have emergence instinct he wasn't running series like a retailer he was running it was sort of his henchmen guy had on and so he is and\nYou know doing things like spinning off it's real estate providing loans are selling things like the crash into a brand sort of moving around financial chess pieces to keep it alive but he wasn't really making it a better retailer will\nShould we talk more about this then because we think the presumption when you hear the retailer goes into bankruptcy is that somehow they were doing business wrong but it may have nothing to do with that I mean as a as our caller pointed out we have so many examples Toys R us he's right is another one ... who's a hedge funds were private equity managers using these companies are as credit cards and then\n\nSupport for on point

mean by that because if you say your service technician and ... your your businesses as is as busy as ever\nUm yeah they don't have your you know what we're um Sears and the fact for sure oh are they in the center for applied to electronic because we do other I'm like we do\nUm flows Home Depot or rules um that's why we do all the service I see staples along with all the store\nYou know wherever wherever appliances sold redo the orange juice or\nDave I'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a Bloomberg opinion columnist David he's feeling confident lease for his part of Syria's business and he sees the company's coming full circle what do you think\nSo I think there's something to the fact that the services area is if if you had to call out some bright spots at Sears services would be one and that's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on that you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances with than\nBecause uh they have this relationship with you I had their services business so there is something to that that this idea than coming full circle\nI think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and look at the labor's been saying for years that Sears is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened\nThey keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of ... okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it it it actually maybe less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done on line and certainly I it it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent and categories like apparel it's probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty percent in apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even\nHere's couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing\nExactly and I think that's why yes this is definitely a story at Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story and Sears getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterparts I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's are those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nA best buy stock in your all time high as ... as it has staged a remarkable turnaround is taking share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off price stores like T.

Harvard shows a pattern of marking down Asian American students for for no real reason other than perhaps\nBias shore somebody address the personal score issue I think there's a number of things to consider about the personal score so first\nStatistically they're saying the Asian Americans are consistently rated lower on the personal score but that's because of how the Oregon they organized the data so they organize the data by academic dial which is Ninety nine percent based on SAT scores and GPA\nAnd they're saying that\nUm the students and the highest exile who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups\nBut I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic dial because it doesn't necessarily correlate just because someone anyone Asian American or otherwise\nScores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic die style than there is no stick statistically significant difference\nOkay Peter would let me turn back to you and sort of a step back here for ... big picture because twice or in terms of when affirmative action has been taken all the way to the United States Supreme court\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... case and in two thousand three ... three ball injure Harvard's admission process these have actually been highlighted by the justices as the way to use\nRacial factors in admissions at the right way to use racial factors in admissions that it's not a deciding factor because\nUh there are many thousands of qualified applicants but it it could be a factor that used in in the entire mix here it was held up as as as the right way to do it so what's what's the problem now that you see\n[noise] well first of all the the ... case in Nineteen Seventy eight was fractured opinion the court split for for one one was Lewis Powell who was Paul was the only one who looked to Harvard\nAnd fought the approach to diversity ought to be compelling no other justice agreed with him but the point that remained in the category of Supreme Court did go all the way to solve them through when in the early ... has\nSandra Day O'Connor deployed to resurrect polls eccentric opinion in ... so low yes Supreme Court house not instance so the the pursuit of diversity taking some code of racial preferences would be a suitable ... cold\nAnd that's where the last ... was reaffirmed in the Fisher case which ... years ago\nOn what's at stake here is what's been at stake all along which is should the United states be a country that ... law away um but I just played all six of the\nCivil rights act like teen sixty four that no person in the United states show on the grounds of race color or national origin be excluded from participation in order to nudge the benefits to be\nA word to be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial systems as far as ending affirmative action we could say the Harvard does help other options\nYou could take the option of saying we no longer want to receive federal aid therefore we're willing to put our money aside and in order to discriminate because we'd like to discriminate\nAnother option is that harbored which has a a dull moment meld thirty nine point one billion dollars could expand and manner that could accommodate students who are qualified and rightly long ... of the students\nAre Nicole gung ho what you want to give you a chance to respond to that\nSure so I Do want to push back against um this notion that Asian Americans are definitively being discriminated against and I want to do that by sort of talking about the admissions process so I think it is a fiction that\nEvery other score or every other consideration in the admissions process is objectives and\nI think there's a lot of research that establishes that SAT scores and grades even extracurricular activities to some extent\nSystematically penalize black and Latino students on and some subgroups of Asian American students as well and so I think to sort of look at the admissions process and to look at the personal score as the only one that\nCould be potential Tobias it incorrect because all of these doctors are in perfect all of them to some extent are vulnerable to implicit exquisite biased and the case of SAT scores systematic discrimination against certain um you know racial groups\nAnd so I don't think that the\nRemedy for any of this is to eliminate the consideration of race but it is actually to have race consciousness and a lot of scholars would tell you that the waiter remedy discrimination\nIs to consider race and to make sure that these um that racial groups are treated unfairly compared to the ...\nOkay so I Want to take a step back here and actually bring in the voice of Harvard University itself because back in July or I had a chance to sit down with Harvard president Larry back how right at the beginning of his his presidency at Harvard and\nWe had a long conversation linked to that whole conversation a at on point radio dot org but I'm going to play an excerpt here for you because I began by by asking Larry back out again Harvard's president about what he sees as the overall mission of harbors admissions process and is and what it should be an and here's what back out said\nThe admissions process should try to construct the class to bring together a group of students in a residential learning environment which optimize is the opportunity for them to learn not just from the faculty bought from each other\nAnd diversity is an important component of that because we learn from our differences and so we focus not just on a narrow definition but a broad definition of excellence the vast majority of students who apply our next Jordan\nJust public radio we are the public's radio\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is

federal court case against Harvard University we've got a lot of callers who want to join us let's go right to them Mohamed is calling from New York New York Mohammed you're on the air\nIf for taking my call and high magna I'd really love your program I'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question that in common is that I'm In my career where I live here in New York City I worked in a newsroom for\nMy career I'm retired now and I see the school system in this city public versus the exceptional schools as apartheid structured\nAnd the other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that\nLike a ... a ... for four hundred year deficit and pursuing I'm a equity in this country and that's reflected in our schools are going to most of the public schools in this in the city of New York or you don't see Asia and whites\nSo Mohammed how are you in are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then to a level that feel to write the historical inequities\nYes I yes I Do and I think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads in the sand or at Harvard ... less than fifty percent of the student body is is African American\nWell let me take it back to me on on on that point and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of voices we want to do and so I'm very much appreciate your call oh let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on all as far as affirmative action goes you know\nI think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean yes if it wasn't for affirmative action some things would have never been able to take place\nBut it isn't in the race balancing but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all for the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida and maybe African American myself I went to someone who is through high school in elementary school or\nI couldn't move this woman and right there in my community I have and the bus way over here because of what a million black students going over there\nAnd my sister's father went through the same thing and and during the evening late seventies where it was actually going to be very violent things within the church\nAnd I mean I don't I don't I don't know that I mean it says a double sided coin you know and as far as with Asian Americans with Harvard I think it has to do with the as far as like some of the personal criteria that needs to be in order to get into the school\nI think that it has to deal with the fact ah\nFrom my experience of them a lot of people to experience that I Know about the Asian community they're not very inclusive of and so I think they may have something to do with the about the personal effects but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well versed they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those others\nOkay did you take it back with you there um thank you so much for your call Nicole gung ho chi let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a I mean uh uh did you was talking about his experience as an African American male or\nIn this country he also then sort of made some presumptions about the Asian American community as well I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that\n[noise] sure um yeah I don't really agree ah with DJ that as a group Asian Americans are not very inclusive are you know are more about academic than um than anything else I think that is a stereotype and I think that\nKind of its tablet shows why we need\nThe policies like affirmative action because our country is so segregated that people don't have the opportunity to interact with each other and to break down those stereotypes and that is\nOne of the points of considering race in admissions process and to have a diverse student body at in colleges is though that these barriers can be broken down and what you heard\nFrom ... it was probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions with Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an apartheid system in our public\nSchools So Peter would let me turn back to you here because I just want to get down and I and we're going to I'm going to ask this question of Nicole as well but she's already spoken about how she believes diversity is is part of what's core to an essential\nBut if you were to have your druthers what would be the basis upon which colleges and universities in America admit students\nHe would have to admit students on the basis of proven ability aptitude determination self discipline the qualities that make for someone who can undertaker rigorous college curriculum and the full range of things that go on in college who lives in to the maximum\nAre aren't those ... ... ... to determine a determination et cetera aren't those various objectively measured though\nWell they can be objectively measured but they're certainly objective qualities involved in it as well students who do well in their academics through grade school and high school and who have\nTranscript showing the food's excelled in the courses that are available to them and have gone beyond those courses or showing the determination that does not just a matter of somebody subjective opinion about it but it's actually illustrated in their lives lived up to the point\nOkay because I keep going back to what Edward Blum the men who is really the force behind this case what he said in two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race in applications so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian plaintiffs now now Edward Blum has a long history of\nAgain bringing cases against affirmative action to the Supreme Court he also challenged the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder\nOr and and won that case if the Supreme Court or getting on the court to overturn a very key part of the voting rights act he's been focused on race a lot in America but but what I mean Harvard uses a athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why\nWhy should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with\nTheir merits there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against a students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean if you look there's a lot of other issues apart from race that a separate that the housing that has not have not in the way Harvard admit admit students\nWell Harvard may be making do hold decisions when it comes to the preferences who gives her legacies ... for uh people enough blood acts but those are decisions so the private university republic one for that matter are free to make\nSo why don't they make the decisions also then based on what they see as the mix of students that they need to ... to have a diverse campus\nBecause this country passed a law through Congress signed by president upheld by numerous Supreme courts which is the title six of the um\nAh Nineteen sixty four law and that just makes it plain that in this country discriminating on the basis of race is no go don't do it\nNow if Congress were to pass a law that says they're not into your preferences for athletes who would be strange law but no such law currently exists this is about Bain law\nI see okay so let's go to another call here Eli is calling from Steven city Virginia Eli you're on the air\nLike now I just wanted to call in because I think a lot of the narrative around this case and say that Asian Americans don't believe in affirmative action um a lot of people in the Asian community do believe in an effort that have action I'm Asian and all that\nAnd the majority of the plaintiffs any cases are Chinese American feeding 'em and I\nYou know they're not under represented in college football or the slightest affirmative action really helps black and brown fit into the market which is an American citizen sometimes I consider granting that I got married at ...\nYou know if this is going to give them a leg up we absolutely owe it to the students to do so and I think this is cases really hurting the overall Asian American community to benefit a few students\nWill Eli thank you so much for your call let's get a view from Samantha who's calling from La Crosse Wisconsin Samantha you're on the air\nHello and thank you for taking my call 'em up\nDoesn't involve Harvard but last year when my daughter was in Europe she applied to the John hopkins", "year":
