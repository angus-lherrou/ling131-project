Michigan get you're on the air\nThey grabbing the on back not thank you a panel or taking time to meet today and I I wanted to bring up some of the air quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what trap for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nYou know our neighbor one of the counties that Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to um\nOne thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be this consensus of white is Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously it was a heavy manufacturing state\nThe state that kind of gone through with a lot of the the deregulation\nDid either but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so a progressive guy who was in office there but I Want to ask you this question out in terms of you know what does\nPotentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a wave coming in a what the impact and what that leads on the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that was Dover\nAll there is a proposal ballot your that will potentially um you know change the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very\nPerplexing yea which you know not made the whole scheme you talk about when it comes to a battleground\nState Garrett actually thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there is one state of consequence that that seems poised to have a ... it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which were ... seems to have a pretty sizable\nUm substantial lead in the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is Marge and it was such a narrow margin ahead it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm\nUp against President Trump than twenty twenty\nYeah and then as Garrett was asking uh it seems a question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what we're going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy in the next two years and how that might that have an impact on a ... on on Michigan on on Michigan and Michigan workers\nWell it depends a lot on what happens with the terrorists that he proposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertain and he alternates between\nA talking about imposing more ... more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump and his policy that's safe to say it's a kind of don't know what's next\n... or or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think\nIf it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of there's some things are working you can just turn to do one eighty and or I were going to we're going to do something else and when it comes to Michigan or just the president to raise the twenty twenty race in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and one of the contrast\nBetween approaches and styles and ... and their view on the economy as well as how people feel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that far\nRight you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races are happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting at on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling show how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there is also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls\nNow and so really uh every vote counts and every person count and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election day okay\nSo this is then one of the reasons why\nI'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become a such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian ... is the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we're going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a refuting a Brian camps that statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rules\nThis is a man who had someone who arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot key raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of oppression feeds the narrative because that or suppression isn't only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidate secretary of state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from ... rooms extreme agenda that she has for\nGovernment takeover of healthcare wanting to give the scholarship to those that are here illegally in many many other radicalization\nThat's current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp Steven Fowler ... give us take a minute here to walk us through this controversy in Georgia what exactly has happened with voter rolls in Georgia and how important of an issue has become in the last week of uh of campaigning before the election\nWill so the two candidates we have here really are the diametrically opposed ends of voting rights and voting access\nSecretary of state camp has done a lot to clean up the role some people say purge the roles of removing people voting there is also a record number of Georgians registered as of yesterday it was six point nine million people\nAnd the early voting numbers are higher than they've ever been before the twenty fourteen midterms were at one point one million people that have cast a ballot early as opposed to about four hundred thousand and twenty fourteen\nBut on the other hand Stacey Abrams has dedicated a lot of her political career to getting more people to vote getting minorities to vote getting younger people to vote who haven't done and so the two have clashed over the years and it's complicated in this gubernatorial race and now there have been recent reports about a different numbers of people being\n[noise]

Nathan Gonzales he's editor and publisher of inside elections that provides nonpartisan campaign analysis Janet Hook is also with us She's national political reporter\nFor the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our color is it a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nMagna thanks for taking my call um we're healthcare voters and I'm among other big top big issues I'm\nLeading up to this election and it it's just so utterly ridiculous to hear these claims that is G O P uh lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions\nWhen their votes have said just the opposite and I know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election [noise]\nBut I mean you have you have to be off the grid to not know that these people are attacking people with preexisting conditions\nLeah thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what Leah said\nWell if a naked was right in talking about how central the issue health care issue is for the Democrats in if ever you wondered whether or not it was an important and winning issue there's nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue um\nIn past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there's one issue that has a really broad residence for people it's the protections for people with pre existing condition that pre pre existing conditions than Obamacare provided yeah so the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seem to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races up across the country let's go to Nevada here where\nAnd it's for Senate in Nevada uh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there\nAnd you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen a asking senator Heller to tell in a vat of family and their son whose name was dean why Heller quote broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nYou promise and even protect their health care and that way you would protect our protections for pre existing condition\nAnd then you went back to Washington\nAnd you for your promise to cave so\nI Want to tell you what can the camera\nThere watching tonight\nAnd what they want me to ask you assess as to send in the eyes\nReally tell them the truth\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against and Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions that debate\nYou can see that in turn different for you to under charge you consider themselves in terms of just not true I wrote I wrote the replacement bill for the Republican for exactly what you're not villages that bill includes pre existing\nConditions television of old he'll send in the eye and tell them the chance that it was on\nThe debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Meghan Mr Lee she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't point radio dot org Megan welcome to the program\nHi thanks for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race between senator Heller and representative Rosen\nWell as you just heard during that that clip it it's been a huge focal point of the race um you know like like you all were talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic a first term congresswoman has been really making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact that there was this sort of now in summit\nPress conference that happened last summer where\nDean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressed and if it can concerns about the\nFirst repeal repeal and replace proposal that Senate Republicans have brought forward but then he ended up actually voting in favor of of you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the\nThe repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she's run numerous ads against him accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act she had this sort of memorable ad\nAttacking holler as senator spineless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of sort of blowing in the wind when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act with it but it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the polls in this late stage telling you\nThat this race is still really close and you know if if you listen to folks talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into this\nCycle you know the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing reelection um you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the old on the most of them within the margin of error so you know everyone was expecting this to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wire so I think\nYou know the big question and and we're going to be seeing as how this message\nAnd are independent voters here um you know whether they do have a significant concerns about health care and and from what we've seen health care really as a top issue for voters here and the bad at all\nWell a nascent Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking somewhat vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nWell I think I'm One of the reasons why I think Republicans have a chance to gain seats who's I'm not convinced the Dean Heller joined delusion from look for much of a cycle that I really you know we had it as a toss we've I think we've and it's a toss up for the whole\nThe whole reason we're probably keep it there but in in the back of my my like you know I I think he's still going to I think it's going to lose and so that matters to mouth but if he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to Jeff which open seat in Arizona\nThen you know that increases their ability to actually gain seats but no matter has been interesting in a plug all plugged in Nevada independent from Megan in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone which which struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected\nYou just like well to Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two competitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending ... district\nAnd the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy to move and money and they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think were this was mid term Nevada enough presidential in mid term Nevada tends to be more Republican\nMaking what do you think about that\nI think that's that's exactly right and that's one of the interesting thing lately when sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen which we saw\nA complete Red Wings and Nevada and Republicans swept at you know control all of the state's constitutional officers of the legislature on the competitive how the I truly was you know a\nRed wave which which stands in stark contrast to what happens in twenty sixteen um but but that point I think back to write you know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well\nDuring the term elections on what's really going to come down to you know\nAll that effort they are putting in with their ground game to try and get folks to turn out with the help of the powerful coronary union here um which is part of what's known as the Reid machine has\nStarted by you know obviously former science are kind of leader Harry Reid um you know under his his tenure at the big question is Ken Ken Democrat you know make this look a little bit more like a presidential year as opposed to the ... midterm year in which they traditionally don't parents while\nSuch it's such an interesting thought that the midterm Nevada midterm any state might be different than president the then that stayed in a presidential year but one question for you\nMaking I mean here we are just a week to go before the midterms in a heard you say that you know I'm obviously there's a lot of question around whether what direction certain voters might go independent voters in Nevada et cetera but\nHow much uh it's the uncertainty right now is it is it that like are there are people still out there making up their minds based on certain issues or maybe last minute campaign stops or is it simply a get out the vote question now because I'm just like who out there still doesn't know how they're going to vote in Nevada\nUpdate coming out back then it's on point on the public radio it's ten o'clock\nMajor funding from point it's provided by

were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also join us anytime it on ... radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook at on point radio\nNow we will talk a lot about the Global Trends in democracy and they push back against democracy but first of all let's take stock of what happened in Brazil this weekend and joining me now from the capital Brasilia is recall it Brasilia ... bureau chief for Bloomberg News ray welcome to appoint\nBecker much right now so first of all described to us how significant is the fact that a ... one of the presidential election in Brazil it it does seem to be a profound\nFar a south America's largest democracy\nIt's a tectonic shift a frankly is the first time that are right wing government comes to power since uh Brazil returned to\nDemocracy in in Nineteen eighty five it's also the first time that the the left wing party the workers' party of of Lula last since two thousand and two\nUm so it is it's clearly a move 'em that takes Brazil or Latin America's largest nation and didn't entirely different direction what remains to be seen as to what extent um the rest of the country goes along are we also know that your boss and I had a very high\nRejection rate above forty percent\nI'm so he has come to power in part um because of this huge rejection with the traditional political class\nUm but at the same time not everybody is with him\nYeah tell us a little bit more about both know himself he's a former member of the Brazilian military member of the Brazilian Congress but until recently was dismissed as as unelectable because of a you know he's long history of of seeing that divisive things to say the least\nYes absolutely every race a slur as the uh some some despicable comments about about the women are things you don't necessarily want I don't want to repeat\nUm and and what what's particularly odd about him is that for twenty eight years nearly three decades he sat in Congress sort of a back bench or nobody\nHad heard of any haven't really done anything I'm a worth worth remembering and all of a sudden he manages to brand himself as an outsider or how do you have in Congress for almost three decades\nThey soon as the public radio\n[noise] support for on point comes from exact science is offering cola guard for average risk adults over fifty a noninvasive colon cancer screening tests\nThat can be used at home by prescription only information at color guard test dot com and carbon offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses including automatic back up\nFor servers in computers higher veil ability and disaster recovery solutions and automated data migration learn more and carbonate dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about the rise and the rise worldwide the authoritarian strongman the latest which happened this weekend in Brazil wears a year ... a right wing a Kennedy was elected handily as the new president of Brazil\nAnd we are joined today by Larry Diamond he's professor of sociology and political science at Stanford University\nSounding co editor of the journal of democracy and all throughout the spirit of democracy and Larry before we leave the question of Brazil a behind in in talking about the other nations actually want to get a call in here because we have a Brazilian voter Michael is calling from Boston, Massachusetts Michael you're on the air\nSea bridge a so Michael you there\nYes Hi go ahead\nYes I ah America\nI Lived here in the U.S forever I'm a U.S citizen voted for both of them out of this uh last Sunday along with a bunch of other presidents that some of them are illegal that suffer under quote unquote Trump's politics\nThe way we see both so NATO is not the way with the Trump or we see both for NATO as a a stamp against corruption the weight Brazil has been governed in the last\n... years um it's just it's just not sustainable the government machine there it is massive corruption goes beyond the higher echelons of government spread out throughout society\nAnd unfortunately uh there were only two candidates that made it to the run off so I had to pick between you know the worst or the the least worst right was the option for many centrists\nThat followed him as a um you know as a venue for or or you know as a vehicle for a to lead this nation\nIn Michael ... I just wanted to echo your point here is reading a you know for example I'm a quote in a in the Washington Post from a a sell polo dentist saying if there had been another decent Kennedy they wouldn't have voted for a ... knows a lot of garbage but quote he's the lesser of the evil thing exactly what you said there Michael\nBut I've got another comment here from a different listener Michael Gaskins says on Facebook to us why do people feel that they must give a green light to racism sexism homophobia and anti environmentalism in order to fight crime and corruption both ... brings all of the above to say nothing of his fondness for state sponsored murder\nWhat's your response to this other listener Michael\nCome from an African Brazilian descent so you know from black grandparents I have many gay friends that I voted for both of them out of\nThe the uh feminism a quote unquote argument against us without you know there are so many I was just so many things yeah it has set in the past\nFor example when you're you mentioned that lady that he talked about that particular that'd be it I Would argue I guess she was defending the gentler that'd be headed and rape\nSo he was he was he was so limited that a woman was not sending another fellow woman that was raped and be headed that level of conversation that he had to go against up yeah you're looking at people that go to jail they go to jail or things that will get capital punishment here and your wife\nThey'll go to jail they'll START I don't know three four years and then do leave right this or that young lady that killed their parents or she wasn't able to get out of jail for for a Mother's Day walk\nMichael thank you for your call your passion there and I want to hear Larry diamonds response to that uh Larry Diamond Michael very clearly saying that the problems in Brazil so overwhelming that\nBoth the more just to stay useful parts that he may not approve of in both narrow fall by the wayside\nWell I think it's great to Michael called them because we now have a direct expression\nOf the frustration and anger that produced the victory\nFor this extreme right and I'd say fairly exclusively authoritarian candidate and the problem is that when you as a voter a turn to or feel that you have little choice but to turn to such a blunt and Savage instrument\nAs someone who has been so explicitly authoritarian and has expressed over\nThe entire quarter century trajectory of his political career such frequent contempt for democracy you're putting the whole democratic system you know on the operating table\nAnd we need to keep something in mind magna uh when we look at what's going on in the world now but also\nThe history of democratic failure in the world frequently when you put in office they know failing or miss performing democratic system someone who has been\nAbundantly clear about his authoritarian intentions he acts on them and I'd say Brazilian democracy is a severe risk right now\nI'm I'm going to play a little tape that may or support exactly the point that you're saying uh Larry Diamond this takes us to the Philippines with President Rodrigo ... their um who was has been very outspoken about his crackdown on drugs and violence there\nOr to the point where you know he advocates extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and twenty sixteen\nHe actually compared himself favorably to Adolf Hitler saying that he would like to kill millions of drug dealers ... processor\nThree million you notice the meal\nThat are [noise]\nAnd these are just not in the Philippine president Rodrigo de ... saying Hitler massacred three million Jews now there is three million drug dealers I'd be happy to\nSlaughter them a butler Simon I said we've got some comments coming here from listeners um that wonder you know you said that democracy may be on the ... end up on the operating table\nIn these countries but Sean Megan says I think more than a little tongue in cheek he says I'm outraged that citizens of a foreign country can vote their free will and someone calling themselves ... says is it really a pushback\nOn democracy if the strong man in question if democratically elected in legitimate election what do you think but\nI'd say a few things I'm number one a detour to actually has presided over the extrajudicial killing of well over twelve thousand people on the streets of the Philippines so um\nSo we we have to take them seriously secondly although there is rising\nDespair and cynicism about democracy and Brazil\nThere is not a majority sentiment to end democracy in Brazil and that is certainly not what Brazilian voters want I don't think it is what our previous caller Michael wanted they just want decisive action\nTo reform and cleanse the system so you can say yes they voted for change they certainly did\nThey voted for what they perceived to be\nIn the runoff election the only option for real change that they are but that doesn't give both Sonora license to close down the Congress to closed on the Supreme Court as his son who is also a congressman suggested they might have to do or to violate civil liberties\nAnd lights and Brazilians now need to be very organized and very vigilant uh as we should be a from the international community and ensuring that both in our address is Brazil's problems in a way that don't violate the constitution and the rule of law\nYeah well Larry Diamond let me just bring in another voice into the conversation Laura king joins us today from Washington chief global affairs correspondent for the Los Angeles times lurking welcome to um point\nHigh maintenance it's great to have you ... let me just ask you I mean you you've heard Larry or talk about what he sees as some of the threats to do to democracy long term threat to democracy with the rise of these authoritarian leaders around the world\nUh I'm just wondering if you see any sort of or what are the unifying features that you see in what brought them to power I mean I ... the situation on the ground in each of these countries are slightly different but it seems to be that to me that one of the things that defines all of these leaders and I would include Donald Trump among them\nIs this cold is strong coal to an us versus them\nA political language that that is has resonated in each of these countries do you\n[noise]\nMm major money from the night and I like um I'm I'm\n...\nWhere you live for ABC News studio channels free right here in beautiful Providence election day exactly one week a way from tonight tonight we're helping you decide who to vote for in the race for mayor of Providence and thanks so much for joining us this evening for a debate I'm trying to look up\nWe do want to let you know we are streaming live on ABC six dot com Facebook Live as well as on the public's right do you want to begin with the introduction of our Kansas evening income in Providence mayor and democratic candidate for halo as an independent candidate die in the the women\nGet us thank you so much for joining us to see if I haven't made our panel we have ABC six news anchor Christina Myers\nPolitical reporter for the public radio in done is\nAn assistant professor of political science at Johnson and Wales Emily Lynch thank you all to our penalties for being here as well to hide\nWell here's how

thirty seconds to answer each question and then his or her opponent will have forty five seconds for ever bought all\nThe candidates can request than an extra forty five seconds of time for for the argument\nThat debate will last for an hour at the end of the hour each candidate will have two minutes to give a closing statement\nEarlier this evening we had a coin toss to determine who will get the first question\nMr ... one that toss will he will go first and miss witness one of the coin toss for closing arguments although she deferred and wanted to have closing arguments last alright that's out of the way let us begin first topic of the night will be addressing education Christina Mars your question from ...\nThank you John I Want to start off with the school bus driver strike and there are large I Want to ask you in two thousand Fifteen\nWhy did you agreed to a so called force and there's your and the contract with first it have cost the city is closed last company which ultimately led the company off the hook for getting kids to and from school when the bus drivers went on strike at the end of September\nWell that's not that's not actually accurate right so um when the bus drivers decided to strike goes actually no contract laughed at the previous contract had expired and it was uh the new contract with sitting in the city council so regardless of what was in the old contract there was no contract in effect\nAlthough we've been doing as we've been we've been investing in kids that that is our number one in our major priority when you look at the investments that we've made in case we had the first increased to school funding and seven years in the city of Providence now we've made the summertime and experience rich environment for all of our kids\nFrom summer camp to summer jobs to summer learning programs making sure that our kids are falling behind during the summer but instead have access to the tool so that they can actually get ahead during the summer and this November ...\nTo approve a one hundred and sixty million dollar investment to fix our schools and it would be a once in a generation once in a lifetime and I believe it to be the largest investment that we've been making of its kind here in the city of Providence and it's about putting our kids first and letting them know that\nWe're putting our money where I'm office we're investing in them and prioritizing so that every single one of them will be on track at least to reach middle class by middle age we're building an infrastructure support for all of our kids\nWhat would you could respond\nI absolutely would clearly it was in the contract the mayor sign the contract they bus drivers went on strike\nAnd the cause chaos in the city because kids to learn ten days of school and uh it was ridiculous that parents had to bring their kids to school Lewis work\nAnd had an insult to injury the new contract as we understand that includes the same language that would allow the kids excuse me it would allow the drivers to strike I think that the mayor should've had contingency plans the new the strike was going to happen weeks before\nAnd again that was an example of failed leadership\nMayor Louis or would you like to respond to that sure of course a what a what my opponent failed to to to to highlight once again as the fact that there was no contracted ... at the time that they decided to strive sort of dollars of what language was actually in the in the contract it wouldn't have mattered because there was actually no contract in effect\nWas that said I worked very hard throughout you know the two months before we found out that there was a potential for a strike\nAnd then those eleven days I was on the phone or meeting in person with a different parties\nEvery single day and we were able to resolve the strikes so that it was an eleven day strike and not an eleven weeks strike so we did what has to be done to make sure the kids get back to school at Safeway and as conveniently as possible for all of our parents this woman I Know you're itching to respond [laughter] they're forty five seconds\nThat let me say that if they if they had a teacher's had their contract I spoke with then they wouldn't easily have delayed school because of the land the opening and closing of schools and we could have barred buses from the other cities in the state of Rhode Island\n\nThey'll move along married when we have a very well no I mean I'll I'll respond to catch just absurd that's that's ridiculous you know if there was an easy solution to this then it would have been done you know these these are complicated issues\nAnd it you know my my opponent has been very good at criticizing but not very good at offering you know real concrete I'd genuine in on a solution and that's where we work on every single day\nAnd I've mentioned to all of the investments that we've been making an education\nFrom putting more resources into the schools to investing in social and ... and social and emotional learning supports\nTo investing in out of school time it's also investing in our school buildings now these are genuine solutions that's part of the the the strategic vision that we have for education in the city and you see the progress you see all of the kids participating and taking taking advantage of the programs that were offering\nWe want every one of our children to be on the path at least to middle class by middle aged and the investments that we've been making Evans putting our kids on that path\nThe swimming well there is a new contract with the same language that will allow them to strike again and I don't know how to set that some there could have worked collaboratively\nOr the other mayors and let the teacher you could have had contingents\nTo try to avoid problems and if you have problems you try to solve them uh like for the mayor just ingest that parents put their kids and then over and the left\nIs both a offensive and just plain and considerate and you can't even do it with a new or a less to have to be Eighteen or Bob so we have a new contract and the contract contains and saying language\nI Wonder if they're moving on it down to your question for ms Whitman\nMiss ... speaking of education just Seventeen percent of Providence School students ... state education standards for English language arts in twenty Seventeen the comparable figure for meeting math\nProficiency was fourteen percent if you were elected mirror what would you do differently to improve that new gr level of students' performance\nI Do believe again you have to bring your teachers and you have to settle a contract with your teachers they're equally as important to the school as your students are\nIt is absurd that they can be going close to two years without a contract it's not fair to anyone in the family\nI also have a plan where I'd like to start to reinvigorate neighborhood schools\nEvery study has shown that when kids go to a neighborhood school there's more buy in from the family more by in front of the kids and it creates community and that that is the situation than kids are eager to learn\nBut there's also a problem because the test scores have brought down by special needs children who after being in school for a um a month they have to go into the testing so that dilutes the tests somewhat\nMaryland or so you've talked about investment in education and how come there hasn't been more improvement and these poor test results in your time as mayor\nYou know ... there's no easy solution to education and anyone that suggests that there is is is it just that deluding themselves um and uh being misleading now there are five core um areas that are part of our approach to education\nThe first one is putting more resources into the school buildings where they belong giving more autonomy to the schools and investing in leadership so that you know a good leader can change the culture of a school building\nThe second is we believe in personalized learning\nThrough technology you can unlock the power where people can be challenged at whatever skill level there at wherever they are in the day in the year\nThe third is we believe in maximizing out of school learning time third is investing and social and emotional learning supports and fifth is making sure that our kids studying classrooms than its fire them to learn\nIt's the same with our finances the first thing that we did was to stop the bleeding that's why we've balanced every budget that I've passed\nPaid off the deficit\nBuilt up a rainy day fund and put our city and the sound financial position for the short term\nBut yet at every single turn I've um you know I've sounded the alarm by the fact that our unfunded pension liability if it's not addressed\nIt's going to continue to grow and squeeze out all of the investments we're making in other much needed areas what is it so we found it to address them now what is the status of beetle called grand bargain and so the big piece the heart of the grand bargain is finding a solution to the poaching challenged I propose\nMonetize in the water supply from a supply board up now you know what we need to recognize as we have to do something and second\nI put forward this plan ... they put forward the same plan we had a hundred and sixty page report put together by national exports they propose is is that is is this exact same plants\nAnd what I have told our our our residences and they'll keep an open mind I'll be making the case you don't have to agree with my proposal but if you disagree with the proposal you have to offer a viable genuine honest alternative because we have to do something\nMany folks have recommended you know perhaps saving thirty thousand dollars here perhaps a hundred thousand dollars there maybe even a million dollars there\nThat doesn't cut it the scale of the child because I Want to be mayor of that we need a big so this woman here forty five seconds I'm sure you want to respond\nYeah well again I'll say the surpluses are far we haven't even been guns to hear what it's going to cost us that the Justice Department came in and sued the city and the department of education we have no idea what those costs are going to be and\nI'm a\nAbsolutely am against talking about selling the water ... I'm sure that question's going to be asked directly\nIt is a fallacy you can't do it anyhow unions lettuce legislative approval\nIf you want to monetize the water I wouldn't work again with the legislature to see if we can charge or a wholesale prices if we can make a profit on that\nBut again this is not what a leader thinks about to sell your one asset and you just don't do that that will come back to bite you and I tell you something\nThe under that burden would fall on the set a sense\nThat was sort of along the professor Lynch and your question for mayor rewards are\nSo large that thing on the same topic here plan to lease the city's water does not have general assembly for so what is your alternative would you consider reducing payments to current retirees well\nWe're not to legally allowed to reduce the the payments that's part of the twenty twelve consent decree\nYou know we wouldn't be brought in in ... in contempt of court and so you know the the the talent shows that there is no ideal an easy solution\nYou know thirty Thirty years ago the city both gave away more than they could afford it and then refused to Fonda adequately funded the pension funds knowing that the bill would come do at some point in the future while the bill is coming due today and we have to do something about it\nWe've had experts look at this and we've had local community members look at it as we've had previous marriage look at this we are we're all converging on the same idea for reasons because there aren't that many options out there there was no ideal solution to this is only the best solution for\nThe given environment and what we have right now that's why I put forward and not the solution this illusion that yes it does require general assembly approval and it's important that you know we remember this is not a bailout for the city of Providence [noise] you know this is an asset that the city holes in the city owns that the city funded\nAnd that we've backstop all of the debt for so we take on all of the risk\nYet other communities they're able to charge a higher rate for it and all of that money goes into their system it's just not fair if anyone is going to benefit from the water is should the U.S because we take on all of the risk for it so again\nAnd they it's massively complicated it's very difficult to pull off\nBut we have to push forward on them you know I've made it a point to make sure that everyone as a matter of fingertip knowledge knows what the challenges so that we all agree that we have to do something to be aware of any solutions that found too easy for their found spoke English when there are no\nSir I Know you want to respond [noise]\nYes I Do want to respond again you cannot sell the water just not cannot salad or other cities that have sold their assets had had terrible problems with that uh again someone buys it not that they can\nThey their prices increased and well let's just say the quality doesn't go down I he talks about experts coming in\nAnd you can't you need a full appraisal of the water to lift the value is the marijuana in his down in six weeks and it costs a fortune to do it every appraiser and there are very few who can do water said it would take\nA minimum of six months to do a study even a cursory standing there\nTo Christina sure again my opponent is very good at you know pointing out problems but not very good at offering solutions so then what's the solution and I've heard the solution or a proposal base so let's create a hybrid four one K. O. four one K. system that might be a good idea but that offers the most minimal relief\nTo the one billion dollar unfunded pension liability so the question is still what are you going to do about it now you can't raise taxes enough to cover it you cannot for concessions enough to cover it it is a very challenging difficult solution\nIn fact you know her friend the person that she supported for mayor and still says did an excellent job while he was mayor ... is the person who got us into this mess\nWe can have the same kind of thinking this is about real and on a solution for very tricky\nAnd Jerome it's working forty five seconds yeah we'll we'll soon\nWe are working all with some bankers and we're working with some attorneys and we're working with some business people on a very doable idea that could possibly a address the pension problem in a very meaningful way\nI'm not at liberty to talk about it but I'm telling you\nDon't live it's not ... it's not logical maybe I have a better idea than who who's to know\nWhat I can tell you I'm bringing in people who know more than me about this and that's a lovely we will be able to get you the numbers but I'm going to ask that the mayor when we get those numbers ms ... I Hope both within the next two weeks and I ... I understand and if\nAnd if the mayor should win I'll give it to him because it's our city I care about the idea and I don't want to sell the water\nAnd I think we need to say this is the last time we're talking about buddy again the city is on the left because of the wonderful thing but he did much again he had his demons\nMove on to your question for ms Whitman\nA missile him and I wanted to ask about um potholes and construction and and other infrastructure issues like those\nWhen I put the questions out for ABC six viewers to write in what they were concerned about that was one of the number one things I heard back about was a construction projects seemingly taking too long streets that they felt they could no longer even drive down because of the issue of potholes\nHow would you make sure that enough\nOf the city budget is going towards construction and maintenance of the road for residents to not have to deal with these issues\nSo when I when the first thing I Would do\nTruly the first day is have an audit internal on it and then next turtle or this and see where every dime of our revenue goes what programs there are where we can spend money where we can't spend money I think we're going to have to in the next four years\nDo more with less so I think there's money to be found I think it is a disgrace the mayor has been in office for four years for nearly four years and the sidewalks are still\nIn Russia is deplorable conditions many of the sidewalks do not have cut us which are mandated by federal law\nAnd um you can't get a baby carriage she can't get a Walker and you can't get a wheelchair over these sidewalks even without the cutbacks there are so many sidewalk\nThan have the tree root problems there cracked it's again deplorable and we all know the roads are a disgrace I see them in all over town making quite patches to fill the potholes they're doing with just tar and\nThose will be washed out by Thanksgiving and that's not the way to do it again the mayor has for years\nTo take care of this and unfortunately it hasn't been done and I will war with all the stakeholders and community groups to reduce our blighted areas and to clean up this city and at least to empty the trash\nWe run out of time with this topic I Want to make sure you're done and says his question you and your question for mayor lord of misrule or so you say Richard gardeners forfeited his right to be a part of the Providence community if the mayor of Providence a former law school professor is saying that why should any other community in Rhode Island I have two or ... except a person like Richard gardener\nI think no community in Rhode Island would like to have a missed a gardener or living in their neighborhoods you know this man kidnapped children from their home\nNot sexually harassed a sexually assaulted them and raise them up I don't want that person living in my community and I don't think any single mayor on throughout the city wants them in their neighborhood\nShould we be put out on an iceberg somewhere I mean what do you do\nYou know it's not fair that it's the city of Providence that has to deal with and ask this question all of the time why such a heavy concentration\nOf a sex offenders living in our city and that bear in mind these aren't people that are from Providence now that are causing these ... these are folks from other cities this man this man in a committed most of these uh trust in Massachusetts why is he in our city\nYou know I ... I'm Sorry to say I'm a I don't want it to be our problem let folks in Massachusetts let some other community deal with it why the city of Providence every single time that's what I that's what I'm concerned about\nThis white men do you agree with your opponent that Richard gardener has forfeited his right to live in Providence\nOh his legally allowed to live anywhere he wants and that's again a the mayor came to that meeting and unfortunately he pander to the crowd with uh the twenty four hour coverage that is simply unsustainable were also the city will be sued by the ACLU\nRegarding this it if they win going to cost us more money you a leader again is the head of a problem a leader tries to solve a problem putting an easy fix which will cost a fortune\nJust to get headlines and to appease a hungry crowd is not the answer this to me is another sign a failed\nLeadership well I mean if I can ask woman ... sugar and then we'll move on to our next topic well then what is your solution solution that you've offered is walking up to his door knocking on it and I think the guy to please leave yes that call that naive I call it and I have once again ... what we're talking about are real solutions\nNot just a couple of weeks ago we had really anxious parents in that room genuinely concerned frightened about their child safety\nIt's important to make sure to reassure them that none of their children are going to be harmed and that's why we took the step that we took and you know what this is costing us in overtime or in detail this is all worth it if it's presented as a kid from suffering the same food\nPrices were going through a next topic are jumping into topic to talk to the pillows discretion what they were like ask her candidates are Christian or we've come back to your question for ms Whitman\nMiss what men with school shootings now being and unfortunate reality that our students have to deal with and um have expressed that they are fearful about every day when they go to school I'm calling for gun control laws leaving school to go to the state house\nWhat will you do to make sure that our kids feel safe when they go to school every day keeping in mind\nThat thirty seven million dollar budget deficits\nWell I Would like to get resource officers back in middle school and uh that's where kids are vulnerable Amir talks about middle class and middle age it's really middle school that a child's life\nMakes it the right turn or the wrong turn\nA you view again have to have your teachers with a contract at ... is the single most important uh entity and a child's life they need to feel warm safe and dry\nIn schools that needs to be warm safe and dry and your kids\nCan't come to school worrying at the end of the day when they go home will they be shot outside of school a gun safety has to be taught from the time child is in pre K.\nKindergarten you need to make those you need to teach in a way that children understand you resolve conflicts you don't shoot your way out of conflict\nIf your kids are in the gauge in a healthy vibrant educational environment they're not going to pick up a gun it just doesn't make sense they're not going to look for a fight\nIn a Mount Pleasant a couple of weeks ago there was a stabbing between two students this is not what we want our schools to represent\nWe won our students to be able to leave school safely and be able to take their place in the next phase\nOf their life ever lose a forty five surface that I Want to move on to him don't start\nThere there are two pieces to this the first one is you know God Forbid an active shooter stuffed into our schools on November search were asking all the voters to approve question for on the ballot to make a hundred and sixty million dollar investment in our school buildings and many of those investments will be made with an eye towards student and building safety\nThen there's also violence among kids and we have to reach kids early ...\nToo long that's why we've invested in social and emotional learning support inside of our schools\nThat's why we've invested in school culture coordinators in every single one of our middle schools and yes we do have a some challenges with violence inside of our school\nYou know we have school resource officers at that way that we deployed to our schools when needed but we also can't turn our schools into um a prison or and so we have to create that environment where kids feel safe with kids feel comfortable and we teach restored on their practices the\nAdonis your question now for mayor largely Mr Lewis I Know you'll tell us there's a lot of development taking place in Providence and that the forty six story proposed famed tower is not\nJust for the future of development in Providence but this proposals been playing out for a number of years now does that not send a negative development when it takes years to make a decision on this kind of big development proposal\nWhile I mean there are steps of the process and you know I think that the strongest message um two for economic development\nIs the cranes that you see in the sky and the workers that you see on the ground and then we have more development happening right now in Providence and we've had in a very very long time you know I I mean with developers all of the time and they pitched me on these projects\nWhat I've learned is that what they show you at first is very different from what ultimately gets built\nSo these projects change and they and they evolve\nNow they have to go through all of the steps in the process to make sure that the city and that the that the project conforms to our zoning ordinance to our historical um and so every piece of our our code\nUm but you know anyone who's anyone you come to Providence and you stayed over the past\nFour years no more development more economic activity more visitors to the city now we see property values increased these are all signs that people want to be
