old visualizing the route that he took to free so little climb seventies el ... and that's him going through a step by step all the moves he would make\nIn order to conquer the one of the world's most famous a rock climbing walls and he did it with no ropes that effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy Chin and Alex ...\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climbed do you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move 'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about what the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I moved my body\nBut then you know a firm I Know for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep us you know the rest of the pitch I could just count on myself to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole whole face so many times that I kind of just remembered most of it\nOr you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense of ... when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental arm or what is\nI actually um I actually don't call mental earners in the film a Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quoting something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut um but actually a big part of the process for me to be able to free solo cap was to sort of get past that I think if you like the idea of mental farmers to to sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like it's it's something it's too scary you sort of get psyched up and like shield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like I wasn't really a sustainable way to climb oh crap like it is just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that that at some point you know it's sort of\nCome to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to a point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable\nAnd I'm an I'm capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus in work that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film at two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to feel comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I've been dreaming about and thinking about it and climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I couldn't talk to you for the whole hour about the technical how preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ... but ...\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free so many of them have died and then that is shown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climber Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the death of the world's best free solar climbers I think\nEverybody who is made free cell I Am a big part of their life\nJohn back or with a pioneer with so called three solo climbing she found this past week at the age of fifty two\nWe're sorry to sort of on the death of us climate showing Larry\nShowing was killed in Utah was found a couple of days ago I was climbing a new some of the valley [noise] his body was found Saturday morning\nVersus climate as usual alone without roe\nMost people that are pushing the limits that they have this mentality of screw it whatever happens happens [noise]\nDown there from the documentary free so low I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing with no ropes that has really that really drew you in\nA yeah well yeah good good question\nUm I mean basically you know I mean so not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes ... scrambling a beautiful ridge and the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so there is definitely a place for for rope was climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an antisocial youngster so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the the feeling the freedom to speed the the fish and see I mean there's certain joy in bin climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it though to be clear free sewing stone a small fraction of of my normal climbing yeah you know I I I climb all styles you know all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various various types of climbing and then for selling has always sort of represented this\nThis extra little side\nBut you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean yeah\nThey don't uh yeah I'd actually understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of climate to me as well you know it's only a small part of what I Do okay you know it's always been sort of the most significant in a lot of ways\nTo talk to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads and I mean is it is it is zone that you just cannot enter or experiencing any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into that that feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling a flow whatever you want to call it but but um you know feeling like you're\nYeah um\nWell here here's why ask okay because I mean a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know I'm On in in some beautiful places in the western United States and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climb that I did that I got a little better and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my like ... climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering mind and body\nViewing of constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about ... you see you know for the bigger challenge is things that are slightly hurting them where you've done before it's would you feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit better what you do but of course\nWith re sowing though the costs of the mistake of absolute so you know you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but then another to blend\nWell I mean we ... the number one I mean we're all gonna die um I'm trying my best not to dark climbing are are very much want to move to old age and her family and all that but um no I mean I I I don't\nThink that if I just keep pushing middle for sure dark climate you know some time ago well\nLet me just reiterate nobody wants to [laughter] but um let me get some calls in here because we've got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex or we're speaking with Alex ... he is a professional rock climber a best known\nFor free sewing and in fact he did a free so low Yosemite is ... it's a three thousand foot wall in Yosemite one of the most famous rock climbing walls anywhere in the world did it without ropes and that story is captured in the documentary free so low which is directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy ... so\nLet's go to Kay who's calling from the new Ohio okay you're on the air\nYeah Hi mega ... and ... you did asked several of the questions I was gonna ask Alex about what drives him and that that that\nEdge of a risk and you know that\nThat drive to conquer but I go back and forth from Boulder, Colorado to Ohio and have so for the last forty five years so there's huge rock climbing community there and about four years ago go at the Boulder film festival they showed about four different documentaries\nOn climbing and so I was around that climbing community there and they did show on documentary on Yosemite and Alex it was so fascinating that\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from

chai far Sally and\nJimmy Chin I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor gain Joseph there who did that an MRI skin of your brain started talking about some of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis that I Am wondering now that you know that about\nUm you know the the shape in response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see a you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nNot particularly um ... I mean in general I I have a strong sense of I mean and I am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside\nI mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but um I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first at the scan yeah and um and they take away to me it was basically just that you know practice but that over time you can do some type of things and that's that's very much been my experience\nThat um that you can learn over time start you out it was next year from I heard that she was at one of the premieres for free so I Would have been good to see her grabbing ... out with her more actually but\nOkay well we can put we can definitely get you guys back in touch you know I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh and they just see it as like oh well your brain's effective so obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it\nOr I mean I've always heard it as as you know with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know it's I suppose it's a little bit open ended\nDo you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to uh called who wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to get his calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\nI ... I'm you know it's one thing to watch your preparing to go through in a regular on the wall where you are in their every move like but there's also the aspect of family and loved ones and I was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you prepare\nUm before going out of one of these big feet like al cap and do a photo of loved ones or anything like that ever come into your mind while you're in the midst of nervous multi thousand for this time\nYeah I mean that does and that's probably the biggest challenge and um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend a sunny and how we sort of navigate it that because in order words for selling is easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis or sort of argued that uh that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level or just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationship\nWell let me ask you was asking though in the middle of a big time I mean well let's talk about your el ... ascent yes either on August ... did you think of her or is what you bring that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the harder sections which represents maybe half the route um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing moves interest performing but then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners uh\nI mean I remember specifically on on a free souls or cap I spent you know maybe a five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey than than\nYou I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked out my my girlfriend uh [laughter] you know when I'm finished\nYeah well I mean ... as you write in a free so does the movie does explore um your relationship with sunny McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free solar climbing\nI Want and I'm like I Want to have my own listed compression you having I've already been guy like minds on you but we want to do over here and it's a pain when people die\nFeel like I Want in half way\nAnd when you sound like to take me into the equation [noise]\nAnd then Russia than going to be on with putting in Champaign can actually change anything would you actually make decisions differently\nIf I had some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan obviously I'd have to give up so on and on\nWays to me asking you do you see that as an obligation now\nOr not [noise]\nBut I appreciate your your concerns I have a you know I respect that but but I Know a few obligation now\nIs that true Alex you still not feel obligated to maximize your life span\nIt's kinda hard for me to listen to some of those there's no like oh I mean I have but that's struggled through the whole film there there's so many sections in our whole cringe that's that's pretty that's that was ... you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there is that you know whether I'm thinking about her or my family\nYou know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so\nYou know if I'm if I'm thinking about it there's not I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared but\nBut also I mean that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently have for maybe the seven proceeding years and so I felt like the ratio was was was different you know I mean now we've been in a great relationship for three years\nAnd I've you know finish this they climb and so you know moving forward and I'm sure the the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially ten you know so she went out or potentially\nA well I'm I'm sure it would be different and yeah I'm sure it would be different All right I don't know which way you know\nLet's go to another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nOh yeah I agree is or how you doing a ... all highly Alex you have the uh the mutant climber brain so congratulations a I'm a I'm a climber I've\nI did a various things from the early seventies and climbing my greatest accomplishment was a devil's tower in Wyoming\nUm which you know but the easiest thing on it is the hardest thing I can do [laughter] um so you know you you are a Superman and totally insane but when I was there a there was this this kid who is free sewing it\nAnd you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and and it's actually easier in a lot of ways because it's so much faster and and you don't have to stop and put it in protection which was really hard and really dangerous I really have been done too much leading and um\nYou know and I I was I was ... I you know the TV reporter I'd done documentaries and uh I really want to do documentary on this guy 'cause I sort of thought I was taught your ghost I just didn't think he'd be around and firefighters\nAnd but what he did was he actually held off the top of this thing and that's twelve hundred feet\nA vertical crystal on a vertical columns really really difficult thing in close to counter the third kind and repelled off the top like foot by foot and a quarter of a mile and clean the whole route with metal toothbrushes and broke off boulders\nYou know that were exploding like like ... you know blow\nOh and then and then it said that they said he then later free climbed yeah\nWondering if you ever done something that you know incredibly intensive and ah you know I Know you can't yeah of a it's a very smooth and closing the hundreds of thousands of people do that to me um\nYeah but no I I I very much went through that exact same process I mean are\nYou know the the film free so is is very much about the two years that I sent her telling the wall cleaning memorizing holds um you know\nI don't know if it's actually in the film but I definitely did spend some time removing some loose rocks from from one key section of a crack and um and then I can just throw 'em down and let them is because I was there too many people in the seventies which are already put them in a backpack and repelled back down at them\nUm but yeah definitely spent a lot of time you're physically preparing the ... because it just yeah I mean you have to there are scenes\n\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are SUVs and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance at ... dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven on him [noise]\nSome WVU I bought it in NPR I'd like to talk of already this is on point UN ambassador Nikki Haley will step down at the end of this year she leaves her two year tenure as one of the more\nAnd they have had one of the most challenging job in this administration representing America to the world at a time when nationalism\nNot multilateral ism drives the president's decision making Haley was a forceful advocate for the U.S withdrawal from the un human rights council and the Iran nuclear deal but unlike the president she also frequently called out Russia next on point Nikki Haley the U.S and the U.S [noise]\nMine from NPR News in Washington on corporate Coleman hurricane Michael is a little more than fifty miles off the Florida Panhandle with top sustained winds of one hundred forty five miles per hour it's a category ... storm very close to a category five\nSome parts of the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region could see storm surge between nine and fourteen feet enough to swallow some homes\nFlorida governor Rick Scott is urging people who've been told to evacuate to leave now\nListen to local officials you do not want to be the person who survived the storm just to put your life or your family's life at risk after passes because you didn't listen to local officials\nDuring a storm first responders cannot come out and said you it's too dangerous now is it time to prioritize to keep your family's faith do not take chances\nThe storm is expected to crash into Florida in a few hours then rocket north through Georgia and the Carolinas the Fort ... into the Atlantic ocean\nMeanwhile Georgia's governor has issued an emergency declaration for hurricane Michael from member station W.

her time at the un is one of the few women in President Trump's cabinet and one of the few if any gender who's come through both unscathed and even more popular than when she when she went in quite a feat for the former South Carolina Governor who was once a leading never Trump voice\nSo how did she balance being America's chief global ambassador while serving in administration that ... global alliances this hour on point assessing Nikki Haley's time at the un\nAnd what's next for American foreign policy and you can join us\nHow do you think ambassador Haley represented the U.S\nAt the un on the Iran deal on North Korea what about the U.S withdrawal from the human rights council or criticism of Russia\nDo you think as Haley says that the world respects the U.S more now or less where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk you can also join us anytime it on point radio dot org or Twitter and Facebook and on point radio\nAnd we're going to start today from Washington with Eli on a Johnson she's White House reporter for Politico and we've got a link to her latest story which is titled Nikki Haley flips the script on Trump that

story is Nikki Haley stuns Washington by announcing resignation from un posts and if that is at all put radio dot org that link column welcome back to you as well\n... thanks for having me back though okay so let me just start with you I'm I'm actually going to play a little bit of tape here from what the president said uh at the press conference when Nikki Haley made her resignation public\nAnd he was extraordinary laughter tore she said he said at the very very least she has improved the position of UN ambassador she's\nHelped make it a much better position if you want to become\nMaybe more glamorous physician that it was two years ago maybe I Wonder why but it is and she's made it a very glamorous position she's ready to a more important for board way more important so we have a I can almost say many people don't want to do it at a very good people\n[noise] so we ought to help us read this I mean the the president's reaction to this resignation is quite different than the virtually all the other members of his cabinet who've left in the past couple of years uh how do we read of the presidents we'd right now [noise] [noise]\nWell the president's reaction was so interesting because he's let previous cabinet secretaries dangle by a threat and and speculation that swirled about when he would fire them that happened with Rex Tillerson and happened with a national security adviser H R McMaster\nHappening with his Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin and it's happening with John Kelly who was his chief of staff right now all this speculation about when they'll even Nikki Haley\nAnd in the headline in my piece was she flipped the script on him by a colluding with him a about ... allowing him to control the news cycle surprising everybody about her resignation Trump knew about it he said uh as far as six months ago but he kept a secret\nBecoming part at least\n[noise] support for on point comes from college fine where consultants work with high school

visor dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about UN ambassador Nikki Haley and about her decision to step down at the end of this year we're assessing her time\nAt the un and we're going to talk about very specific issues that she let on and spoke out on here in just a minute but I'm joined today by Eliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico and by Colum Lynch un based to cure a senior diplomatic reporter\nAt foreign policy and I just want to play a little bit of sound here of the to get a sense about what Nikki Haley feels or her success at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump the U.S engages in multilateral ism\nOnly on us terms\nSince the secretary general meeting last year we have found out of the Paris accord we've pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that is to say that the United states is determined to obviously be involved in multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in a way that they are mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements the United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokesperson delivering this message\nAbout ambassador Haley's work at the un on ... behalf uh this is in response to her decision to step down\nThey had a very productive and strong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey worked hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states showing the value of the United nations secretary general looks forward to continuing to work with invested really until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James to read us he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive now the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf seems to read as well come back to them point\nGreat to be back with you Mary and how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success was at the un in part by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreements but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying but there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI I find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said she maintained her independence she struck out\nOn a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable are investor for the United states however um I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated\nA I don't think contempt is too strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surrounded and the international constellation so she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's uh\nDrawing from treaties denigrating international organizations\nOkay well so tell me more about that I mean if you will have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of amplifying the language of the Trump Administration after you and what are some of those moments that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to\n'em I start with the uh on the negative side the withdrawal from the climate agreement I think that will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration\nKind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her particular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on a Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons on calling out Russia it's\nA fascination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done absolutely and I think that in every sense her departure a is\nA win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and vitamin ... in particular\nSo Colum Lynch respond to that I mean this is one question that I've had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration one of the most challenging jobs there is an administration because of exactly what\nI Am most readers has said there that are you working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in ... at some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI [noise] I think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that Haley did a very good job of trying to sort of um\nYou know tamped down his most sort of anti you and you know destructive kind of tendencies and was able to kind of bring him along explained to him what the un un was doing trying to bring Jared and evolve come on board to sort of recognize the benefits of working\nUm you know through the multilateral system but you know she is very much in her remarks that you just played a very much embracing the White House America First I'm sort of doctrine she has\nBeen you know ... and she has been a kind of lead agent and the administration to push for a and then to foreign aid for countries that are not you know close friends of the United states I'm\nAnd she has been you know very very tough on a number of other issues I mean I think at the un she does have a lot of um achievements that she can point to um she didn't able job and\nLeading the negotiations on I'm sort of a extending sanctions against North Korea uh she's been quite active on some African issues that to others and the administration of shown very little interest in Central African republic the\nUm South Sudan um other sort of humanitarian issues but it's been sort of it's sometimes hard to see you know and in one sense she has sort of um embrace this kind of brand of being kind of a\nA humanitarian actor and I had a promoter of human rights within the administration but then that sort of conflicts with her positions on um you know dealing for instance with the Palestinians where she's been quite um quite harsh and and the way that she's dealt with that issue\nElliana Johnson the new uh we've got to let you go here in a minute but I just wanted to get your take on something that seems to read it said that um\nThat there are some things that Nikki Haley the bathroom Hayley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to ... you know in her future political career because she was a line so closely with the president you know whether that's two years or four years\nBut but that's a reality to this that she's gonna she's going to be wondering about\nListening both to add ... talk and to ah to call him taught\nI I think Nikki Haley I did this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be touting her accomplishments and everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as a moving the U.S Capitol championing and move of of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem things that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those are things she can run on in a Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to defend in a general election and absolutely\nWell Elliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much you know it's great to have you thank you All right let's get some calls in here let's go to Frida who's calling from Tucson, Arizona feeder you're on the air Hi thank you\nSo I'm an independent voter have them for decades eminent ejected as I Do go vote in both parties and I don't think that Nikki Haley came out of this on the case I think her positions on Paris\nA Jerusalem and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal are all major uh\nFumbled on her part I realized that those were positions of the president Xi is representing but those are not successes and I definitely see us as a country has fallen greatly down on the scale of respect around the world\nI think supporting and apartheid stayed in Israel is going to be go down in history as a major the major flaw to what she thinks are her successes I Would love to have seen her\nReally stand up to the president but I don't think she would have maintained her position I Do think she just pandering to whatever her next political goal is\nFreedom thank you so much for your call a James to just let me turn back to you here because you're free to their especially talking about a Nikki Haley's very

chocolate party we're talking about UN ambassador Nikki Haley's decision to step down from that post at the end of the year what her legacy and her track record is at the her two years representing the United states in the UN and what could be next\nFor the next UN ambassador and for American foreign policy as a whole and we're joined today by Admiral James Stavridis he is a former Supreme allied commander at NATO and he's now an operating executive at the Carlyle group and author of the leaders bookshelf\nColum Lynch is also with us he's un based senior diplomatic reporter at foreign policy magazine and gentle moved a lot of callers who want to join us so let me just get some of them in here where at one eight hundred and four to three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk who's go to Vivian who's calling from east vessel borough main you're on the air Vivian\nOkay thank you for taking my call I I Am an independent voter and I don't want to either party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised by Nikki Haley's\nAttitudes that she took as as a representative to the un she stood up to a lot of the hypocrisy that was shown by the human rights organizations\nAnd she stood up to a lot of them are we see\nThat characterize Israel as of right wing country and ah and you know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the Palestinian camp she went she went to visit the Palestinian areas\nAnd maybe what happened was\nThat she said that they really weren't so bad luck and that\nMay be why she decided to support Israel and moved on\nWell Vivian Vivian let me go let column respond to you to your uh your questionnaire and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nI'm I think the I think that the characters isn't true because I mean she went to the to this you know refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nAnd came to testify before Congress and made and and passionate personal sort of appeal for them that this these programs really did make life better for them that\nThe alternative was not necessarily be good for U.S interests that you would might the withdrawal of aid might sort of contribute to a promoting the most of the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much um\nMoved by that by that visit 'em what really I think change your view on this was really um the the dispute over the U.S moving um the um\nCouncil vote in which um she was a she was you know cast a veto against fourteen other ... members she was totally isolated\nUm the u._s. was isolated and the U.N General assembly afterwards and I think it was after that this sort of notion that the Palestinians were defying the United states that they were rallying international opinion against the United states had really kind of um\nShifted her kind of orientation actually became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience well\nI'm gyms to ... to someone to come to you and your thoughts about this but just let me I Want to play a little bit of tape here to offer some contacts uh this first because I ... the the ambassador Haley has spoken very forcefully about\nUs support in the Trump administration's support for Israel so first of all this is from march two thousand Eighteen so just a little earlier this year and a basket of Haley was speaking at the annual American Israel public affairs committee conference in Washington\nReceived a multiple standing ovations throughout the evening and here's one such moment\nHave sent in an organization with a hundred and Ninety three country the United nations spin on attacking only one country we will not anyhow [noise]\nThat was in March of this year and then to Colum Lynch is point about the UN's response to the United states deciding to move\nA it's a it's it it it's a embassy to Jerusalem last December the un scheduled a vote on a resolution denouncing that move an investor Haley at that time tweeted quote that the U.S will be taking names of those who vote against the United states\nThat got some pretty extreme reaction here's former U.S ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns on CNN really criticizing Haley for that\nThis was extremely ill advised by the Trump Administration by the president in ... I'm kind of surprised that in ... during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective\nYou know our our ... were a great country where the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective presidents\nThey lead with self confidence and they lead was supporting our allies there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council you win some you lose you can't you can't vote your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us some former U.S ambassador to NATO last December James to read is how do you respond to that\nI agree with Nick burns and I've worked with Nick on multiple occasions including a during the NATO years he's got a a a ... view of all this now having said that\nI think that um the youth and has over the years are gone way over the top in beating up on Israel and Israel is our strongest ally partner and friend in the middle east but um friends neat to occasionally\nSpeak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked or Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can help close that gap between Israel in the United nations is frankly not in U.S interests to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to be thinking about is how do we close that gap\nTactically saying things like we're going to take names uh is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nI bake a U.S up on a on a on a half a song and maturation his cabinet\nHis comments on our streets update as she yeah she said her a\nCall and I'm gonna have to jump in on you because your cell phone is a it's breaking up on us it's it's a bit challenging to understand but but James to read it I Know we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling was getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making a more challenging for members of the cabinet to do their job because of the president's position and language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that uh the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit a would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more in my two years in any American administration in history and his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go forth and that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that\nOur allies partners and friends are concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy and a a good example would be NATO during the campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it\nUh then he went over and it was a series of conversations that we're not a particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I\nSupport article five the an attack on one is an attack on all uh but then subsequently he went back to really excoriated the allies for for spending and we ought to put pressure on them they ought to increase their defense spending\nBut I'm at the same time he he praises people like Vladimir ... and that is confusing and erratic um when coupled with bombastic statements like he deployed in front of the general assembly that\nDoes not do us well in our position in the\nWorld and that he's going to name the next UN ambassador so I just wonder I mean the last question to you James to read his ... you know has Nikki Haley actually sort of provided a model of we were talking about this earlier in the show\nHow to both serve the president a and this particular administration but but operate in the un in a way that doesn't let 'em you know him or herself be defined by it by the president\nAbsolutely correct and uh the problem is going to be that there will be countervailing forces who will\nTake a look at Nikki Haley's performance and say uh you know that's really not what we want we want someone who's more under control who reads the talking points from the White House more closely or is constantly in lock step and that will be the tension or you know in fantasy land magna\nZoo dot org\nMajor funding for on green is provided by Geico

transracial adoption uh and and her search for her identity and what difference it made her\nWhen she actually sought out the truth of the story of her biological family were one eight hundred forty three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk uh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in\nYour life um but but there's just not the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nI Want to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt a lot okay hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think part of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not of ... of adopted children mind you but\nAnd I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that that your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race I mean thinking about this\nFrom their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is um I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just\nThings I Wish I had in my cat but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed this to me that they wish they had then offered more and\nThey would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them um and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with him about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family\nUm that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know I'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we'd gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you know they ask many questions just nobody really was telling them because there's some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how you answer this question or\nYou know talk to your child about racism you know nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to to to have those conversations I think\nOkay now so I can hear it and fully understand how the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about uh was was something difficult enough to handle 'em or know know what to do with how to come through that but in addition to that\n... was there was a longing\nThat you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of was there a longing we're empty nesters something that you felt that needed to be filled because of you know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're combustion as you saw with your parents\nYeah I think it was it wasn't so much an empty nester and I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did kingly feel once I was old enough to notice and once I was old enough to have that pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly\nI'm In a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only like ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable um\nI don't know the closest I can come as like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships and great relationships and I love my family in an all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up it was a a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family there was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this is guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true\nThat that might not be and can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what mattered finally\nDecided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in the book my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I hadn't become a parent but other times I'm convinced that I Would rather than flee search no matter what you know it's not something I have a firm answer to I've certainly been curious I wondered\nUm I had gotten a little bit of information um that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names no addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve um but it was really my pregnancy that that was it\nMy first prenatal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birth\n'em and why I was born so prematurely ah because I was I was born about ten weeks early and I don't know I had no answer that it was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and child birth it just\nI don't know something about my ... my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family but I was really scared and also\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think\nEvery parent go through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and they can only those questions really become far more acute when there's so many on answered a issues in in the the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers who want to join us and uh and I just want to get at least a couple of them here\nTo be able to share their stories but can you hang on for a second willy willy welcome some more callers him have certainly let's go to Jim who's calling from El ... Pennsylvania Jim you're on the air\nGet fellow I thanks for taking my call um I just have a story of my ah I'm white I'm my first wife and I we adopted two children of color um one when he was six weeks old\nAnd the other or when he was two years old um and there was a year a difference between them so um my my story starts when they're like a four years old and three years old [noise] and um they're all grown up now other twenty and Twenty one\nBut a a one day we're walking through the uh Walmart parking lot and just me and them and I've got one by chance and a kind of out of nowhere the younger one jak he says\nNo I'm Sorry I'm a little nervous I'm On the radio that's all right on our one Isaac ... about forty years old he says he says that he says why are you white and were black\nAnd you know write them it's like oh goodness I didn't think I'd have to have this conversation in a Walmart parking\nLot you know mhm\nI'm so I'm ... I don't well\nHe started oh isn't it I go to answer him and my younger son jak who is lighter skin um he stops he stopped right away three years old he stops he rips his hand out of my hand and he says\nI'm not black on white huh and so now I turn to him because oh my goodness I I hadn't thought about how they view themselves you know yeah and you uh you know the younger one she was a a a mixture of a you know African American and Hispanic\nAnd he was just lighter skin and an Isaac was African American in a Caucasian and was a little bit darker skin right and now I Am now you don't now my focus shifts and I'm like well and before I get the answer might be older son looks across me to his brother and says\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and constant contact with hundreds of customize ... emailed template for small businesses to reach\nCustomers where they are every day there inbox learn more in constant contact dot com and college fine we're consulting work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more\nAt college fine dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate party we're speaking with Nicole ... her new memoir is all you can never know what's her story of her transracial adoption and joining us as well as Joyce McGuire pave oh she is the founder of the center for family connections and nonprofit that serves children and blended families\nFor more than Thirty years a now Nicole just I Wonder if you could just\nBriefly tell us what happened when you finally we're reconnected with your with your biological family because I imagined that growing up there's a there's a very understandable tendency to idealize the people that you don't know it was at that up but that I deal wasn't wasn't fully realized\nI mean it's dangerous ideal I think people you've never met her um you know a lot of ways and it really was sort of a confirmation of that story I'd gotten as a child that much deeper and richer and more complicated um and it was interesting you know I\nI hadn't thought enough honestly about my birth parents perspective and what it must have been like like what factors could have led to the adoption that was something I guess I wondered about in a way as a kid but I it didn't have them maybe emotional maturity\nIt might have gone through I was not expecting um to find you know a story that had so much like trauma really um and lost that had nothing to do with my adoption you know things that were just difficult that they were dealing with um that you know ... might have been factors in the adoption certainly but weren't like directly caused by it for example\nUm so when I first reached out to them and I did Sylvia a confidential intermediary a under Washington state law\nAt the time I was placed in at the time I searched had to go through a third party so that person forwarded a letter from me and before we could exchange any identifying information like things like last names and addresses and really specifics about our lives you know we had to get various forms completed and it had to be by mutual consent\nUm so that also made the process take a little bit longer\nUm but I reached out through the intermediary um and my birth parents at the time I found them had been divorced for many years so I wrote to them separately\nAnd I'm so there's like two different or unions really with two different branches of the family instead of the one and like lively I had always pictured like talking with and meeting them or reconnecting with them at least like together\nSo that was I was interested I was my first sort of surprise um and what I found initially or was that they had never told my sisters my biological sisters I have a half sister and a full sister and uh they were living at home at the time I was placed and they'd never been told about the adoption they'd been holding died at birth\nAnd All right when I wrote to my birth parents um you know do too I think the language barrier or just some difficulty translating the letter um that was sort of how my sister's got involved and how they found out\nAnd it was definitely a shot for them you know as as little as I knew they knew even less than I did and uh so it was really it was like a ... it was a whole family is sort of reconnection about as I mentioned segment that into like different different branch um that was it was unexpected [laughter]\nWell I mean so Joyce adoptions are so complicated right because you're dealing with the lives of the the lives of so many\nPeople at ... at the ... the most vulnerable point probably in their lives so we've been hearing Nicole say that that her biological parents hadn't even told their other children I mean how how do you would\n... I don't know how long is that unusual no really\nIsn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment\nBirth parents get the least and they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there are so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every stories that case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's the whole family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of her sisters did you know ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is did that process than help\nUh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family\nTo to to go to I think the primary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched were just simply kind of gaps and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or other other factors I certainly cared about\n'em I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is\nOne of the reason they searched but I think it was really from my sister is especially my full sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information um you know she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always feel I I I wasn't really part of this family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please thought a medical history and\nIf I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that so but Cindy Cindy with this with her family family the only ones who got and I think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers\nAnd that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps in knowledge [laughter] well this is obviously an issue that has had an impact\nOn many people's lives 'cause we've got a stack of callers and I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call\nUm I was raised in the south or in the sixties or seventies adopted Fifteen Years ago a beautiful young man from a lot of law and my question is is I don't have any experience how do I prepared on my son for a living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experienced racism\nJohn yeah I had lived in upper middle class load from when the military where there's very little racism than you know I'm just not face those yeah how do I prepare my son to go out in the world you know every dark he's you know going to face referring I don't know what to tell a\nJewish do you have an answer for John well I you know they're at the huge question but one of the answers is to make sure you surround yourself with people of color or especially you know if he's African American um you know I make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for on models for him\nAnd that you look for help for you ah you know the best people to help you to understand how to deal with racism or people who have experienced it\nAnd so it and it's also good for him to see you claiming these people who are like him and not just him yeah

years ago and I feel really grateful that we had the agency we did I had I had no knowledge of how to do this when I when we started\nBut one of the requirements of her agency was that we attend numerous workshops throughout the process and a few of them involved adult adoptees who\nUm [noise] um where people of color adopted by white parents who shared their stories which in many cases were not so good mhm\nAnd made clear to us how important it was for one thing I'm not you know to the extent we could don't live in segregation\nOur kids were grow up I'm In a more multi racial a

talking about UN ambassador Nikki Haley and about her decision to step down at the end of this year we're assessing her time\nAt the un and we're going to talk about very specific issues that she let on and spoke out on here in just a minute but I'm joined today by Eliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico and by Colum Lynch un base to cure a senior diplomatic reporter\nAt foreign policy and I just want to play a little bit of sound here of ... to get a sense about what Nikki Haley feels or her success at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump the U.S engages in multi laterally them only on us term\nSince the secretary general's meeting last year we have pulled out of the Paris accord we've pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that is to say that in the United states is determined to obviously be involved in multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in a way that they're mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American sheep\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements the United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokesperson delivered this message\nAbout ambassador Haley's work at the un on ... behalf uh this is in response to her decision to step down\nHad a very productive and strong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\n... the United states showing the value of the United nations secretary general's forward to continuing to work with invested or Haley until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James Stavridis he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive now the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf teams to read is welcome back to them point\nGreat to be back with your ... how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success is at the un\nIn part by a expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreements but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying but there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI I find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said\nShe maintained her independence she struck out a on a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable or in vast her for the United states however um I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated\nA I don't think contempt is too strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surrounded and the international constellation\nSo she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that we're very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties and denigrating international organizations\nOkay well so tell me more about that I mean if you have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of amplifying the language of the Trump Administration at the un what are some of those moments that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to\n'em I start with the uh on the negative side go withdraw from the climate agreement I think that will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration\nKind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her particular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on a Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons on calling out Russia on its\nAssassination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done\nAbsolutely and I think that in every sense her departure a is a win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and vitamin ... and in particular\nSo Colum Lynch respond to that I mean this is one question that I've had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration one of the most challenging jobs are there is an administration because of exactly what\nI Am most readers has said there that are you working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in ... at some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that Haley did a very good job of trying to sort of um\nYou know tamped down his most sort of anti un destructive kind of tendencies and was able to kind of bring him along explained to him what the un un was doing trying to bring Jared and evolve come on board to sort of recognized the benefits of working\nUm you know through the multilateral system but\nRemarks that you just played a very much and bracing the White House America First I'm sort of doctrine she has\nBeen you know ... and she has been a kind of lead agent and the administration to push for a and then to foreign aid for countries that are not you know close friends of the United states I'm\nAnd she has been you know very very tough on a number of other issues I mean I think at the un she does have a lot of um achievements that she can point to um she did in the ... job and\nLeading the negotiations on I'm sort of expanding sanctions against North Korea [noise] uh she's been quite active when some African issues that to others and the administration of shown very little interest in Central African republic ...\nUm South Sudan um other sort of humanitarian issues but it's been sort of it's sometimes hard to see you know and in one sense she has sort of um embrace this kind of brand of being kind of a\nA humanitarian actor and in that have sort of promoter of human rights within the administration but then that sort of conflicts with her kind of positions on um you know dealing for instance with the Palestinians where she's been quite um quite harsh and in the way the shoes do without issue\nYeah Eliana joins in a new uh we've got to let you go here in a minute but I just wanted to get your take on something that seems to read it said that\nUm that there are some things that Nikki Haley the bathrooms Hayley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to haunt or if you know in her future political career because she was a line so closely with the president\nYou know whether that's two years or four years from now I Know that's forever in American politics but but that's a reality to this that she's got a she's going to be wondering about\nListening both to add ... ... talk and to a column taught\nI I think Nikki Haley I did this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be touting her accomplishments and at everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as a moving the U.S Capitol championing the move of of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem things that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those are things she can run on in a Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to defend in a general election and absolutely\nWell early on a Johnson White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much and I was great to have you thank you All right let's get some calls in here let's go to Frida who's calling from Tucson, Arizona Frida you're on the air\nHi thank you [noise] so I'm an independent voter have them for decades eminent jak than I Do go vote in both parties and I don't think that Nikki Haley came out of this unscathed I think's her position on Paris\nA Jerusalem and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal are all major uh\nFunnels on her part I realized that those were positions or the president Xi is representing but those are not successes I definitely see us as the country have fallen greatly down on the scale of respect around the world\nI think supporting and apartheid stayed in Israel is going to be go down in history as a major ah\nAs a major flaw what she thinks are her successes I Would love to have seen her\nReally stand up to the president but I don't think she would have maintained your position I Do think she just pandering to whatever her next political goal is\nFreedom thank you so much for your

I'm kinda surprised that investment hairless during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective you know our our ... were a great country where the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective president\nAnd they lead was supporting our allies there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council you win some you lose some you can't you can't vote your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us some former U.S ambassador to NATO last December James to read us\nHow do you respond to that I agree with Nick burns um and I've worked with neck or on multiple occasions including er during the NATO years he's got a a a pretty ... view of all this now having said that\nI think that um the youth and has over the years uh gone way over the top in beating up on Israel I'm In Israel is our strongest ally partnering friend in the middle east but um friends neat to occasionally\nSpeak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked or Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can help close that gap between Israel and the United nations is frankly not in U.S interests are to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to be thinking about is how do we close that gap\nTactically saying things like we're going to take names uh is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nHigh as well make a U.S up on a\nOn a on a half a song on ... on his cabinet ha ha ha ha ha ha ... you have comments on our safety update as or post yeah uh she said her a\nCall and I'm going to have to jump in on you because your cell phone is a it's breaking up on us it's it's a bit challenging to understand but but James did we decide now we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling was getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making it more challenging for members of the cabinet to do their job because of the president's position and language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that to the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit a would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more in my two years in any American administration in history and his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go forth and that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that\nOur allies partners and friends are concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy and a ... a good example would be NATO during the campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it\nUh then he went over and I was in a series of conversations that we're not\nA particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I support article five the an attack on one is an attack on all uh but then subsequently he went back to really excoriated the allies for for spending and we ought to put pressure on them they ought to increase their defense spending\nBut I'm at the same time he he praises people like Vladimir food and that is confusing and erratic um when coupled with bombastic statements like he deployed in front of the general assembly that does not do a swell in our position in the world\nAnd that he's going to name the next UN ambassador so I just wonder I mean the last question to you James to read his ... you know has Nikki Haley actually sort of provided a model or we were talking about this earlier in the show\nPretty do administration but but operate in the un in a way that doesn't let 'em you know him or herself be defined by it in my mind the president\nAbsolutely correct and uh the problem is going to be that there will be countervailing forces who will\nBecause look at Nikki Haley's performance and say I'm you know that's really not what we want we want someone who's more under control who reads the talking points from the White House work closely a is constantly in lockstep and that'll be the tensions are you know in fantasy land magna", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "10"}
