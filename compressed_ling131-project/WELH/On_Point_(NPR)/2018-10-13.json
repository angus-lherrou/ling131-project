{"month": "10", "state": "RI", "station": "WELH", "content": "Radio dot org [noise]\nLast week an independent candidate for governor in Rhode Island was charged with possessing forty pounds of marijuana\nThis week another independent candidate for governor said that back in the Nineteen seventies he academic accidentally struck a youthful Nicholas Matty yellow wall breaking up a group of rowdy young boys bad halo of courses now the speaker of the house at the in Rhode Island\nIt's no wonder that ... that political reporters like myself have a say in Rhode Island politics is the gift that keeps on giving [noise]\nBut it's not all laughing matter rode on continues to face serious challenges as we count down the weeks until the November ... election will talk about those issues during the public's voice twenty eight team a foreign being recorded before a live audience at the beautiful Providence ethane am\nOur topics include the hottest political races fall out from a fallout from Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination fight and rising activism by women in politics on political reporter Ian Donna's and I'll be moderating the discussion and I'd like to introduce our distinguished panel immediately\nIt's my right is Leanne Senate ... she was elected National Committee woman for the road on Republican Party in twenty fourteen she has a very uh officially Rhode Island job as the controller for a whole wholesale seafood company next ... is Kevin Lawson noisy\nHe was hired as executive director of the road on Democratic Party in twenty Seventeen\nHe previously worked as director of purchasing for the city of Providence\nAnd next to Kevin is Valerie address a professor at ... of political communication at wrote on college and someone who keeps a very keen on on Rhode Island's political seem\nSo let's start with the race for governor of the November ... election is less than four weeks away\nDemocratic incumbent and Gina Raimondo says she wants to build on her efforts and her closest rival Republican challenger Allan Fung says her efforts are not good enough and that he's a better choice for governor\nLet's start with ... Senate ... what is at stake in this election what difference will it make if it comes down to Gina Raimondo and Alan ... and voters choosing between one or other of them\nI think the difference will come down for a lot of people economically I think we'll see a greater jak was\nIf we have a Republican governor I think that we will see I'm just different policies in general that\nWill separate the two parties and I don't want to make it too much about the two parties have plenty about different political philosophies and the idea that Republicans have fiscally conservative we would like to create more ways to find you know an inspector general's office to ...\nEvidence in the ... when the government to put more effective government to make sure that the government that we have we have a nine point six billion dollar budget\nAnd the state and I don't think anybody can say that that money is being spent as effectively as it could be and that's what I Would like to see the difference to me is that when we do have um I Would like to see how long has our next governor and I think that he would be a steward\nOf uh and and the administration\nLet's go to Kevin a loss annoy you heard the comments from ... ah she's correct in noting that state spending has grown quite a bit over recent history what do you say to her point of view that Alan ... might be more effective in stimulating\nIsland's economy uh I think it'd be the most obvious statement that I completely disagree but let's talk a little bit of ...\nFour years ago we were last economically\nTons of folks were out of work building trades folks were not working unemployment very high and look at where we're at now Rhode Island is on the right track and it's due to a lot of the work that was done by Gina Raimondo is governor a lot of the work that was done by the Democratic general assembly\nWas everything perfect no are there things that we can do better absolutely but we are on the right track and I think that there's every reason for us to keep going\nNow you know Leon and you're going to hear the argument from Allan Fung about things that could be done better yes spending is up in our state budget but the truth is\nWhen we had Republican and independent governors spending was going up on their budgets to cost a lot more money to do the types of things that we need to do as a state to deliver on promises for services and programs for people\nThat's a fact of life but the question fundamentally I think in this election is about leadership and about who has the right approach to lead us\nNot just now but into the future what does Rhode Island gonna look like four years from now and who's best equipped to lead I think on all of the questions that folks care about at least when I hear them talking from education from immigration to\nHealth care you name the issue Gina Raimondo has demonstrated already that she has a plan to get us on track and I think the voters are going to make the choice to vote for her and twenty six days because they recognize she's the best the most qualified candidate moving forward\nBefore we move on to Valerie address I'd like to get a response from Leanne Senate we know Rhode Island is very subject to the national economy and generally the nation's economy has improved since the great recession about ten years ago but does she and a reminder to serve any credit\nFor how Rhode Island's unemployment rate is now the lowest level since two thousand we have seen an increase in shops would you give her any credit for that\n[laughter] I wouldn't give her some credit for that because she is the governor but I think she's the governor and a time when she was able to take advantage of the uptake in the national economy and I think that something that's played to manage I think that if we had a governor who was more I'm concerned about less corporate welfare\nUm that would help out on me as well we're seeing a lot of money going out and tax breaks for large corporations with too few jobs coming into the state and the ...\nAnd I think that we need to level the playing field to have lower taxes for all businesses and the state and to help people not just\nHave lower taxes less regulation at all the things that we always kind of push for but also the idea that when you go to the government that they have to serve you so if you have a business you need to have someone that can help you to tell you which\nClimate you need which regulations you need to follow and we don't have that ... the all the money that we spend it on the people that are employed by the state government it's very difficult to do business with and I stayed and that's something that we need to change well\nLet's bring wrote on college professor Valerie ... into the discussion I Wonder if we could\nBring you up to an eight thousand feet and view of the race for governor as we hear from Kevin and Lee and they're very contrasting views among Democrats and Republicans about who the better candidate is I Wonder what you make of the quality of the race for governor so far\nHas there been a detailed discussion and the issues we know that the candidates try to use their TV ads to shift hubs public opinion has it been more focused on petty partisan attacks what kind of grade she give it to the caliber of discussion during this race for governor\nVery much defined by the fact that we didn't have primary debates with either one of the two candidates and so we didn't have an opportunity for their party opponents or to have a discussion with them about the way that they wanted to govern\nAnd even though this is essentially a rerun race from two thousand fourteen um we're almost speak getting that race at that debates which is a very unusual kind of thing but if I'm if I'm to to look from the sky\nWhen the things that I Would say is that it's very difficult to be the incumbent in better economic times and uh we had conducted at our our college a citizen focus groups at the end of the last debate in two thousand fourteen\nAnd I never had seen such cynical responses and the feeling of pessimism by the Rhode islanders and um I think that that was a product of the economic times that they voted in but they held their nose since they voted\nAnd I think we're in different times right now and that combined with the fact that we really haven't heard much from the candidates except for essentially attack ads\nWhich are both of them are leveling back and forth and addition to our independent candidate a we're almost be just beginning to race\nWell let's shift gears a little bit and it shouldn't be any surprise that there's a lot of division within both of the major political parties in Rhode Island right now the Democratic and Republican parties as at a time of great polarization among Americans\nSo let's start with the Democratic party or a lot of notice earlier this year when there was an endorsement for a former Donald Trump supporter Michael Earnhardt\nWho is waging a primary challenge to a progressive female state rep from Providence moral Walsh a Kevin loss in a way I Know you will tell us that this endorsement was made by a local district committee\nWell I I I have a couple of responses to that it is difficult to in Rhode Island to half of United Democratic Party because it is such a huge tent and this is unusual when you compare it to other states\nAlso we have to consider the rise of progressive in Rhode Island and that's creating some extra attention uh especially with the house speaker and his endorsement of candidates and\nAlso how he viewed some of the issues that the women's caucus the Democratic women's caucus were pushing and were table so so there's there's a little bit of trouble on the rise and also if you look at the fact that\nPeople don't worry about millennials because they believe that they don't vote but those older millennials are coming of age\nThat they're they have mortgages they have children they're starting to think about school systems and they have very different views about women's issues and issues of diversity and both parties need to speak to that\nBut let's shift our discussion to the very fiery us a Senate confirmation fight for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nRhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse got a lot of attention for his questioning of Kavanaugh White House his Republican challenger Robert Flanders called White Houses line of questioning an embarrassment\nBut White House says he was asking appropriate questions that could shed light on the claims made by professor Christine Blasey Ford\nNow Kavanaugh has a seat on the U.S Supreme Court\nLet's stay with Valerie and dress here professor of political communication at rode on college what kind of fall out do you expect from this both in terms of the decisions coming out of the Supreme Court and how this filters down to the local level in places like Rhode Island\nWell it's it's certainly going to widen the gender gap and that's not going to get any better and and perhaps the good fall out is that uh this may not be the year the woman because a lot of women weren't asked to run\nBut the predictions are in two thousand twenty four we're going to see quite a big wave as a result of the Trump presidency and and the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nOn the local level uh I I can look at the image of Gina Raimondo for example and she has been accused of being a woman of ambition of national ambition\nAnd I think she's moved to the transition of the woman who is protecting women's rights in Rhode Island so she's off the hook to some extent on on that issue\nUm and I think that probably Flanders made a mistake on how he handled the questioning of White House again that widens the gender gap and Republicans need all the boats in the world and I thought he had a pretty flippant\nAnd even some Republican women by the way that he responded\nWell let's bring in Lee and Senate cure it seems like they're the two main reactions to the Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing is that many women were upset by it and at the same time Republicans were energized in many parts of the country how do you see the fallout from the Supreme Court and here in Rhode Island\nWell I think that here in Rhode Island and across the country people were definitely energized by that but on both sides and I think the fallout is just the loss of civility\nUm that we've seen coming forward from this and I I find that very disturbing and a local level um and on the national level when we see the reactions that people are having and how divided we seem to be as a country that we can't say we we need to have a national discussion about gender issues about coming together and about\nHow we respond to when when they make allegations and how we protect people from allegations that they can't defend themselves from it's a it's a conversation that we need to have and by just kind of both sides shutting off and choosing sides and being so divisive we're not going to get anywhere so the fall I Would like to see is as having a more civil discourse about it let\nMe ask you about that gender issue because I've seen some female commentators make an observation that Brett Kavanaugh and Senator Lindsey Graham displayed some very sharp anger during the Senate Judiciary hearing and that more often when women display that anger it's perceived more negatively is there a double standard there\nThey're usually in a devastated when women are perceived as ambitious um it's it's a double standard as well just not just showing anger but when you talk about\nWomen showing ambition they're viewed differently than men who and bishop is um and and that's something that needs to change in our country women you know women the only thing holding women back now in this country a women themselves because we can do anything\nWe don't need to answer to command or other women I can be anything that I Want to be in this country today and that's a beautiful thing about being in the United states of America as opposed to some countries are women don't have the right and the freedoms that we do we\nJust need to be able to take advantage of those freedoms and to speak up and stand together when those freedoms infringed upon\nKevin ... many liberal activists across the country and in Rhode Island had particular concern about a conservative justice joining the Supreme Court because the issue of reproductive rights\nWe've seen some democratic lawmakers in Rhode Island pressing for a bill for a few years now to strengthen abortion rights and House Democratic house speaker Nicholas Matty yellow is the gatekeeper for\nLegislation at the state house he says this is too divisive an issue to bring up and that it's there's no productive purpose in having a very sharp and polarizing debate what do you have to say about\nThat the two things so the first thing is I'm just want to respond to something that we had said about having a national conversation around these issues um I agree with her whole heartedly that last week was a really tough week for all of us\nUm and in terms of civility I agree with that I Would just say that it's really hard to have a national conversation when only one party is interested in having that conversation I Can't think of a single Republican in the Senate Judiciary committee or in the Senate male or female\nThat was interested in having a robust conversation about these issues that was very clear to me and I think clear and most people that the ideology that Brett Kavanaugh espoused was all they cared about and so\nWhat do you have ... Senate can opportunity response\nThat well I I don't agree with you there I think that Susan Collins I'm definitely made a\nPlea please keep ... she made a reasoned\nFrom all the different angles and I think that there was a consideration there or I don't think that people didn't just consider ...\nLet me just let me just say what I think are the facts I think that the like it's readily apparent to me and it's ... to appear to anybody that I watch those hearings that one party was interested in a full investigation of the facts related to the sexual assault one party was not interested in doing that\nAll right we've got the two points of view here and we're not going to settle that argument here so we're going to move on to another hurting it topic I mentioned house speaker and Nicholas ... house speaker is often called one of the most powerful officials\nIn Rhode Island and it's a court of road on politics that the speaker has to run for reelection\nFrom his state rep a district every two years in twenty sixteen Republican Steven fries came within eighty five votes of ... of defeating Nicholas Matty yellow and frogs is running against ... again this year we in Seneca how concerned should speaker Mary Elle it'd be that he was going to lose his job\nI think he should be very concerned I think that Steve ... Kennedy and I think that there is just a lot of sentiment\nAgainst the speaker I think he's going into this race weekend there's been several a Democrat that have come out and said they would not support him as a speaker should he be we liked and\nUm but I think that no matter what happens in this race we have to also I'm think Steve from running again and thank everyone who is running and challenging incumbents because they're pushing them to get things done\nAnd that wouldn't have happened that the car tax that Mandela promised at the end of the last election that happened because he had a strong challenger\nSo that democracy that we see in our state doesn't always work but it's working well\nI'm In these specific races and I think that we need to as a speaker also take some of that power back to have somewhat checks and balances there are represented by a new ... very good article in the province gentle talking about some of the things that they can do to lessen the power of the speaker and to make that general assembly a more balanced power by\nMy own lifting the people to the committee's rather than having the speaker had the sole ability to appoint people to committees and to have those committees the only ones that can do their thing so by having a larger voice in those representatives that are there it benefits all of us because they represent us they're not they're\nJust at the will of one person and that's what we've seen in the ... and that's and that's why I think\nWe need to have that conversation again but talking about\nHow we can get those that balance of power into all the representative so they are represented equally\nKevin last night we will come back to you but I Want to go to Valerie interest professor of political human communication wrote on college\nLynch has made two very worthwhile points I think that\nWays of the bay entrance around sixty similar conditions on both during the day but with seas around three feet next tied tied to Newport a little bit after eleven o'clock tonight low tide shortly after for tomorrow morning it's forty\n[noise]\nEven though they're on the next freakonomics radio one of the men who helped rebuild New York city after nine eleven is now helping build the city of tomorrow\nOur mission is really to use technology to redefine urban life and the twenty first century how will the city look different here's one big thing you don't allow traditional vehicles\nInto the district that's next time for economics radio Saturday afternoon left to right after radio lab on the public radio eighty nine points three FM\n[noise]\nThank you were back before a live audience at the Providence Aspen am and before our last break a Democratic Party executive director Kevin a loss of noise\nWas criticizing the record in Rhode Island are the Republican Party Leanne cynic we how we have seen how it's been a struggle to elect more Republican lawmakers as it stands there only eleven Republicans in Seventy five member house and I believe\nFour or five in the thirties member Senate what Republicans need to do differently to win more officers\nWell I think it's it's kind of like a Jack and the giant type of situation at this point why it's very hard to recruit people\nAnd it's very hard to raise money when we don't have money and we don't have people\nSo it it it's kind of chicken and the a thing where we need something to unite our party and to ... I have a standard bearer which I Do think we have\nIn our son and if we can win the governorship I think you're going to see a lot of difference with people actually being able to come forward and step forward in the next few years that will run as Republicans and I think that\nThat's a good thing for the state that competition but I think also when we talk about the makeup of the general assembly one thing that I Would like to just put put out there so that everyone relies one thing that would help us change that make up and make that a little bit more fair is term limits\nUm if we had term limits in the state legislature ... you would see more young people getting involved so that people who were there with experience they're going to stop mentoring those millennials that we're talking about that want to get involved in politics and create those opportunities for them to do more in our state and I think that's really important and I think that's something that\nIs the Republican Party we can't get people to vote on that and when you talk about trying to reduce the power of the speaker and that one person having that power is not going to want to give up that party that people who are\nSo it's hard to get people who have that power to give it up but if we can get them to vote for time limit and give him implement that it's a huge thing and that's a ... for the Republican Party that we can push that that we can get more people in the end up having\nA last night those the dominance of the Democratic party demonstrate the need for term limits for the legislature\nI don't think so because I don't think that term limits are a reflection of whether or not someone affective\nYou know when I vote for somebody in the general assembly what I'm looking for us for that person to be effective and it doesn't matter to me whether that person served eight years or two years what I Want is for them to be able to effectively be able to carry out a policy agenda that I support\nLet's get the academic view on this Valerie interests many Americans have the perception that politics is broken the founding fathers were very smart but they did not envision a need for term limits do you think term limits would be a good thing and run on or not so much\nWell I think it's a moot point you're never going to get the people who are in office devote themselves out of office so I I'm not sure I could even speculate about that but how 'bout how 'bout as\nA hypothetical do you think it would be I mean you know well this came up in the U.S Senate debate this week\nSheldon Whitehouse wanted to Jack Reed who's very well liked as an answer for why term limits are not needed in the U.S Senate but there might be some other lawmakers who were in the legislature who hang on the on a ... they're so\nSure and and I think I think that's the case and I think Lee and it's right that you're not going to given infusion of differing perspectives but particularly in Rhode Island\nAnd end term limits might do it we're like balance the party\nAnd there is increasing calls from from national polling that I've seen that as a result of the Kavanaugh hearings when they looked at the Judiciary Committee that they now want to consider term limits and but that's from the Democrats point of the\nCat got traffic here how about a very brief comment from ... and then Kevin\nVery briefly I Want to speak that ten minutes also speak to the ... I mean come and see why it's so difficult for Republicans ... minority parties to get elected because there is a great deal of power in in incumbency people can reveal that power they used that they use that name recognition that use that platform that they have\nAnd it keeps people down and that's why we should have ten minutes\nI I don't necessarily disagree with that but but the policy prescription for having more competition between political parties in Rhode Island is not term limits that as a quick fix that Republicans are trying to use to open up more seats so they have to be more competitive here is how you actually do this\nYou get down to the grass roots you knock on doors you make phone calls you have a vision for where you want to govern\nYou have a set of values and you try to compete everywhere\nThat is fundamentally infrastructure early what a political party is about\nAnd as I said before the Republican Party in Rhode Island has not done that doesn't have a history of doing that and so instead of prescribing water quick fixes it should probably look inward and ask the question where are you on the issues that Rhode islanders care about and do align with their values and if the answer is no\nLike it has proven to be over time in Rhode Island you will get the results that you get in the general assembly you will get the results that you get in elections where you have five general officers\nAnd you have no idea whether any of them are legitimately going to have an opportunity to win and you rest your hat\nOn a savior like on the phone who has run\nAri briefly modeled from when when you're talking about ... arguing that we actually we didn't hire an executive director for the first time in a few years we've had that and we have for field staff that are out knocking on doors so we are standing that crime wise but it's very difficult to do in this unbalanced state\nLet's shift gears and discuss national politics briefly President Trump is obviously a very polarizing figure\nHe has low overall approval ratings but he's very popular among the Republican base a Valerie entrust you see the Democrats having a someone who could capture the imagination of Americans in twenty twenty and wage a competitive race for president against Donald Trump\nYou know for me to speculate now it seems like a hundred years away and and certainly we could talk about Cory Booker we could talk about Kamala Harris\nWe could talk about the senator and a list with war and in Massachusetts\nA but a lot is going to happen between then and now and it also depend upon\nOr whether the house and Senate term so over\nAnd ... and whether people are energized by that to be president and um you know we we need a sense of unity in this country and we're not getting it from the presidency and there's going to be increased polarization\nAnd so that also creates rank or in in the Democratic party to that they are attacking back\nAnd uh so so right now we're not in a good place uh with with either parties\nLeon Senate Bob Woodward of the Washington Post was in Providence recently he talked about his book on the Trump Administration you sit there are many people who are close to President Trump\nWho think he poses a threat to national and economic security or certainly Trump is love by conservatives for getting a conservative like Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court but does his presidency raise any serious concerns for you\nKnow I think that the tax reform that I'm the president has put forward is good I think the policies that he is way down in the ministry and again and I don't believe you know an anonymous letter posted the newspaper saying that you know there are people inside the White House that are\nVery nervous about that and that's kind of an underground thing there there's an underground movement in the White House that's a concern everybody not just Republicans\nOn the idea that we could have ... in such a way is a dangerous thought on and to have that put out there and honestly with nothing to back that up it is just in response\nBut there was also Bob Woodward's book she's been a reporter in Washington for forty years he broke Watergate and he is very good sources\nBut let's go on to Kevin a loss annoy we see we we see a you know Bernie Sanders Joe Biden around the periphery of presidential candidates\nBoth the experience people who are the love by some Democrats but they're also long in the two where are the young candidates who are going to capture the imagination of democratic voters\nYeah the answer is I don't know and", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "13"}
