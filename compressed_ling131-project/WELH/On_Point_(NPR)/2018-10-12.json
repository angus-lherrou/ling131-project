point thanks for having me on\nSo first of all I mean you you've been long on the record as um as a person who did not support the candidacy of a now president Donald Trump but at what point in time what was the moment where you said now I have to leave the G. O. P. N. Y. that\nThat was that moment occurred the day after the last presidential election\nYou know I was somebody who was viscerally instantly opposed to Donald Trump from the moment that he came down that escalator at Trump Tower\nAttacking Mexicans rapists and murderers I couldn't believe that you had a mainstream candidate who was talking like that and I never imagined that he would win the Republican nomination much less the presidency and so I was very dismayed to see Trump's progress\nFirst in the Republican primaries and then in the general election there was the shock of my life and I think many people's lives to see Donald Trump actually win the presidency and the next day I knew what I had to do which was after a lifetime as a Republican is a movement conservative\nI re registered as an independent because I knew I just knew at that point I could not be part of this Trump provide Republican Party\n... well so I mean seeing movement conservative do what do you mean by that\nI was part of what was known as the conservative movement from a fairly early age I was a conservative columnist at the University of California at Berkeley\nI was an op ed editor at the wall Street Journal editorial page I was a regular writer for commentary in the Weekly Standard I was a foreign policy advisor to three presidential candidates so I was fairly deep within the conservative bubble\nWorking for what I thought was was the good of America and I was shocked and and and perhaps I shouldn't have been shocked I should have seen this all along but I was just a so dismayed\nTo see the kind of message that done to Donald Trump won on which was completely antithetical to the brand of conservatism that I champion which I associate more with people like\n[noise] support from point comes from the listeners of W.

and he's written about why his new book is called the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we have an excerpt of it at a point radio dot org\nAnd you can call and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk or if you're a Republican and you happen to agree with Max Boot about you concerned about where the GOP is headed what do you think we ought to do to address those concerns\nBut if you're a Republican who thinks the party is exactly where it needs to be right now representing your interest in doing so with a full throated passion call us as well what's your thought for ... were at one eight hundred forty three to five five to eight hundred for two three talk\nUh now I'm actually in ... in the last segment you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly\nWhat do you mean by that all the people who who basically flat or has ego including people like Lindsey Graham who once called him a cook and now\nAll talks about how Donald Trump was a superb Gulf or I mean I I I have to our chapter and verse in my ... of of of the circumstance of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if he were the second coming who think that he used the savior of humanity I mean that's unbelievable this was a\nPresident or you know who was only has the support of about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed himself into a Donald Trump called I mean so many people have drunk the crew late including people but I once had respect for it's it's really been a gut wrenching and soul crushing experience for me to see what's going on\nWell uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly\nBut for many of the others um they did heap praise or upon a President Trump now the whole sort of a person by person moment took about eleven minutes we're not going to play all of that obviously we've significantly cut it down but here's some of the the flattery\nThat members of the cabinet war heaping upon the president in June to thousands Seventeen\nFor the office of British\nHe has to leave for our health and Human Services at this pivotal time under your leadership I Can't thank you for the privileges given that show I Want to thank you for three\nThe higher senior staff around him Mr President thank you for the way I serve your agenda\nMr President radar traveling around the country for the last year an even greater are her to be here serving in your cabinet\nSo you heard their vice president Mike Pence then secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price transportation secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\nA now ... you know many of these people can you explain a they're they're ... seemingly unquestioning unquestioning feel the to the president\nIt's it's really a cult and what the un I think that they feel it's necessary because they understand\nUh that that Donald Trump as a egomaniac who's also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's his cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on but you know that that tape that you played some is to my mind\nIs one of the most revolting on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this is not what should be happening\nIn the White House the people's houses in our constitutional republic where we do not elect Donald Trump as king you're supposed to be the president charged with enforcing the laws and yet he is being treated\nBy those around him as if he were the leader of a religious cult it's profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this ... is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity and this party is around the president of the United states\nWell forgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think the politicians have a higher duty to the country into the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans but I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham an on and on and on\nWho have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in\n... in public what I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is utterly unfit to be president and why won't they do that because they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the\nThe Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against them he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people but worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better to lose reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their way very very dismaying to see ...\nLet me see I'm trying to figure out the right way to ask it but it but can't the argument would be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles though are what got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your list here for support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho who cast their vote for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of a of international elitism gone or wry that that was that was money and effort that should have been spent right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nA principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War in two thousand three patients those same people surrounding themselves or or\nThe ball in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including\nThe mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that\nDiscredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy\nAnd I I write in the book and in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and soul searching way about my own responsibility for getting here\nI was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with Seventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than than most of that Seventy two percent and for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounce my decision and now with\nThe clarity of hindsight and looking back in and trying to figure out my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a queen breast of it in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nIn I was wrong to have advocated the war this is a terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I\nAnd I think the other you know supporters and architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's of course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though you won't end but it now but but there's no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way\nA in open the way to Trump ism which you know I think is is a catastrophe for America and the world far worse than what we've seen in the past because he is\nA you know undermining our democracy with those attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad undermining American allies he's opening the way for dictators so you know this is the terrible situation boat you know we have to be honest and and and admit\nThat the Republican establishment was not blameless in getting us here\nYeah well we're speaking with max ... is our his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk a max it's got a couple of callers here if we can let's first go to Mike who's calling from winter veal North Carolina Mike you're on the air\nMax yes\nI agree with your analysis completely I think Trump an absolutely horrible president I was telling all my friends I could vote against them in the primaries\nBut leaving a party a terrible mistake we need to fight for our party and hope that someone like I have a mental block on flakes name or ... or some decent Republican comes in and challenge if he still president twenty twenty\nTo fight against him leaving the party is is just wrong\nThey make this way and turn it back to Mexico let me ask you mean you mentioned Jeff Flake as I take it Jeff Flake Bob Corker all these are Republicans who who are choosing to retire rather than to continue their political career and I don't hear any of them seem to going to run for president so it seems like there's there's no room for them at all in the party\n...\nSupport for on point comes from college fine where consulting work with high school students to

Megan ... a thanks for taking my call so I'm a I'm a moderate Democrat probably closer to independent and my concern is that I recognize that there's value in bowl\nConservatism of protecting individual rights\nWhile at the same time trying to come together society girl society and my biggest concern is that you see these fringes that are just pushing further further right and left\nShe both protect the greedy and protect the lazy or respectively so you know it seems like gosh I'm getting pulled in these two directions and\nUh you know here's how Trump or you know polling point pulling towards the greedy and his minions and it just it is incredibly frustrating for people like me in the middle that uh you know can't find a way so just wondering if you could comment on that\nSteven thanks for your call next to go ahead\nOh I feel Steven's point in time you know I feel exactly the same way I I'm politically almost like I Can't be part of this Trump or five Republican Party but I don't feel comfortable being part of the Bernie Sanders\nElizabeth Warren party either and so on you know I'm I'm stranded in the middle I think you know look I think Democrats have an opportunity here because I think there are a lot of disaffected voters who could not be part of what Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I I'm In that category\nIf Democrats I think go to the center there can be a historic realignment of American politics of the kind that you saw in the Nineteen thirties that would make the Democrats the majority party\nHe was by a nominating somebody who was pretty centrist in twenty twenty and not going to to the progressive extreme\nWell the all the forces that we've seen in terms of the primary process in terms of campaign finance the things that are be leader the Republican Party some of the things that ... Republican Party also beleaguered the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think they are in the in the twenty twenty cycle the ... the Democrats might actually\nNominate a centrist versus someone who's on the more progressive wing\nOr the anything is possible I mean who would've imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump or twenty sixteen so we don't know who the Republican not who the Democratic nominee who's going to be twenty twenty but there is no question that almost all of the\nMajor contenders that people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees are certainly from the progressive wing of the party and that concerns me as somebody who's who's more of a of a centrist center ripe a person\nYeah let's go to Joe who's calling from St Petersburg Florida Joe you're on the air\nAll right thank you and I guess my my question has to do with the fact that a Christian I talked to a lot of my friends out and let me see strained politics most of my friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say that the Republican\nOut where I'm most of my other friends might be other combinations are some type of liberal Democrat or when I find that people that aren't religious are Republican\nBut they they are minority whatnot it usually has to do with the money that they act and wanting to be able to preserve their money for their future so my question is it as a liberal Democrat Chris\nI thought is that for the good of the world where it's supposed to take care of each other and all her point of our government is to make sure that everybody gets by and everybody has the ability to either happiness\nOn my question what was the original point of having a conservative wing of the party back when you join and get it a lot of the religious right in any way sway your decision to at the end of the\nJoke I think yeah Jo thanks for your call go ahead max\nWell the religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties or in it's dismaying to me to see what happened with with with with that one of the party that you have until it goes I mean I agree with a lot of them in in the late Nineteen nineties when they were cast the getting Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these arch more or less than ... colds who are criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions then you know this is a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off\nA playboy playmate on a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a president who has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of\nOf of a bill Bennett ... book from Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen Ninety nine called the death of outrage where he was lamenting the fact that more people were not outraged about Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrage is actually pretty good description\nOf the of the of the Christian right a today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say about the shocking immorality of the president that they support\n[noise] ... I Want to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's this question with this issue of race\nOr and and how that\nIs shaped direction the Republican Party is going in because\nI'm I I'm thinking of um\nYou know the number of times you pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people look to Clinton said that that was racist but did you ... around him\nGoing so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks button but nevertheless I'm going to still support the ... the United states because of all he's helping deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important to a lot of people so far as long as that you know your your term ... bargain exist what hope do you have\nA for change if the if the change has to come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated and devastating defeats\nThey have to know there'll be a political price to pay for trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political game there is nothing I've seen in American political life in my lifetime that as more despicable than those they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he's for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his race has baggage when he refers to Latino immigrants as snakes and animals who breathing in fast he\nCalls African countries [noise] you know he says neo Nazis or find\nPeople he locks up children of undocumented immigrants this is a disgrace and the Republican Party is displacing itself by\nGoing along with us well\nLet's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Ira you're on the air\n... backs food food I Would like to take my hat off to you I Am in total application of the courage to your show and the intelligence analysis you will absolutely correct\nAbout the current situation it can be no doubt any man and woman on Saturday face down from really lead a call now from what he is a true ...\nTotal dictator and another Hitler however I'd like to tell you\nThere's no need to be another despair we our great nation we went through the ... the fact of the civil war and we find out what words together don't choke I'm sixty is to fully do it we pretty much on it now but the one people who will never recover\nA as a democracy we will recover but evangelists people who supported Trump eighty one percent and now when Ninety One percent they shall never recover their their ... there'd be a religious people more people\nI ...

Alexis ... an on point news analyst Jack Beatty I also want to remind listeners that we are tracking or what's going on with her ... excuse me tropical storm Michael\nAnd you can find news of that are all day and all weekend on NPR's a broadcast and also on line that NPR\nDot org I Do want to turn to uh\nTo the climate report done by the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental planet a panel on climate change as commissioned by the United nations uh which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage during an interview with on point on Tuesday ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explain that past climate change models have been if anything much too conservative\nAnd that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe'd seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we'd seen the occurrence of these extremes go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or have if anything didn't kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we went back in the eighties\n[noise] total ... how is the government responding to this a panel this this report\nAh without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives that much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know\nTry to talk about how climate change is a hoax he said that in the past than\nA dozen is racing has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states it's it's an agreement that basically all of the countries in the world agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact and the onset of of climate change\nUh this is a president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and ah as you said it's putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\nOr I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts\nHi thanks for taking my call Yes sir I think that I think the biggest driver of climate change is not all people in their everyday lives to turn away from it there's no bigger issue in this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claimed to\nSay that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing enforcing those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a Bob uh Alexis I'm asked totally what actions have been taken a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\nWell I you know one element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and uh the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are discovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if\nThis report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas the\nThe issues at stake are quite dire need this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of a new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine a Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing in that it's already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House\nAh and at that time the newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh assured Americans he would be an independent impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of\nThe Supreme Court's team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open mind\nJack Beatty you've heard the new justice or can you uh uh feel assured that he'll listen to the litigants arguments with respect or an open mind\nWell he had to say that didn't they based on his\nLittle Philip in front of the Senate committed attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except bin ... come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nAh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him a lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough the challenge of this poses to the G O P or some people call it the ground oil party which has deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames Hansen the climate scientist and a recent paper says we will go to negative admissions now basically for\nTrillion just five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pull the carbon it's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies\nWhere does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need the universal health care\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from the cost of the party that caused by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about uh the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization will crisis\nAlexis ... is there any sense going back to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that are that the Republicans will pay a price for a for a cabin are what they did that now look as though there'll be a little bit used by the the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these races very carefully they're suggesting I take you to Mitch McConnell has been doing some victory lap sort of interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling ahead are doing better than they thought they might in\nA state that they would normally be thought of to be winning and a Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is eager to say that that little bumpy thinks is coming from what happened with cabin on fact\nAs you know in the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect even though he said it wasn't planned that way\nTo be so contentious right before the election I'm at and a Democrat is not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated and might themselves be very motivated about what they saw particularly women\nWomen voters but uh the Democrats are not disputing that Republicans have have perhaps gotten a little bit of a bump\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from the listeners have WVU are often and your NPR station from the music emporium guitar seller since

Folkenflik and I'm Talking about the week's top stories with Alexis ... nerve they're held\nTo Lou ... of Bloomberg and on point news analyst Jack Beatty you can join the conversation what other stories are moving you this week what's on your radar what's not getting enough coverage where one hundred forty three to five five ... hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook\nAt on point radio uh one of our callers are called to admonished us for spending time on ... visit to the White House at all but I think it's part of the piece of understanding where are the president is coming from what's on his mental landscape what does he sharing with us\nHe also had some a sharp words at a rally a in Council Bluffs Iowa on Tuesday the president had harsh words for those who oppose him\nHand match join our son is\nAnd you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats [noise]\nWe've heard a lot of rhetoric from Republicans about the Democrats in their opponents being ... where's this rhetoric coming from\n[noise] well yeah and you know let's just get it for the ... called the Democrats evil the party of crime they want to destroy our country liberals are quote very very bad people\nYou know in the ah October nineteenth two thousand sixteen debate the president was ... then candidate Trump was asked will you will by by the results of the election\nAnd he said I Will look at it at the time I Will keep you in suspense it could be rigged\nNow we have to be in suspense about two thousand and twenty is it likely that the president will turn over power should the Democrats win to a party that is what destroying our country very very evil\nYou know you it we've reached the point where this sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is ed lose\nMy heavens writing in the Financial Times it's no leap to imagine Trump refusing to accept election defeat that's that's a along step\nFrom where we are but certainly the rhetoric is charged he's talking about mob rule elect to some degree you've been hearing that from a congressional figure some of them on Capitol Hill as well what are you hearing that's driving that rhetoric what did they point to and and ... you know what is it really grounded on\nWell first of all when we first started to hear this discussion about an angry mob it was a talking point it was very clear because Republicans including the president were all speaking with the same voice so it had been focus grouped it was a talking point and pollsters were suggesting\nAnd part of this is because an election season no matter what party here and you're trying to draw very sharp contrast and mobilize your own base to turn out and we know that Republicans had been very concerned that their base is not as mobilized her as excited about turning out in the mid term election ... Democrats may be so\nI don't look yeah when you just stop you there to help underscore your point a during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend ... valley resident Dorothy new clothes told our co host magnet chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protests from Democrats\nThe Democratic party so far to the left and\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the global is [noise] and ... until ... sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around with Philippe ads on their heads\nAnd science and everything that goes I mean they're just they're everywhere\nAnd that's from on points that field reporting from Pennsylvania a in that case about how congressional redistricting the redistricting is affecting states\nHotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point radio dot org but electric to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of mobs than simply that people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly as a constitutional right that's hardly seems like ... to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line at of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself has very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nAre often insights a mob reaction himself\nBut I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to drop sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race in New York and defeated a Joe Crowley long term incumbent\nAnd ... is running as a socialist that there were lots of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rubbed together in the Republican Party about why we can really use is because the effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being pulled to the left to the left to the left\nYou know you can see that there are a variety of candidates who are interested in perhaps running for president or in these house races that fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's this tension and it's almost as though they're seen as in parallel but sense of kind of different to me about tension about whether to be pulled it left\nA among Democrats and you've seen that play on some congressional primaries and races and also tension about how strongly teach you fight for a you know political success\nOr earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later\nWhen I say you know we don't do anything for ... you'll do anything illegal but we're going to be tough and we're going to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king when the young\nYou know almost all gave to us so you'd be taken away that's the thing to do they want to maintain\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams a ... in Georgia a lot of Republicans and conservatives took great\nWildly inappropriate he further clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the the the little the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones and the un incite violence or and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on in the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president\nTo turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats are socialist they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks it's if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line tacked tactics like\nHolding open the Supreme Court seat for a year and they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat for our policies and there's a debate between that and and the idea that we need more civility in our politics we're going to beat them by going high when they go low and that internal debate is still playing out and it's been\nHappening in different ways and different parts of the country we've seen more moderate Democrats win and some places we've seen democratic socialism progressive went in other places and uh what's going to happen in November is going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward in twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan steeply gotcha what's on your mind\nHi I Am calling that with the crush all over

year push and many states to restrict access to voting\nAnd we normally think of voting as a as a something that has been move advancing forward and we've been increasing access to the franchise since our founding um but really in the last decade I'm twenty four states have put in place new laws that make it harder for eligible citizens almost house\nAlmost half the states I mean this includes things like the three examples you gave the most common are very strict voter id requirements but there are cutbacks to voter registration access cutbacks to early voting\nCutbacks to polling sites

Abrams excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday discuss the tens of thousands of voter registration applications currently on hold it in the state of Georgia she is accused her home in blind camp of repressing citizens right to vote\nThat challenge is this process called exact match\nAnd we've been fighting on that sets twenty fourteen\nWhat happens is if you have a hyphen in your last name if he'd have a difficult spelling if anyone misspelled or lead it leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically as a reason to not processor registration and that means that if that fifty three thousand Georgians currently have their registration intending status\nTechnically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not processed and so we're deeply worried that fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised\nWhat would Brian Kemp say if he were here and how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to challenge no I'd like to hear it handles someone like I'm Brian Kaplan I guess when he would say is we need to make sure that the people who are registering are actually the people who they claimed to be and therefore we need to impose strict standards on\nWhether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor type though like I'm missing hyphen or the transition of two letters when a someone's entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing to underscore I think there's um the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote\nIn November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that's not a perfect solution because provisional ballots are counted under different rules um than regular ballots but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged\nOr I'd like to take a call now from awake cross Georgia John go ahead you're on the air\nYes I was calling I'm about the uh the um now when you file your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license information in\nTo get your tax return process including earned income credit\nOther credits that the people that you are saying are being disenfranchised um how's that because they want to get those refunds so so\nI don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThink you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nI heck you for taking my call just certain what bothers me is\nIt's rarely discussed is the fact that every one of these voter ID laws is always tied to serious restrictions to access to the polls\nEither reducing the polling places pulling time um when the clerks offices are open to file absentee ballots which was the case here in Wisconsin so there's it's not just about ... if it's to me that undermines his argument it's about voter fraud it's\nAbout reducing people's rights to vote\nOkay thank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help or address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state\nFor the state of Alabama since taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters had been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcomed on point\nDavid great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYes sir tell me just from the ... what's your approach to ah to to having voters on the roles\nWell David we will agent every eligible US citizen this resident of Alabama to be registered to vote and have a photo lab date\nAnd we have gone to extra links to make sure that people accommodate whenever that occurs\nAnd we did all six seven counties at least one time every year with our mobile units as well as having our board registrars office opened each and every day that the court houses open and all six to seven county\nAnd we visit festivals events and activities in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one now I Will also tell you\nThat in the rare instances where people say hey I

Alabama ... some of the specifics interest 'cause he's maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless ...

think we are doing their jobs are scarce members by not allowing military ... than all fifty eight\nAnd for creating such a huge gap in allowing him and now\nAlex thank you so much for sharing that perspective I really appreciate at one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about today's voter fraud in part because there's so little evidence that really happens I think that there was one survey done something like eight hundred million\nVotes cast over a fourteen year period and there were maybe scores of of of of allegations that seem credible maybe a hundred or two hundred\nA but the but the concern was talked about a lot particularly twenty sixteen raised by the president and a lot of his supporters\nThere really isn't a lot of evidence to support that nonetheless it's as we've all it tested there is a desire to ensure that people legitimately have the right to vote and these things when ... when the wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill he's ... state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well so I wanted to build up with\nThe last caller talked about the difficulty of or at least many Americans to register to vote and um the secretary marrow was very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree\nThat it should be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls and with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... a modernized the system so it's not just relying on\nAds in papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices but we're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem I'm Thirteen states and D.C have already adopted that in the last three years alone and there's been really bipartisan support in momentum and that really works to expand voter registration and to do so in a much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary Merrill\nAbout um whether he is I'm interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWill know windy outside you know without me but I Will see any way\nThat we have to make in the last three years now much and twenty three days\nAnd voter registration per capita nobody more than we do it nobody would we don't get when football I think you can also like to know when it come get automatic voter registration what you're what you're talking about\nThere's a different definition for what automatic voter registration rain\nNow one of the questions that outrage whenever somebody energy concept to me\nAnd in your state but there should be an opt out provision\nAnd opt out provision would mean that if somebody shows now I Do want to be registered than they should be given the opportunity to keep from being registered when they engage in that activity would be getting in your driver's license getting social services or whatever happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I immediately tell them is that what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we have nine to three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very excited about that\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's\nEver been in a system where you have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and that the yield very very different levels of participation in the abstract you might think that those things\nAren't very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of oxygen system through the DMV right now\nOther states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates\nSky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that used to create an opt out says so we're getting callers you're suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington\nVirginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid thank you take one call ... windy day of secretary Marilyn Monroe you specifically um would you think of potentially a creating a holiday whether it be a state holiday are you going to propose that perhaps the national level to\nUm have an official day off for voting whether or not they'd be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually votes oh I'll take the response off the air thank you thanks very secretary\nBarry I think it's important to know that it's\nBeen my observation in my experience that people vote when it's important to and if you say well if we had voting on Saturday or had voting on a day that was specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase\nThe turnout well when we broken every record in the history of the state in the last three major elections we've had the empirical data\nAs bill said speaks for itself which is that people come when they want to vote we\nHad second secretary ... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously recognition turnout is actually Yes sir I'm Sorry state Folkenflik ... ... you know there's obviously really interest to win a one more and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama race right\nAfter ... and people really turned out but what would make you think that people are ... wouldn't have turned out more if they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that uh that takes pole and they were\nBecause this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing to point one million Alabamians go polls Seventy two percent of people that were registered voter\nSound like a guy you sound like a guy to me who's very much in quest of a hundred percent participation of people who can do it right well I like the company like that's your desire\nTo that's that's what I said earlier\nWe won't each and every eligible US citizen that's raised in Alabama to be registered to vote and to be able to participate and have a voter ID card and to be able to participate at the level they want to participate\nBut I don't know why some people vote and some people don't if I knew that I'd rather both salad and I wouldn't be sectors date anymore I'd be a multimillionaire\nWe'll have you on the second hour on friday will enjoy yourself very much I'd like if they feel you still hope to to to weigh in here I just wanted to say because I've Returned Merrill's observation about when people want a vote 'em but they vote and just\nPicked up to ... uh uh would logically implies\nRight if we think the only reason that people don't vote is because they're not interested in voting than what we're saying is that in the United states where we have turn

mitigate damage during an interview with on point on Tuesday ... del ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explained that past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative\nAnd that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nSeen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of feet extremes go up so\nThe models or if ... if anything been kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of dangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we went back in the eighties\nTotal ... them or how is the government responding to this ... this this report ah without\nMuch action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives that much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know\nTry to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nA half dozen is racing has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states it's it's an agreement that basically all of the countries in the world a agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact in the onset of climate change\nUh this is a president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and ah as you said it's putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\nOr I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call Yes sir I think the I think the biggest driver of climate change is denial but people in their everyday lives to turn away from it\nThere's no bigger issue in this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claim to\nSay that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing enforced in those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a Bob uh Alexis I'm asked totally what actions have been taken a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\nWell I don't want an element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and uh the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are discovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if\nThis report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nIt sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas of\nThe issues at stake are quite dire indeed this is an issue obviously weird on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in other new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine or Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing in that as he'd already been formally sworn in buddy\nThe newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh shirt Americans he would be an independent impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of the Supreme Court team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and walls protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nJack Beatty you've hurt the new justice or can you uh feel assured that listen to the litigants arguments with respect or an open mind\nWell he had to say that didn't he based on who is a\nLittle ... in front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except big guys the come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nUh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him a lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough to challenge this poses to the GOP or some people call it the ... party which is deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames Hansen the climate scientist and a recent paper said either we will go to negative admissions now basically for\nWe will have to invest eighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pull the carbon in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies\nWhat does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need the universal health care\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from it costs at a party that caused by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization or crisis\nA Lexus emitting or is there any sense going back to to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that uh that that the Republicans will pay a price for a for cabin are what they did that now look as though there'll be a little bit used by that the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these racist very carefully they're suggesting on ticketed Mitch McConnell has been doing some victory lap sort of the interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling ahead are doing better than they thought they might in\nA state that they would normally be thought of to be winning and a Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is ear to say that that little bumpy thinks is coming from what happened with cabin on fact\nAs you know in the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect\nEven though he said it wasn't planned that way to be so contentious right before the election I'm at and a Democrat not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated and might themselves be very motivated about what they saw particularly women\nWomen voters but uh the Democrats are not disputing that Republicans have have perhaps gotten a little bit of a

me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line at of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself as very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nAre often insights a mob reaction himself\nBut I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to drop sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race in New York and defeated a Joe Crowley long term incumbent\nAnd ... is running as a socialist that there were lots of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rubbed together in the Republican Party\nThere is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being pulled to the left to the left to the left and you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are anticipating perhaps running for president or in these house races\nThat fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's this tension and it's almost as though they're seen as in parallel but sense of kind of different to me about tension about whether to be pulled it left\nA among Democrats are and you've seen that plant some congressional primaries and races and also tension about how strongly to fight for a political success\nOr earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later\nWhen I say you know we don't do anything if you don't do anything illegal we've got to be tough and we have to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king's when the young\nYou know all those folks gave to us that can be taken away that's the thing to do they want to maintain\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose he uh they said you know this is a wildly inappropriate he further clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the the the the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones and the un incite violence uh and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on in the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president\nTo turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crying to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate and the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line tacked tactics like\nHolding open the Supreme Court seat for a year they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat for our policies\nAnd there's a debate between that and and the idea that we need more civility in our politics we're going to beat them by going high when they go low and that internal debate is still playing out and it's been happening in different ways in different parts of the country who seemed more moderate Democrats win and some places we've seen\nDemocratic socialism progressive when and other places and uh what's gonna happen in November is going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward and twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan\nHi I Am calling on that with the question or comment a general observation and that is I've heard uh on two different NPR talk shows this morning this batting back and forth about a Democrats\nAre hysterical because we say that Trump but it was administrator fascists like and all sorts\nTerrier I however it's not an intellectual
