little bit from the beginning of the book of because it's very beautifully told and I love to have listeners a get a feel for it\nThank you this is just from the very beginning of the book\nThe story my mother told me about them was always the same your birth parents had just moved here from Korea they thought they wouldn't be able to give you the life you deserved\nIt's the first story I can recall one that would shape a hundred others once I was old enough and brave enough to go looking\nWhen I was still young three or four I've been told I Would crawl into my mother's lap before asking to hear it her arms would have been circled me solid and strong where I was light pale and faculty against my like brown skin\nSometimes in these half a magic memories I picture her and the dress she wore in our only family portrait from this era lilac with flood our sleeves and oddly delicate choice for my solid and sensible mother\nAt that age of shiny black bull cut and things would have framed

transracial adoption or and and her search for her identity and what difference it made her when she actually sought out the truth of the story of her biological family were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nUh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in your life\nUm but but there's just the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nWant to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt among okay hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think part of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not of the of adopted children mind you but\nAnd I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that that your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race\nI mean thinking about this from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is um I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just\nThings I Wish I had in my toolkit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed this to me that they wish they had\nBeen offered more in the way it information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing that I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with him about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family\nUm that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know I'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we've gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you know they ask many questions just nobody really was telling them either some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how your answer\nAnd you know nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to ... to have those conversations I think okay\nNow so I can hear it and fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about uh was was something difficult enough to handle 'em or know know what to do with how to come through that but in addition to that\nWas there was there all along and\nThat you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of was there a longing weren't emptiness for something that you felt that needed to be filled because of you know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're compulsion as you saw with your parents [noise]\nI think it was it wasn't so much an empty nest or like I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did kingly feel once I was old enough to notice and once I was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly\nI'm In a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable um\nI don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships in great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt it I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like very white schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family there was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this is guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true\nThat that might not be an can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what matters finally decided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in the book my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I haven't become a parent but other times I'm convinced\nThat I would've eventually search no matter what you know it's nothing that have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious I wondered um I had gotten a little bit of information um that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names addresses but like general very general information\nI got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew sort of what a search would involve\nUm but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final punished I remember sitting at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birth\n'em and why I was born so prematurely um because I was I was born about ten weeks early and you and I don't know I had no answer that was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and child birth it just\nI don't know something about my ... knowing my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family but I was really scared and also\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay as what I have done that for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nAnd and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think every parent go through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child\nAnd they can only those questions only become far more acute when there's so many\nOn answered a issues in in the the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers who want to join us and uh and I just want to get at least a couple of them here\nTo be able to share their stories but can you hang on for a second one I Will they will ... absolutely let's go to Jim who's calling from El

six weeks old\nAnd the other uh when he was two years old um and there was a year a difference between them so um my my story starts when they're like a four years old and three years old [noise] and um they're all grown up now other twenty and Twenty one\nBut a a one day we're walking through the uh Walmart parking lot and just me and them and I've got one by chance and a kind of out of nowhere

black and you know right then it's like oh goodness I didn't think I'd have to have this conversation in the Wal Mart parking\nLot you know mhm I'm so I'm ... I go well\nHe started oh isn't it I go to answer him\nAnd my younger son jak who is lighter skin um he stops he stops right away three years old he stops key rips his hand out of my hand and he says I'm not black and white huh\nAnd so now I turn to him because oh my goodness I I hadn't thought about\nHow they view themselves you know yeah and uh you know the younger one he was a a a mixture of a you know African American and Hispanic\nAnd he was just lighter skin and an Isaac was a African American and and Caucasian and was a little bit darker skin right and now I'm now ... now my focus shifts and I'm like well and before I get the answer might the older son looks across me to his brother and says\nMm [noise]\nSupport for on white comes from the listeners of W.

I don't know how\nIs that unusual not really isn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment birth parents get the least\nAnd they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more loss and trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so at this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there are so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every story is a case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's the whole family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of her sisters\nDid you know ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is\nDid that process than help uh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family do to get you to the place that you would hope you were hoping to to to go to I think\nThe primary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched or just simply kind of gaps and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or other other factors I certainly cared about\n'em I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is\nOne of the reasons I searched but I think it was really from my sister is especially my full sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information I'm In a she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always feel I I I wasn't really part of this family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nPlease thought a medical history and if I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that so much Cindy Cindy was and this was her family family the only ones who got and I think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers\nAnd that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps and knowledge [laughter] well this is obviously an issue that has had an impact\nOn many people's lives 'cause we've got a stack of callers and I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call\nUm I was raised in the south or in the sixties and seventies and adopted Fifteen Years ago a beautiful young man from a lot of law and my question is is I don't have any experience how do I prepared on my son for a living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experienced racism\nJohn yeah I had you know lived an upper middle class life ah went in the military where there's very little racism than you know I'm just not face those issue yeah how do I prepare my son to go out in the world he knows he's very dark he's you know going to face these things I don't know what to tell a\nJewish do you have an answer for John well I you know they're at the huge question but one of the answers is to make sure you surround yourself with people of color especially you know if he's African American um you know make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for on models for him\nAnd that you look for help for you ah you know the best people to help you to understand how to deal with racism or people who have experienced it\nAnd so ... and it's also good for him to see you claiming these people who are like him and not just him yeah let's go to Dina who's calling from Glen falls New York dinner you're on the air\nHi um I'm a white parent of two Asian um daughters Asian American now uh we began our adoption process

attend numerous workshops throughout the process\nAnd a few of them involved adult adoptees who\nUm [noise] um where people of color are adopted by white parents who shared their stories which in many

I was eating and\nYeah they had a they had some trouble I don't know they didn't have my phone number or something [noise]\n[laughter] it's interesting this day and age the Nobel Committee sometimes that's trouble reaching out to people who are who they have they deemed have changed the world here and you mentioned your wife I should mention her as she ... she's a she's a co researcher with us in just can't Samia therapies right that a positive ... Iraq\nYes we work together she's a a gentle you're in a college is terrorism the innocent it together we went to a group called them you know therapy platform where we are trying to really understand the impact of these new drugs on the on the immune system and how they interact with each other and trying to optimize the treatments to make them more effective for more people\nBases Rhode Island public radio [noise]\nSupport for on point comes from W.

I mean how many immunotherapy is are are are out there right now well we\nHave um Fifteen cancer indication Fifteen indication so Fifteen specific cancer conditions that are now proof have drugs approved by the U.S FDA\nFor treatment using him you know therapies um but what's another fascinating thing about our field is there are literally thousands at last count about two thousand different new immunotherapy drugs agents approaches\nThat are currently undergoing clinical testing so the field has just been blown wide open by\nBy the proof of principle that untangle ing this biology can have a true transformative effect on patient flags and I just jump in here in a landslide [laughter] two thousand currently and development or in clinical trial\nDifferent agents from hitting different ... different components of the immune system\nUm are all undergoing clinical testing across and when's the last time cancer research has seen that kind of explosion in potential therapies\nWell I don't think ever I mean this is really this is really a completely new era and you know we really have to acknowledge that why are we here we're here because there's been a tremendous investment\nYou know on the part of our government on the part of of of uh industry in understanding tumor biology in a very deep level and that understanding is leading to so many different possibilities for for treatment of care\nThat they I Wonder if I ... I Would I Want to just\nInject a little bit of not skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong because I remember awhile ago maybe a generation ago\nThere was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman research and Andrew genesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of any and all cancers in the body very exciting let a research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement ...\nMagnet you couldn't have possibly picked a better example um you know we didn't plan on this but um you know one of the things I'm sure\nWork that Dr Folkman did to look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Allison's group is developed with ... with came out of his work\nAnd the combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that in with activating the taking the breaks off the T cell is producing even better responses in some tumors so at that nothing goes wasted so\nThat's that's correct in the run of the things that we're realizing\nThat or is this coming from and ... um\nThere's just some you know therapy can be combined with or not on the other amino therapies but with conventional therapies like chemotherapy or is your son Andrew Andrew genesis therapies are virtually anything that Charles tumor cells can be used to prominence in response so that's why there's so many combinations out there so many\nBut we've we've got a really\n... have died either before decided ... yeah combination of Scoville or else would you know we're going to be going down a lot of false leads\nAll right well you know we've got a lot of callers who want to join us because obviously cancer is a huge issue that does have an impact on so many people's lives\nYou're listening to sour to Jim Allison he was awarded the ... the twenty Eighteen Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work in cancer immunotherapy he shares at a word of the ... of Kyoto University\nAnd you're also hearing from Monica ... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology

where we are with cancer research and why they're so much excitement around him you know therapies\nAnd cancer treatment and I'm joined today by the two thousand Eighteen Nobel Prize winner in medicine and physiology Jim Alison you share the word with to sue hundreds of Kyoto University\nGym Alison as chair of the department of immunology at Mt Anderson Cancer center were also joined by Monica ... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology\nAnd a little earlier in the show Dr Britain hughley told us that we've never seen an explosion in terms of the number of possible treatments or therapies for cancer as we are seeing right now some two thousand\nDifferent treatments in the pipeline the researcher clinical trial pipeline and it's a very exciting moment in cancer research but Dr Britain you only just before the break we're also talking about how how individualized these therapies can be so are we talking about you know slightly different therapies tailored for from person to person\nOh perhaps um you know I there is a whole\nUm emphasis right now on understanding the individual biology of every patient and being able to target that specifically\nUm that not only helps us develop treatments that work better it helps us develop treatments that have fewer side effects you know many examples of this and it's a general direction I Believe we're heading and all of oncology and I see\n[laughter] ... yes in fact just to add a burden earlier was told you wrote the adage institutions recognize we know now that many of those or ... or ... or you're part of the costs of different process itself\nAnd so it was a big effort arm in arm involved in summer but there's many many groups\nTry to develop rapid whereas a genome sequencing has that gets faster and cheaper to deter for possible around ... politically or man you're the person ... along with with through\nA checkpoint blockers or perhaps would be much much lower doses of focus for a response even more tightly I'm On my gesture shows themselves well\nJim Nelson and Monica Britain nearly um we've got a comment here this come in on our website and that the person wants us to to make a point that I I wanted to ask you about\nSome of the ... come and calling themselves planes dealers says I Hope that in addition to the brilliant scientists involved the show addresses the practical impact in other words the prices of these therapies\nAre I mean it's a ... to start with you I mean I'm seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars as it costs for some of these therapies is that is that right\n[noise] yes yes that's correct and it's um\nI can understand some of it because I'm a development I'm reporting for example changed all the rules to standard\nAnd Poor's to choose chronicled for evaluating drugs that target address your sales were useful anymore to a lot of federal trials because we use the wrong and points and showed researchers are developmental costs were immersion cars will probably most expensive over I'm not sure [noise]\nBut still that's no that's no reason to keep those prices for an hour because we certainly don't reflect the costs too much of a drug it's also got to come down project we're as we go to the combinations where my\nHeart you know from remembers outside or butter or going to hope to become known for ... for more Persians\nYeah Monica Britain usually I mean I Know that new neither you a gym or setting prices are for drugs that are that are coming out of clinical trial I Want to acknowledge that ah and also we've heard frequently over the many years and and Jim just pointed to it that the development costs are these drugs are very high because sometimes that we're talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean both of you are in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because their costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots it when it comes to availability to an access to to health care in the United states\nWell that went in there now ... you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and you know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs\nIt's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus\nWhat we can do as doctors and his researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients in the best most efficient way\nBecause then it's it's not so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more is when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and has not and really as as clinicians and researchers that's where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to Lucy who's calling from Jupiter, Florida Lizzie you're on the air\nHello Hi Lucy go ahead\nOh hi thank you for taking my call 'em I wanted to counter all this talk of excitement with my experience of frustration over you know therapy I'm fifty two years old I was diagnosed with advanced\nStage three ovarian cancer which statistically has a terrible survival rate uh like I'll be very very very lucky if I was still alive and five years and yet every day on NPR I hear about these clinics with all this and you know therapy but there's not for me and so my question to your research here it is for someone like me\nHow many years I have to try to stay alive you can have actual methods of treatment until someone comes up with an air either got pro in my life [laughter] you know ...\nHang on don't don't hang up the phone here I'd let me just turn to Jim Allison first a ...\nHer yeah I mean one of the one of the roof shot but about immunotherapy is because there's a lot of transfers the were uniformly fertile before a bitter now responding unfortunate but all respond I'm In ... group ... really responded much at all yet\nOn over in his one which doesn't respond or with the frequency we large um so\nWhat we're involved here are the men are from Missouri reports\nNot only are persons deserve successful Berbers would have Persians to receive combinations of do work for ... figure out what's missing remember him in a rational word a prefers that are missing and ... [noise]\nUm you know moving forward move for were much more for the room were were were dramatic future suburbs are over as we're we're we're ready to root for\nNo Lizzie Lizzie did I hear you correctly when you say that you've been searching for a clinical trial to participate in but you can't find one on one that you call that will you qualify for\nUm yeah that's correct I found one but I don't think they're saying it's a vaccine but it's like\n... which I think that's different from you know therapy but it's also one where there's a fifty percent chance that I'll get a CBO uh-huh rat out with a vaccine same thing as them you know therapy is that different\nOkay unit for ... ... ... different germs or mental served yeah\nMartha Stewart and usually I mean what what what would you would guidance or advice would you ... have really because I imagine that there are many other people like her out there who would like to have access to these treatments even in the clinical trial phase but for whatever reason cannot well you\nKnow you have two questions you know ... to issues first Lizzie thank you so much for calling in and for sharing your story with us because um this is something that absolutely needs to be raised every time we have a discussion about some great breakthrough\nThere's just always so much more to do and I hope very much that you are in an environment where you have expert doctors who are doing everything they can for you because um\nYou know there's there's a lot that can be done but there's still a lot more to do now the issue of clinical trials again with the thank you for illustrating that how the importance of that\nI'm One of the things that one of the big problems we have\nOnly three percent of patients adult patients in the United states participate in clinical trials\nTo Ninety seven percent of people out there\nWe don't have information or even access to them for some of these new um potential breakthrough therapy so one of the big a part of the things that we need to advocate for is more availability of clinical trials and those trials need to get every tiny community not just the big cities for people who have insurance yeah\nWe'll Lizzie thank you very much for your call and we we hope hoping and wish you all the best uh as you continue to uh to to live with your cancer so thank you so much for your call

O. P. N.

he's written about why his new book is called the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we have an excerpt of it at one point radio dot org\nAnd you can call and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk or if you're a Republican and you happen to agree with Max Boot about you're concerned about where the GOP is headed what do you think we ought to do to address those concerns\nBut if you're a Republican who thinks the party is exactly where it needs to be right now representing your interest in doing so with a full throated passion call us as well what's your thought for ... where one eight hundred forty three to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk\nUh now I'm actually in the in the last segment you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly what do you mean by that\nAll the people who who basically flat or his ego including people like Lindsey Graham who once called him a cook and now\nAll talks about how Donald Trump as a superb Gulf or I mean I I I have to our chapter and verse in my book of of of the circumstance of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if he were the second coming who think that he used the savior of humanity I mean that's unbelievable this was a\nPresident or you know who was only has the support all about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed himself into a Donald Trump called I mean so many people have jumped the Kool Aid including people but I once\nAnd in soul crushing experience from you see what's going on\nWell uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI I think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly\nBut for many of the others um they did heap praise or upon a President Trump now the whole sort of a person by person\nMoment took about eleven minutes and we're not going to play all of that obviously we've significantly cut it down but here's some of the the flattery that members of the cabinet where heaping upon the president in June two thousand Seventeen\nI think he was president of the\n... or what an incredible honor is to leave that fire health and Human Services that this pivotal time under your leadership I Can't thank you enough for the religious given shift is you show\nI Want to thank you for free\n[noise]\nHire staff around him Mr President we face for the last ... years\nMr President radar traveling around the country for the last year an even greater uh her to be here serving in your ...\nSo you heard their vice president Mike Pence then secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price transportation secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve minutiae and\nAh now Max Boot you know many of these people can you explain a they're they're ... seemingly unquestioning unquestioning feel teach to the president\nIt's it's really a cult and what the un I think that they feel it's necessary because they understand\nUh that that Donald Trump doesn't egomaniac who is also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's his cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on but you know that that tape but you played some is to my mind\nIs one of the most revolting an on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this is not what should be happening\nIn the White House the people's houses in our constitutional republic where we do not elect Donald Trump as king you're supposed to be the president charged with enforcing the laws and yet he is being treated\nBy those around him as if he were the leader of a religious cult was profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this still Max Boot is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity and this party is around the president of the United states\nWell forgive me maybe I'm naive\nBut I Do think that politicians have a higher duty to the country into the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans but I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham an on and on and on\nWho have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in\n... in public when I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president and why won't they do that because they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the\nThe Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against them he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people but worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better Toulouse reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their\nBut let me see I'm trying to figure out the right way to ask it but it but can't the argument would be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles or what got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your boost for support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho ... who cast their vote for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of a of international elitism gone or wry that that was that was money and effort that should have been spent right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nA a a principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War and two thousand three very those same people surrounding themselves or or their surrounding the president right now so what is it not inevitable in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including\nThe mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an island that discredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy\nAnd I I ride in the book and in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and soul searching way about my own responsibility for getting here I was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with Seventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than than most of that Seventy two percent\nAnd for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounced my decision and now with\nThe clarity of hindsight and looking back in and trying to figure out my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a clean brush the in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nAnd I was wrong to have advocated the war this is a terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I\nAnd I think the other you know supporters and architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's of course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though he won't admit it now but but there's no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way\nA an open the way to ... which you know I think is is a catastrophe for America in the world far worse than what we've seen in the fast because he is\nA you know undermining our democracy with those attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad he's undermining American allies he's opening the way for dictators so you know this was a terrible situation but you know we have to be honest and and and admit\nThat the Republican establishment was not blameless in getting us here\nYeah well we're speaking with max ... is our his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk a max it's got a couple of callers here if we can let's first go to Mike who's calling from winter veal North Carolina Mike you're on the air\nMax yes\nI agree with your analysis completely I think Trump an absolutely horrible president I was telling all my friends I could vote against him in the primaries\nBut leaving a party and had a terrible mistake we need to fight for our party and hope that someone like I have a mental block on flakes name or ... or some decent Republican comes in and challenges still president twenty twenty\nTo fight against him leaving the party is is just wrong\nThey make before I turn it back to Mexico let me ask you mean you mentioned Jeff Flake or I'd say get Jeff Flake Bob Corker all these are Republicans who who are choosing to retire rather than to continue their political career and I don't hear any of them seemed to going to run for president so it seems like there's there's no room for them at all in the party\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from college fine where

excuse me Stephen you're on the air\n[noise] I'm not going to max thanks for taking my call so I'm a I'm a moderate Democrat probably closer to independent and my concern is that I recognize that there's value in bowl conservatism of protecting individual rights\nAt the same time trying to come together society girl society and my biggest concern is that you see the fringes that are just pushing further further right and left\nTo ... protect the gravy and protect the lazy or respectively so you know it seems like gosh I'm getting holding these two directions and uh you know ... ...\nTowards the greedy and his minions and it just it is incredibly frustrating for people like me in the middle that uh you know can't find a way so just wondering if you could comment on that\nSteven thanks for your call next to go ahead\nWell I feel Stevens paying [laughter] I mean I feel exactly the same way I I'm politically homeless I I Can't be part of this Trump provide Republican Party but I don't feel comfortable being part of the Bernie Sanders\nElizabeth Warren party either and so on you know I'm I'm stranded in the middle I think you know look I think Democrats have an opportunity here because I think there are a lot of disaffected voters who could not be part of what Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I I'm In that category if Democrats I think\nGo to the center there can be a historic realignment of American politics of the kind that you saw in the Nineteen thirties I Would make the Democrats the majority party for fifty years to come I think the way they do that is by nominating somebody who was pretty centrist in twenty twenty and not going to to the progressive extreme\nWell the all the forces that we've seen in terms of the primary process in terms of campaign finance the things that are being league or the Republican Party some of the things that believes Republican Party also the leader the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think they are in the in the twenty twenty cycle that the Democrats might actually\nNominate a centrist versus someone who's on the more progressive wing\nWell I think anything is possible I mean who would have imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump or twenty sixteen so we don't know who the Republican not who the Democratic nominee is going to being twenty twenty but there is no question that almost all of the\nMajor contenders the people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees are certainly from the progressive wing of the party and that concerns me as as somebody who's who's more of a of a centrist center right for a person\nYeah let's go to Jim who's calling from St Petersburg Florida Jill you're on the air\nAll right thank you and I guess my my question has to do with the fact that a Christian I talked to a lot of my friends out and let me see strange politics most of my Christian friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say that the Republican\nOut whereas um most of my other friends might be other denominations are some type of Democrat or when I find that people that aren't really get a Republican\nBut they'd be gay or minority whatnot it usually has to do with the money that they want you to be able to preserve their money for their future so my question is it as a liberal Democrat Chris\nI thought is that for the good of the world where it's supposed to take care of each other and the point of our government is to make sure that everybody get by and everybody has the ability to do their happiness\nI my question what was the original point up having a conservative wing of the party back when you join and get it a lot of the religious right in any way sway your decision to at the end of the\nJoke yeah just thanks for your call go ahead max\nThe religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties uh and it's dismaying to me to see what happened with with with with that one of the party that you have ... I mean I agree with a lot of them in in the late Nineteen nineties when they were cast the getting Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these arch Moore listens colds who are criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions that you know this was a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off\nA playboy playmate and a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a president who has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of of of uh\nCalled the death of outrage where he was lamenting the fact that more people were not outraged\nAbout Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrage is actually a pretty good description of the ah of the of the Christian right a today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say about the shocking immorality of the president that they support\n[noise] ... I Want to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's this question with this issue of race or and and how that is shaped as are actually in the Republican Party is going in because I'm I I'm thinking of\nUm you know the number of times you pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people looked upon and said that that was racist but\nDid you ... around him you know thinking of house Speaker Paul Ryan ... going so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks but ... but nevertheless I'm going to still support the part of the United states because he's ... he's helping other deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important\nTo a lot of people so far as long as that you know your your term ... bargain exist what hope do you have\nA for change if the if the change has to come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated in devastating defeats\nThey have to know there'll be a political price to pay for trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political game there is nothing I've seen in American political life in my lifetime that as more despicable them is they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he's for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his racist package when he you know undocumented immigrants this is a disgrace and the Republican Party is disgusting itself by going along with us\nWell let's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Ira

situation it can be no doubt any man woman and said already face down from a call now from what he is a true it's total dictator and another Hitler however I'd like to tell you\nThere's no need to be

just a moment but when you when you said that you see the president as another Hitler\nIsn't the very fact that that is the the tenor of political conversation in America right now isn't that part of the problem because what you yourself said with all due respect Ira is also incredibly extreme in any it makes it hard to have any kind of a a you know civil coming together in this country\nNo future

I Would I Want to just inject a little bit of not skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong because I remember\nAwhile ago maybe a generation ago there was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman researching angiogenesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of any and all cancers in the body very exciting line of research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement ...\nMagnet you couldn't have possibly picked a better example um you know we didn't plan on this but um you know one of the things I'm sure Dr Alison can will chime in here too is that\nThat work that Dr Folkman did to look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Alison group has developed with ... with came out of his work\nAnd the combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that it with activating the taking the breaks off the T cell is producing even better responses in some tumors so at that nothing goes wasted so\nThat's that's correct in the run of the things that were ...\n... or is this drawing from ... um\nThere's just a matter of therapy can be combined refer about all the other mental service but was congressional ... introduce was therapies are virtually anything rituals tumor cells can be used prime an immune response or or ... so many Tom emotions are so many\n... we've we've got a really\n...

physiology Jim Alison he shared the award with to sue hundreds of Kyoto University\nGym Alison as chair of the department of immunology at Mt Anderson Cancer center were also joined by Monica Brittany ... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology\nAnd a little earlier in the show Dr Britain you'll you told us that we've never seen an explosion in the terms of the number of possible treatments or therapies for cancer as we are seeing right now some two thousand\nDifferent treatments in the pipeline the researcher clinical trial pipeline and it's a very exciting moment in cancer research but Dr Bert nearly just before the break we were also talking about how how individualized these therapies can be so are we talking about you know slightly different therapies tailored\nFor from person to person oh perhaps\nThe whole um emphasis right now on understanding the individual biology of every patient and being able to target that specifically\nUm that not only helps us develop treatments that work better it helps us develop treatments that have fewer side effects you know many examples of this and it's a general direction I Believe we're heading and all of oncology I see\n[laughter] ... yeah in fact just to add a like a burden earlier was talking about the adage institutions recognize we know now that many of those are generated by a ... that are part of the cost to join the process itself\nAnd so there's a big effort on I'm involved in summer but there's many many groups\nTrying to develop rapid was of genome sequencing is that gets faster and cheaper to ... make them should be clear and then you have the patience along with with\nA checkpoint blockers or you know therapy perhaps would be much much lower doses of focus the response even more tightly I'm On the cancer cells themselves\nWell Jim Nelson and Monica ... nearly um we've got a comment here this come in on our website and that the person wants us to to make a point that I I wanted to ask you about\nSome of them coming calling themselves planes dealers that I Hope that in addition to the brilliant scientists involved the show addresses the practical impact in other words the prices of these therapies\nA means to suggest limited to start with you I mean I'm seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars as a cause for some of these therapies that is that right\n[noise] yes yes that's correct and it's a it's it's a\nIt's too it's too hot it really is I mean I can understand some of them because in the in development um Bloomberg for example that changed all the rules the standard um\nAnd points to choose critically for evaluating drugs that target dresser sales were useful anymore to a lot of failed trials because they use the wrong and points and just researchers are developmental costs were amazing rabbis will probably the most expensive ever I'm not sure [noise]\nBut still that's no that's no reason to keep those prices for an hour because they certainly don't reflect the cost of making the drug itself so they got to come down particularly as we go to the combinations and my\nHeart you know for me and others outside my area but I got a hopes to become down fast so that they can get some more Persians\nYeah Monica Britain usually I I mean I Know that neither you a gym or setting prices for drugs that are are that are coming out of clinical trial I Want to acknowledge that ah and also we've heard frequently over the many years in a gym just pointed to it that the development costs are these drugs are very high because sometimes it we're talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean both of you are in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because the costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots it when it comes to availability and access to to health care in the United states\nThat went in there now ... you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and you know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs\nIt's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus what we can do as doctors and as researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients in the best most\nNot so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more is when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and has not and really as as clinicians and researchers that's where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to ... who's calling from Jupiter, Florida Lizzie you're on the air\nHello Hi Lucy go ahead Oh hi thank you for taking my call 'em\nI wanted to counter all this talk of excitement\nWith my experience of frustration over you know therapy I'm fifty two years old I was diagnosed with advanced stage three ovarian cancer which statistically has a terrible survival rate I'm like I'll be very very very lucky if I'm Still alive and five years\nAnd yet every day on NPR I hear about these clinics with all of a sudden you know therapy but there's not for me and so my question to your research or its is for someone like me how many years I have to try to stay alive you can conventional methods of treatment until someone comes up with an air either it's going to pro on my life [laughter] you know ...\nHang on don't don't hang up the phone here let me just turn to Jim Allison first a ...\nFor her you know what I mean when we were one of the roof shot but about immunotherapy is because there's a lot of transfers the word uniform was fertile before are better now responding unfortunate but all respond them in ... group ... really are motor responded much of a ... year\nOn over in his one which doesn't respond for the frequency re large um so\nWhat were her role during here are the men are from Missouri reports ... oh what goes wrong not only are persons deserve successful burgers with the person receiving combinations of don't work control to figure out what's missing\nRemember him in an irrational way or the friends that are missing or ...\nYou know move it forward ... ... more for it to you know we're we're done most of the future of numbers so over one we're we're just move root for\n... was he did I hear you correctly when you say that you've been searching for a clinical trial to participate in but you can't find one or one that you call it that will that you qualify for\nUm yeah that's correct I found one but I don't think they're saying it's a vaccine but it's like\n... which I think it's different from you know therapy but it's also one where there's a fifty percent chance that I'll get a CBO uh-huh [noise] read I was a vaccine same thing as them you know therapy is that different\nOkay dumped truck truck different germs administer yeah money's weren't nearly I mean what would what would you would guidance or advice would you ... have really because I imagine that there are many other people like her out there who would like to have access to these treatments even in the clinical trial phase but for whatever reason cannot\nYou know you have two questions you know ... to issues first Lizzie thank you so much for calling in and for sharing your story with us because um this is something that absolutely needs to be raised every time we have a discussion about some great breakthrough\nThere's just always so much more to do and I hope very much that you are in an environment where you have expert doctors who are doing everything they can for you because um\nYou know there's there's a lot that can be done but there's still a lot more to do now the issue of clinical trials again with the thank you for illustrating that how the importance of that\nI'm One of the things that one of the big problems we have\nOnly three percent of patients adult patients in the United states participating political trials\nFor Ninety seven percent of people out there\nFor some of these new um potential breakthrough therapy so one of the big a part things that we need to advocate for is more availability of clinical trials and those trials need to get to every tiny community not just the big cities for people who have insurance yeah\nWe'll Lizzie thank you very much for your call and we we hope hoping and wish you all
