you if you've got a couple of friends there in the studio that was a little unexpected to me because we didn't know a ... you'd have anyone else with you on your end in London but you know what even sparked me about\nA this is talk about the survivors mindset and getting outside your comfort zone is ever going to get outside of our little radio comfort zone for a minute good he would if we can you reintroduce us to you too who your friends are and he said they have an incredible survival story well\nWhat I was saying it's a survival is this is so much about the spirit you know and the rest of it as the arena that we ended up playing and whether you're stuck in a life raft or whether you're in a plane crash or whether you're dealing with bereavement illness or whatever ... having not survive the spirit\nAnd you know a a it's a it's great I Love being yeah love to hear about this I'm excited to to get questions from your list is but I always try and kind of\nBringing inspirational people as well in a band that Simon to\nA couple that I've met they reach out to me that you'll hear that story in a minute but I really wanted to meet them and say hey come and join me fussing few because this is a fun one and I will take some questions and all of that but what they know about is is togetherness and an holding on uh-huh okay though and Ben is aged\n... eleven hello then Simon is is that\nSome ... ... a little bit about your story well hey man I'm Sorry for the first of all since I don't know who you are on our listeners don't know can you just introduce yourself a little more fully what what's your full name and where where are you from\nI'm I'm Benjamin almost a uh I'm from ... in England down\nAnd and your lesson okay and your dad is Simon sitting next to you there in London yeah that's correct yes hello Simon what it wants your full name also from Cheshire I presume I yes Simon ... okay well the great to have you with surprise guests on this show so so tell us a little bit about what bears talking about what's your your survival story\nI'm telling you he's a bit nervous or the wind or as all in an unexpected bent bend house quite by ...\nHe he can be ... hospitalized for about four days at a time I'm being unable to breathe I'm so he's on regular ... medication for that but he he wants\nHe's he's tried boxing but most recently um best program on this new book especially has inspired him to go out and about ... so he looks going climbing into mountain since he's always pushing himself\nA ... every time we go um he he uses an inhaler ... he's really talking back on using the inhaler now so he's really pushing himself getting higher up in the mountains but unless early on\nYou know using the inhaler last see he's he's really pushing him so she knew Spanish\nYeah well that sounds great and and and the band let me just turn back to you really quickly so uh what is what is it about about bear and what he's done and his book that inspires you to to push yourself why why do you want to do that um it\n... them all the things in that light cannot will still for everything ... thinking shift inspirational\nOkay well so let's see how far the inspiration goes 'cause I Want to play a clip here from two thousand seven this is from an episode of bear grills man versus wild and he was dropped into the rugged terrain of Western Australia and he ran out of water and here's what happened next\nThing I kind of getting my eye and pay and this is\nSomething I've never done before and I'm expecting it to be pretty horrible but I Need to keep going and [noise] it may seem disgusting but you're you're in it's safe to drink [noise]\nFair\nGrills or re high grading in Western Australia in two thousand seven uh then I'm going to you and I forget that [laughter] I'm going to let you have to have your\nFirst time I go entirely that bad and you're lucky what do you drink you know you're lucky if you know [laughter] how about a novel with an apple juice stand\nWould you go so far as to drink you're in if you had to stuck on a mountain [laughter]\nDeep fans [laughter] probably yeah [laughter] right well Ben Simon thank you for big surprise guest this hour or ... very girls let me let me turn back to you or was it disgusting it sounds like it was\nA ... a lot of things and survival of disgusting you know but ... you're going to lead the prejudices behind you go to do whatever it takes and survival food is never going to Tyson ice will look nice and survival\nFluids Seventy Tice nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and I'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pie for father's funeral there if you will always out there and actually I've met a few of them over the years and that kind of make a swift exit if we're going to buy somebody tells me they do it for fun I\nYou know what I'm hoping in your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty eight here you actually have this really great a diagram\nOf below ground solar still\nThat if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia being dig a hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic he put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it\nAnd the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole will actually condense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cup\nAnd you say you stay here if you you're in eight in the whole before setting up the still moist junior year and will condense into clean drinking water why didn't you knew that\nThat you get the thing is if you're really the hydrated drinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you just into pure waste product so if you can make a cell is still like this you have the you have the the resources to do that paying into the bit around that you're gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're going to get fluids out of that\nFind yourself stranded in survival situation for example you call breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrated you don't want to be paying out those fluids because actually if you pay as clear\nThat that can actually help ... so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways may be paying onto your clothes and wrapped around her head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know and he he's a little things about the bunch of times I mean it was right if you love looking back into it because well it's always the crew the guy that you think the next few days we'll move ... wrapped around my neck you know on the head scarf the pay and you know but he said let's see if it's about what ever tell you who's in it\nSince you mentioned your crew I've always wondered I mean how ... your crew was there with you with their equipment having to go through the same terrain and as you are I mean how how how much do you ask of them in terms of uh of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing\nI'll tell you while they are they're incredible they really are there'd be with me from day one is a small team\nYou know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thing can hype about them is true you know they always say hey ... you have the easy job we're going to do everything you do but backwoods carrying a camera you know and it's a bit you know\nBe under no illusion they are incredible and they work the hardest and the the real unsung heroes and the whole story\nAll right well we're speaking with bare grills he is host of running wild with their grills and of course man versus wild he's got a new book out called how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation ah we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred fourteenth street talk and call us with your questions for bear and\nWe've actually got a bunch of them already so let's go to

he's got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation a bear before the break we heard from college Steve who was former a navy special forces are here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous SERE training and he was talking about how\nUm as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've\nEver experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now yeah\nNo festivals the respect feel service and a lot watched the ... the\nGuy who rang him before us your by so right there that the battle for survival is one and lost in the mind I'm just see a training is something I went through likewise with part of the British special fool says ah it is long it is oh you should it's tough\nAnd the time on the ride I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that might cause a\nWe're into this you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks and I she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy this as a lone survivor to look up to yourself and again you know when we're now is the crew you know women filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of has to be needed you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed just to put a first on that well you do you know the ...\nThe everything on the right to send my child that but it's all so busy you know I just remember that the training I went through to the days on All right it was just due to ... and if you collected firewood repairing the setting snap as doing that and I always love\nAnd by the end it's like yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beef you got to keep thinking like you know I always say to people in survival situation is never letting your mind go into neutral is always something to be doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes right\n... and then when you go one other buddy with you\nThere is one of the thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from your cars and actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was\nThinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly may ... spending three hours trying to lie to five ... and the reality of a sudden in the old days on the bus while shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing this so you know hours and hours studying ... obviously that she was going to make a Rudy boring program you know I guess edited down and ... you know it's a bit of music and ... book bags go to a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said right at the start of the show survivor of summed up three was never give up or what about that to nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the\nRules who he's got to the do get that determine you know nest Saturday the the Berlin the brave the strongest\nWell so let's do a lightning round a quick quick\nRight here for ... by the way to rabbits for\nA few people [laughter] that's got to be no one day he loves food team found like wow yeah I I'm not seeing that Seventy says we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave with nothing no camera crews running and they have to fill my upbringing themselves that\nYou know we come back a month later and it's like ... showing that they like stream weight loss it and that is the reality of survival is yeah you're starving you ... your frighten you wet your cold and ... and\nYou know and that's why it's it's it's very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell speaking of the the glamorous part of survival and do we just got so many good questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked the question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans and survival situation it's vital situations how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why could not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind tests attract needs needs some attention yeah I've I mean there's definitely took you about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff and I saw\nUm but on the whole is you're not getting the land ... by the failures than you next time I go to ... to ... that one again\nRight so I get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous planter animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super ... make big mistakes once and when it comes to you know poison things I've funky mushrooms and ... you got to really know your stuff and ... if the doubt there's no doubt don't need to write you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then you know I mean look at that story from Alaska was that one side great film you know the other end of the wiring the Alaska decided in the United yet I\nYeah by the way if you have it from folks have already Jon Krakauer original book is amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\n[noise] well hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress and there are things you can snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit and all the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples that survival is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity\nUm and actually some of them they have the guns the guy with the you know [laughter] or that if it was impressive to see as well\nAll right one more a lightning round here question Sam Winston on Twitter or say on our website says beer can you do your classic Hal like when you accomplish a big Clyde thanks that's from Sam ...\nSome odd never give out team were on

I Can't find the information to know what that is true or not\nThat is true that the the pine tree is one of the unsung heroes of the wild and there's so much you can do everything you mentioned but

U. T. we've got links to her latest stories on the Texas Senate race at one point radio dot org Ashley Lopez welcome to the pros\nFirst of all like whoa whoa through some of the basics here for people who aren't as familiar with the Texas Senate races obsessive politics watchers might be I mean how close is the race right now between a Senator Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke\nIf you ask some experts they say it's a toss up pretty much um all the polls have had cruise with a slight edge but you know as the election of gotten closer\nUm the polls have got the two candidates closer which is surprising a lot of people because as you mentioned this is not a swing state so a Sweeney election especially from mid term is it's ... it's just really surprising in Texas so a toss up and has it been like that consistently\nFor the past couple of months or is is narrowing were or widening\nWell in the beginning it seemed like this was you know\nGet not going to be a ... a race at all I mean when federal workforce and now the the congressman by the way in El Paso when he first announced everyone's like you know this is a really interesting candidate a lot of people like him he's you know really interested in working\nWith the you know the Republicans in Congress he's well known for being friends with will Hurd was a Republican in Congress so that was kind of a thing as she was\nA really bipartisan friendly guy um but you know they didn't think that a ton of money would flood flood into Texas for this race so you know it was going to seem like a long shot for better work but um it's only in the past couple of months that it seems like this race is getting closer than anyone expected okay and so\nThen what's what's the cause of the traction it seems that Beto O'Rourke a is is is gaining here in Texas\nFive degrees in Newport sixty seven in westerly listens Rhode Island public radio\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering colder guards for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home by prescription only information at Colo guard test\nDot com and Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are SUVs and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance on Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making the chalk her body we're talking about the race for Senate in Texas and that's the race between incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz\nAnd congressman Beto O'Rourke it's a close race which is surprising a lot of people and it's why it's one of the reasons why it's maybe one of the most watched Senate races in the country right now ahead of the midterms\nAnd we're joined today by Ashley Lopez she's a senior reporter for K. U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas Brandon running house joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston joining us\nFrom Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel I feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between\nCrews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOr what does the Texas race mean to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nActually Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth and the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between ah since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc that are ... not monolithic\nAs brand and was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and Latinos are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who say that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group\nA Latino voters is that\nThey haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore it costs a lot of money in Texas\nAnd progressive groups and third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see\nA good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party I'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work\nThan has yet to be done I see\nBrand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval\nSome thirty nine percent yeah\nThey're they're low overall um\nRecent polling has gotten more and about fifty percent um but that's really popped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nTed Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of\nMore continuous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump but there's a lot of friction so\nI see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here is potentially influential in this race I mean white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election naturally gonna what's probably drive any kind of success that Iraq fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challenges the congressional level many of whom have\nA really harness this vote and could potentially do well but I also think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks ... considerably in favor of better or work they don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for\nPeople who are over forty but it is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual growth of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being of our luck poor partner\nPlaces like Ford been county here outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another level of success the Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in in this race in November well it's always the wild card and\nElections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always sad vagaries and that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it because it's a non voting stay so if you get all these populations who don't usually vote that could change what Texas looks like if you changed the electorate you can change who gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term\nI mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and\nAnd angry and you know all that they typically like Democrats aren't likely to vote during the term so if if that's a different this year like this could look different than most Mitt terms now so I'm seeing for example\n... I'm a a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever shown up and listen to you talking to to to voters or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so is he hoping\nTo dry out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the tactics that we've seen in other places we saw that in New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nHe's betting on yeah go ahead written in ...\nOh sorry I was going to say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout is in ... in mid term years you're talking about\nProbably on the order of about forty percent which is extremely low now I think we'll have a turnout probably spike a little bit in this election because you definitely have the energy that we've\nSeen 'em and so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you still have about two and a half million unregistered Texans who could otherwise register\nThe Latino population is only registered to vote at about forty forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there's\nIt's really difficult for Democrats to win statewide okay well I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should know that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and to Congress and better routes campaign as well invited them or or one of the represent their representatives to join us today\nUh aerobics campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our class but we do our due diligence on that part but let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his\nContentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president on substance and we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax cut of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations we're seeing record low unemployment\nTexans lives are better so yeah I could have chosen\nTo make it about myself to be selfish and say you know what my feelings are hurt so I'm going to take my marbles and go home but I think that would have been not doing the job I was elected to\nThat Senator Ted Cruz on September twenty second let's take a call here Dan is calling from San Antonio you're on the air Dan\nHi uh thanks for taking my call 'em I Want to say that\nWell there's a lot of work and I know don't have all that much time but I did want to say that that or gives me and my family's in ... that we haven't felt love generation or my parents would say like John F. Kennedy or the Kennedy family inspiring us to to have some hope\nBecause living in this so called red state lakes us cringe every time I hear that because we were starch blue family and everyone I Know just about is\nOr at least inside their county here in San Antonio or however we are very diverse state and it's all good and like the message that list for years about\nHope and moving forward whether you're a Republican Democrat independent because we're so sick of the bigotry and hateful comes from Mr Trump in DC and that's not what we're here in San Antonio in Texas and probably most of America people are just a negative message\n[noise] support for on point comes from Carver night offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses including automatic back up for

we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez Brandon rotting house and Abby Livingston\nAs well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to end and watching on their televisions\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first at\nThe only way for me to be able to\nDallas last\nName George Wallace actually Bryan, Texas where more\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto O'Rourke campaign and here's some sound from an ad that were the Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running\nThey can you give them\n\nAn ad there from Senator Ted Cruz brand of rotting house that that Ted Cruz add ... ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership but the idea that\nUm uh that you may be liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah I thought you're going to say that this was something that holds the Texans hold dear because it's like country music but I think that's true as well\nThere's definitely a a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign understands how to run in taxes they know that there's a certain like guys as you say for\nVoting um to keep you know people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely a enough Republican support\nYou in a midterm election that an organic\nKind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work or work\nHas to tangibly make up about a million votes and the just assure as God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in mid term so the difficulty of trying to make up that with a campaign like Cruz's running which primes Republicans and primes conservatives it just makes it really difficult well\nLet's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air\nI made millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I had voted for Donald Trump\nAnd um I grew up in a conservative household and my husband is conservative my whole family is but I've been very encouraged and I and voting for that to work that election in November just because he's looking beyond party can line and I think that's so important\nTo 'em in this day and age right like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that don't work is going out there and I'm making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing\nChristine touched a few quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year\nYes I did oh so what's changed other hand\nIn that um I really ... whenever he was in the twenty sixth the election\nAnd how just doesn't like the talk that whenever he was talking to\n'em President Trump and just how like how he stood against them and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that\nYou're a true um I think it's important that person's true colors and how he just\nWas really a good President Trump and all of a sudden he for him like yeah that's that's not to show you something about so many personality now I really appreciate how ... our work is just um he is who he is\nOf course you can ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you're talking about you you like the fact that you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the campaign recently right to a controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or\nReview for a Broadway musical of where he is in the review he wrote some um unkind things about the female actresses in Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seemed to be their phenomenally large body parts or need to say it does that concern you\n[noise] um I I don't know um [noise] I Know he's apologized\nFor it ... and um [noise] I I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for the ... but to still standing up for women's rights\nYeah ... I I just wanted to I don't know it was a perfectly finance a rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so so thank you so much for your call\nAbby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked to the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more positive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things from ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In Texas that's just sort of a an ... I Would call these women a husband should stand up for his wife and so it's it's it's\nCorn and we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave\n'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came a from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military in Oregon ... ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful um and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated friendly with people like me and those are the decisions of public trust and power who have been unable to resolve this brings justice for what has been drawing and just all during dressed up in this country and violently peacefully\nWhile they argue this country are watching these games they take on me to bring attention to this problem to ensure that we fix that is why they're doing it and I can think of nothing more Americans\n\nAshley Lopez or as I mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas\nWell I mean if you look at the black vote in Texas I Would say it went over really well specifically among black voters yeah something like Ninety seven percent approval according to like one latest pulling that one might be a little high but it it's not unlike most polls that have come out\nUm you know conservatives just as red meat for them this is something that Ted Cruz had been talking about um the NFL or than that the protest during the national anthem he's been talking about his rallies\nBecause it really frustrates conservative and they see this as disrespectful to the flag into veteran so you know if you look at like democratic base voters this is something that they are so excited to hear you know a Democrat\nI'm standing up for racial injustice in their eyes and then on the on the other side you know conservative voters you know this is a polarizing issue so conservative or to see this very differently and are very frustrated by this\nYeah Brenda running house I mean I think ... outside of Texas political watchers are saying\nThat perhaps this is the way ... talks about these issues uh is one of the reasons why he's getting so much traction there that it's not\n... dot com they're just down the street from wrist Egypt reporting on south coast communities sort of measure to vote Rhode Island public radio and ... journalism alliance\nAnd also support from look Gordon School\nCommitted to a progressive academic program to empower young learners to advocate confidently for themselves and others have an open house coming up on November third more at Gordon School dot org\nThis is Rhode Island public radio eighty nine point three ... you wouldn't be a new force\nFor also heard on one or two points\nOf an F ... un P.

Stanford joins us as well she's in obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us\nIn our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of ... you gave us the the top three bullet points of the\nUh aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand so let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what are you in [noise]\nAh well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago my call this is how I I was like we hung out together yeah I Know it was really fun ask 'em\nAnd I think I mean as but even though there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic Lee healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage of fat people with about healthy obesity and some studies find a much larger percentage\nAnd I actually you know Fifteen or feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter\nIs to lose and we know how harmful it is the shame people for their weight\nAnd so if there are big health effects of obesity I'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important you know I mean I I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man\nTheir health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine from my doctor to talk to me about those things\nBut he needs to talk to me about those things in a\nHealthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices what are your drug use practices and not in this way that hello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that I mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino was the way that you guys had an\nHour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them\nAnd that's something that with primary care providers a lot of fat patients never gets that luxury of somebody asking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them\nWell a lot of patients period will never get that luxury with their primary care physicians doctors never go ahead yeah so am I Want to touch on a few points\nNumber one um I Want to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I can tell you that patients on the extremes meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity\nI'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has either mild moderate to severe obesity\nI'm so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes week vice and stigma so I Want us to to make sure that we don't do that\nNow this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity\nIs such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define clearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology\nWhat we're finding is that this term metabolic ... healthy obesity is is a little bit falling out of favor because we're we're finding is that even in patients where things appear normal on the surface\nThey do have issues so for example\nI have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients that obviously have moderate to severe obesity um and when you look at them they may have no obesity ... more but conditions at the time of surgery\nWhat we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and what's that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease\nNow if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound that their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have liver disease but when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence\nThat we're sending to surgery actually have fatty liver disease Ninety five percent or Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this so that shows you that we're not picking up on something\nA way that we might in an adult patients who question about this because I think you know there is something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing out like\nBut but why should a neurologist though be talking to someone about their weight when that person's there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said Dr Stanford because how\nAnd they're all just isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway but let's look at what you guys just said and this is going to put all my medical ... because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity\nHave a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs that are ... that are used to treat migraine headaches also are great for weight loss\nSo when I find that my patients and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients\nThe I can currently be treating with the medication both disease process is I'm getting rid of\nTheir migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation solve it said that their neurologist approaching them\nMaybe from the lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all organ systems soon ... is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that\n[noise] well I think I mean the story that I'm hearing\nFrom fat people are not that they're neurologists are saying you know we have a couple of ... do you mind if we run some tests the stories that I'm hearing are we won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing from people that their doctors refused to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors are used to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight\nI think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate\nWeight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor\nAnd I think that it's it's really worthwhile to separate those two things because not every fat person goes to the doctor seeking to lose weight a lot of them feel like their life is fine if you like their habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already on a plan by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight and some other way\nAll they needed a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get an a train accident\nThey need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix that ... D located shoulder\nAnd so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that fat people are not getting\nEffective medical care and a lot of fat people just shows up in studies to that fat people avoid going to the doctor because they're afraid that they're going to get shame for their weight if they don't get cancer screenings because they're afraid of what the interaction with the nurse is going to be like they don't want to be weighed and I think if you're thinking about effective care\nI think it's fine for a neurologist to bring up hey you know based on the research we have a couple of things that are related weight might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not the kinds of interactions that people are having\nIt's really important to think about how pervasive weight stigma is and how weight does this credit patience with their doctors often times in specialties\nThat are really only had him ... related to weight Dutch\nNever go ahead yeah so I Do agree that we as physicians overall don't do a great job of approaching patients that struggle with their weight secondary to our own biases\nAnd an adequate education surrounding how to treat patients that have obesity and what we do know and you do cover this in your article is that um education surrounding obesity nutrition physical activity and medical schools residency programs throughout the country is minimal at best\nI can tell you that there are several organizations working on improving the standards um surrounding this issue because we do know that forty percent of the adult population has obesity and Nineteen percent of the pediatric patients ... bc which means that this is by far the most prevalent chronic disease and so I agree that we do have some work\nUm I Would say that patients are concerned about the cure they're getting and if they want and dedicated care\nI Would seek out I'm a fellowship trained to be the medicine physician like myself or one that has undergone I'm training and certification by the American board of obesity medicine and I just jump in here for a second yeah because if you're living in Boston or Seattle or Chicago or Houston maybe you can find that\n... what if what if you're living in a rural county that doesn't have that kind of ... that we're doing a really good job so the American board of obesity medicine has certified twelve hundred physicians and obesity and different sub specialties\nFrom neurology to OBGYN to pass all gee in recent years and what you can do is you can go to the American board of obesity medicine site\nType in your ZIP Code and see what your doctors are certified and I'm In that area there is no pay wall to get through you can see who is working in the space and\nIt eighty nine six three seven four seven seven the website is R.

I'm Sorry Michel hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr Stephanie solved\nFrom them ... was interviewed and we do have all of our patients and spend time with the psychologist delving to issues such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life\nSo I Do think that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like Dr solved working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops to do a good job by bringing those voices into the artist so I Want to switch you can\nGears here for a second I'm In and take a step back and Michael bring you in back in here for this as well\nBecause I'm Dr Stanford I just I heard you a couple of times in this conversation you know call ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight but\nFifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese\nNow so I mean I don't I don't think anyone's gonna say that the this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and ... and so so this is such a layperson question but I just want to get your field for ... and ... and Michael you too [noise]\nIs it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it kind of happened overnight\nAbsolutely I think this is I'm really we are in an OB so Jenike environment so I call it the perfect storm what we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality and duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances what I mean by that\nIs that we are rewarded with being able to talk to our colleagues in Russia\nAnd talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states to tell\nYou that maternity is terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that not not joking me right if you're talking about sleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who are in lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive than the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega\n[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more\nThat assumes that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids\nAnd two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen in process and whatever else and that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have\nWe we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and\nThe choices that we make with in those options\nI don't think this blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them to do\nAnd so the reason why I wanted to bring this up Dr Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and\nEven in that context in this conversation it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know a ... individual responsibility or things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to weigh outside of that right well we\nHave to go outside the box we need to bring together a person's and healthcare persons and that our policy makers\nUm physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a in a direction where we actually\nHave any data on obesity rates in both the pediatric an adult population and and I think what we've done um with regards to this epidemic his work\nEntirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and\nOh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world well let's get another call in here arena is calling from Providence Rhode Island Reno you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call am I in a primary care doctor Johnston Rhode Island just outside of Providence and um it's a wonderful conversation I'm outside of my office just nodding my head very enthusiastically about all the comments that people are making 'em and I had read Michael's article and center\nOf how we speak to our patients about this and I just wanted to comment on the um the nuances of how you speak to people about this\nConversation because it's so individualized so a lot of times I'm trying to frame how I speak to people about focusing on their health and you know wanting to care about the quality of food that they're putting in their bodies and the benefits of exercise for how they feel about themselves\nAnd then from the patient side of things a lot of times people want to lose weight you know not just for their help that they they care about how they look and what how they feel

U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas Brandon running house joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston joining us\nFrom Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel like you feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between\nCrews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOh what is the the Texas race mean to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nActually Lopez learned to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth\nAnd the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc that are ... not monolithic\nAs Brennan was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and Latinos are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if\nGet loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policies here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who say that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group\nA Latino voters is that\nThey haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore costs a lot of money in Texas\nAnd progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see\nA good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party I'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work than has yet Ian\nI see a brand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent yeah\nThey're they're low overall um\nRecent polling has gotten more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nTed Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of\nMore continuous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump but there's a lot of friction so\nI see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here as potentially influential in this race I mean white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election that's really gonna what's probably drive any kinds of success that Iraq fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challenges the congressional level many of whom have\nA really harness this vote and could potentially do well but I also think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks ... considerably in favor of better work they don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for\nPeople who are over forty but it is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual growth of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being a poor partner\nPlaces like Ford been county here outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another level of success the Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in in this race in November\nWell it's always the wild card and elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always say a big reason that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it's because it's a non voting state so if you get all these populations who don't usually vote\nThat could change what Texas looks like if you changed the electorate you can change who gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term I mean this is a weird mid term because\nAnd you know all that they typically like Democrats aren't likely to vote during that time so if if that's different is year like this could look different than most ... terms yeah and so I'm seeing for example\n... I'm a a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever shown up and listen to you talking to to to voters or or potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so is he hoping\nTo dry out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the taxes that we've seen in other places we saw that in New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nLike what he's betting on yeah yeah that would go had written in ...\nOh sorry I was going to say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout is in ... in mid term years you're talking about\nProbably on the order of about forty percent which is\nExtremely low now I think we'll have a turnout probably spike a little bit in the selection because you definitely have the energy that we've seen 'em and so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you still have about two and a half million unregistered Texans who could otherwise register\nThe Latino population is only registered to vote at about birding forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there are still some fundamental voting demographics and make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide\nOkay well I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should note that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and to constant battle roast campaign as well invited them or or one of the represent their representatives to join us today\nA Iraq's campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our class but we do our due diligence on that part but let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his\nContentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president on substance and we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax kind of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations we're seeing record low unemployment\nTexans lives are better so yes I could have chosen\nTo make it about myself to be selfish and say you know what my feelings are hurt so I'm going to take my marbles and go home but I think that would have been not doing the job I was elected to\nThat Senator Ted Cruz on September twenty second let's take a call here Dan is calling from San Antonio you're on the air Dan\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em I wanted to say that well there's a lot of work and I know don't have all that much time but I\nDid want to say that about two or gives me and my family than ... that we haven't felt love generation or my parents would say it's like John F.

chocolate bar the we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez Brandon rotting house and Abby Livingston\nAs well unless you're a some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to you and and watching on their televisions\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\nOnly wear\nIn every community in every county [noise]\nDallas often\nGeorgetown walks actually Brian charges more do\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto O'Rourke campaign and here's some sound from an ad that ripped the Senator Ted Cruz's campaign is running\nThe dog not a chance to do\nThey're from Senator Ted Cruz Britain running has that that Ted Cruz ad or\nTalk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold\nDear I mean the the right to gun ownership of the ideas that I'm a that you maybe liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah but you're going to say this was something that holds the Texans hold dear because it's what country music but I think that's true as well\nThere's definitely a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign to understand how to run in taxes they know that there's a certain like guys as you say for voting um to keep you know people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely enough Republican\nSupport in a midterm election that an organic\nKind of campaign that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work or work has to tangibly make up about a million votes and the just sure as God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in the term so the difficulty of trying to make up that\nWith a campaign like Cruz's running which prime to Republicans and primes conservative it just makes it really difficult well\nLet's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air\nHi I'm just calling and I made millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I had voted for Donald Trump\nAnd um I grew up in a conservative household and they had then it's conservative my whole family is but I've been very encouraged and I and voting for that to work that election in November just because he looking beyond party line and I think that's so important\nTo 'em in this day and age right like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI Am a mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that don't work is going out there and and making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing\nChristine touched a few quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year yes I did okay so what's changed their\nHand in that um I really I whenever he within twenty the female action\nAnd how you get like the talk that whenever I can do\nUm president trial thing just how\nLike how he's steady getting sand and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that you're a true um I think it's important that pregnant true colors men how he just\nWas really again President Trump knows and he's for him like\nThat show you something about the need personality now I really appreciate how that your work is just um he is who he is\nOf course the matter is that you can ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that ah you you you think that you you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the campaign recently right to a controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or\nA review for a Broadway musical of where he in the review he wrote some I'm an unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seemed to be their phenomenally large body parts or need to say it does that concern you\nUm I I don't know um [noise]\nKnow he's apologized for it ... and\nHonestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for the holiday but just don't get that for women's rights\nYeah ... I I just wanted to I don't know it was a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably is what gets us in trouble so so thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked to\nThe we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more\nPositive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In Texas that's just sort of uh uh I'm at I Would call these women has been should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a tough the conundrum he was and I do think if this is John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave\n'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military and are working to ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful\nUm and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated friendly with people like me and my vision of public trust in power who have been unable to resolve this brings jobs just for what has been drawing and just all from generating dressed up in this country and normally peacefully\nWhile they argue this country are watching these games on me to bring in our cars to this problem to ensure that restrict regard as water they were doing it and I can think of nothing more Americans than ever before [noise]\n\nActually Lopez ah as I mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas\nWell I mean if you look at the black vote in Texas I Would say it went over really well specifically among black voters yeah something like Ninety seven percent approval according to like one latest poll on that one might be a little high but it it's not unlike most polls that have come out\nUm you know conservatives this is red meat for them this is something that Ted Cruz has been talking about um the NFL but then that the protest during the national anthem he's been talking about his rallies\nBecause it really frustrates conservative um they see this as like disrespectful to the flag into veteran so you know if you look at like democratic base voters this is something that they are so excited to hear you know a Democrat\nI'm standing up for racial injustice in their eyes and then on the on the other side you know conservative voters you know this is a polarizing issue\nStraight I buy this Brenda running house I mean I think ... outside of Texas political watchers are saying\nThat perhaps this is the way ... talks about these issues are is one of the reasons why he's getting so much traction there that it's not", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "03"}
