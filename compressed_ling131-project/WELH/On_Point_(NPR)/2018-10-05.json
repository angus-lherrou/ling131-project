before\nBefore the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings from regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if you're in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you were at\nEight hundred forty three eight to five five as I said and we've got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website ah for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says\nI live in a college town my residence is surrounded by college housing Thursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students carrying racks of course the next party\nA until the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed this shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York\nHe's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research on high risk alcohol consumption in college students for three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you\nThank you very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us and what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this the stories I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus or drinking culture now is it or we had a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think uh what what I was hearing from them is not something I'm calling you will hear students or\nOr even graduate says they reflect back I have to say um we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were even going back Thirty years ago if I might say a quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campuses based on\nA scores scores of studies the overarching in irrefutable findings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking\nIt is significant and sometimes quite triage and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're out their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old\nAnd those as compared to any other each population and compared to non college young adults are the same age ... this is the heart of of the problem is when we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk\nThose levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains having said that\nEven given the relative high rates of problem drinking\nBeen in previous decades the norm amongst college students\nThe best measures of a of of of high risk drinking or about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally in high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent\nMight be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers and it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students consume two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on a campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched\nOne quarter of students are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consume so the high risk drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious problem\nConnection some significant ... yeah so so it was a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe said it but I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that\nWell uh sometimes today with the word a binge drinking issues and typically what is used most commonly and measures are measures such as using\nFive or more drinks at a setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise]\nMore recent decades that we have better measures that focus on you used to talking about drinking five or four or more in a two hour period because that is sitting sometimes for college students might mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nUh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up to a high risk level such as a point oh eight which was the I'm a legal limit or in terms of driving\nWhen a ... one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas\nAnd that's a so if we're talking about drinking a five or more in a two hour period without intention of some of the students were describing to alter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yeah so what I think is interesting\nAbout what the difference may potentially be if we are going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades is that\nThere does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I've spoken to my parents are people from previous generations seems to be different it seemed people seemed shock that there are just handles outside or whatever it's easiest to get hold of\nEasily available sit like basically right off of that year freshman year\nAnd I don't know maybe ... or jak find that to be similar experiences at their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[noise] yeah um I think probably a fifty fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking heart alcohol or beer on depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for um hell gates before football game tended to be more beer\nIn may jak McCarthy is with us he's a Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State university and Wesley Perkins is with us as well he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and

of law\nJak McCarthy is with us he the Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges he's been conducting research\nOn high risk alcohol consumption for several decades where at one eight hundred for two three eighty five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about three to eat\nAnd the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find it's shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna\nSo that's a Steven if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nThat's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself\nNow insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just\nLet me just talk to Madeline and Brianna and jak here I mean respond to what's what Steven saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you\nIs it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people are used to relieve stress 'cause I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major ways to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress to grow with your friends and have a couple of drinks are proud of saying you got on Thursdays there'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks\nThere's there's not like people aren't going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight and gets some more of like you just it catches up with like you go to a party and there's like\nThere's alcohol there and you started drinking drinking and then you blackout but there's a million different ways relieve stress the bug me out is not a common one I Would say\nOK so Brianna against even are being says uh why do you find a shocking to hear that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak their million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in the what you said your how ... that he can go for a run or you you go to the gym\nLaying down on you um or ultra light jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class and he'd grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and say you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time um at least not now in law school in undergrad when maybe your responsibilities weren't as much as they are for me now um\nYou might go out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that\nBut certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to draw a different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least\nIn my license blackout is kind of used almost colloquially like you you you're like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of an normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nWe're garlic as to what the comment on lines and [noise] I don't like I don't know that\nWe are all black out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language out in a way that it might not have done before [noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the erotica\nHi thank you for taking my call um I just uh from here I already\nGraduated from college and hearing all and the drinking scene in as crazy even outside of college we have Bourbon Street in that kind of like Dr party scene of the nation\nBut I just feel like sometimes people are a little a sheen to speak truthfully about really what goes on and drinking and it almost sounds like it's a choice\nTo black out when I've seen people blackout it doesn't seem to me like they do it on purpose they just get to a point where they can't control that drinking anymore so I guess my question would be do you think that it's always up to you whether you're going to a blackout or not or if in or that\nYou get to a certain point where you just can't control and that's when like\nThings with what we can with Josh ... are happening and maybe people say like oh maybe he doesn't remember or maybe they just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like\nI don't know it's just like lie and basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the cakes and everything like that have to be a blackout and from what your guest\nAre they speaking they ... it's like corroborating that if\nMy ... you can't control that you're going to get to that point right time\nVeronica thank you for your call jak McCarthy and we'll turn to you on that or I mean you heard the question what do you say\nOh my definitely suited for the blackout especially I think\nWe're missing important too to some people do they have like bigger issues the nobody knows about too sometimes they do grow up to drink and like kind of forget about their problems but I think that's also like another reason people are walking up there because they have issues that you don't judge me know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out of the bars\nThey have other issues and the the um ... because they are trying to cover up those is ... ... what what's your response to that question well I think\nIf if you start for me are going to a party are going to a book or a point of view

serious\nThoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\n\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy an American flag\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot and must not will not set the bar so\nLow\nSo I'm at I'm president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long for on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments\nThat the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice judge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way they're tearing it his audience crowds of\nFar left protestors still filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides that weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it\nMore recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nNow listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat's where I'm a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\n\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence\nGreat confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden\nUntil of course a number of judge Kavanaugh fast set in straight\nEarlier this week just stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity they've started the indebtedness say\nThis is our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice this is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are um are totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\n\nIt was about a clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats are considered is nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote was called for a few weeks\nThere are efforts played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were broach distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice ...\n... women\nHustled vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem they all players weren't working\nThe distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus a pen which\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character so is there a matter of president the old tactics weren't working one going to get the job done the resistance\nDemanded more\nTry something new they said well we all know what happened next\nI'm corroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons one such allegations shared by Dr Ford and coughing up to the Democratic side of the ...\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community collected test and all they organized a new hearing and most recently I asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI\nInvestigation\nBy and embarrassed that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWas produced a support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI and foreign\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWell not wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they have been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yet again\nI Believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nThe latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty year old allegations\nWeren't treated as essential witnesses never mind that they didn't actually wouldn't necessarily say they didn't want us anytime\nSo let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly in possession of here say they'll say first heard thirty five years after the suppose\nAbsolutely and reducing the number of senators that there's ... very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people that are close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely around even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things kind of do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central a two one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for the magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime really of campaigning for a change to federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as that goes through the rules are killers\n[noise] mystery to me Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow\nWe're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is a no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live a vote is in is is fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm sense the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or have assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference what we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay the telegraph really even when he made the compromise with ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has gotten into Delaware went ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for a cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report the Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among them\nAll right it in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote NPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nAnd Steve the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated\nOn the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less close Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only we only had ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced this keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabin all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you're going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nHe's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally not quite final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex component has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate\nMarco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nIf they could be with us\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the terms the terms are barely a month away that's the big ... big\nIt was looking for something to get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking\nIn the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy hasn't gap has a lot of the surveys have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week really narrowed in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparently gain and enthusiasm right now we're in a month out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters\n... and that was a challenge for us going into the metro it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more apt up and the people that are kind of fat and happy\nBut now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism and Republicans as a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in\nThe Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of a nail in the coffin in terms of locking down for ... years yeah\nAlex Conan to I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined\nTo have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and end up while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee\nFrom a Republican perspective we wanted we wanted to have a a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think in part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely while their character assassination continues and then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor\nWhich is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee another solid\nA judge on the Supreme Court that is a great deliverable for for our base just like tax reform us a good deliverable for our base I think if you're a Republican voter who has mixed feelings about Trump's personality as frankly I Do you look at these results over the last two years between tax reform\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and a West Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she goes in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving is covered politics for very long time as well good morning to get both\nIn mourning mourning study thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple of weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice\nPresuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\nWell it was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick\nFrom his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance sport sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is that closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually\nAnd to um to take on legal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe don't do even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly we're not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding presidents so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in it and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that ...\nHigh push it that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave a speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block\nA action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there've been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnother one being Susan Collins of Maine who issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that you spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to rip out to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nVoting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride run open\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would she do that\nWell the the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't and\nAt the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor she has not said that let's be she did not say that\nAnd and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option she may I don't think she's actually\nAbout who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure\nGood time but there was a time when the rules were different when that sort of thing what happened you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe only fifty two votes to pass and now you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote\nAnd win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who is a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote\nAnd then there was a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the facts free verdict of the mob and the media would let out over the actual evidence\nMade sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the Senate will have the files or\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer today with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ...\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learned this news of the fifty one forty nine vote to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch uh as you guys have been talking about uh that should actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch the next twenty four hours a and they are the uh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know\nShe might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know he deserves a vote I'm going to vote no but he deserves to vote that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe mansion who\nI think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a his vote today a to a vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now\nUh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing\nAnd then there's the reality of politics we're deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one or plausibly although it's a long shot in both houses of Congress could flip\nAnd we have mentioned in our live coverage here\nThat there are about ten Democratic senators who were seen as vulnerable representing states that voted for President Trump and now up for reelection themselves nine of them chose to vote against this nominee even though it was perceived as potentially\nBy bagels the bagel bakeries offering catering with bagels and cream Jews locks bladders sandwiches salads bag lunches pastry and fruit Wakefield and if you arrive bagels are ride dot com\nAnd the next fresh air Wendy Whalen a former principal ballerina reflects on what it was like to retire\nAfter nearly Thirty years with the New York city ballet following an injury and then starting a new life she's a subject of the documentary wrestling this creature also Jess credit Kevin White had will have a ... tribute to jazz bassist Jimmy plant and join us [noise]\nUm\nBy what your ears are telling you this was on point and I'm David Folkenflik\nWe're talking with the actor and comedian Eli temper about her new memoir my squirrel days will touch on the comedic topics and tougher ones including the themes of surviving trauma in workplace harassment and think a little bit about the ways\nWe learn from ah sitcoms in their handling of burning issues here right across from me in Studio here in New York City is of course the ... Eli Kemper Emmy nominated started to Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt right there you heard the show's theme song A L e a\nKimmy Schmidt it was as you say in your book and rightly so it is\nCrazy pitch of a series or just you know the two sentences tell us to set up of of of what Kimmy Schmidt is and how she writes in her it it it it you know ... where she is when she arrives at our television\nIt's insane so she said the backstory of to me is that she was kidnapped\nWhen she was fourteen years old I'm held underground in a bunker for Fifteen Years and then rescued by the FBI or where she is a brought back into the world and decides to make a new start for herself and of course New York city\nThat isn't always starts so I mean it it gets a little crazier from there but I mean it it um\nThe idea for the show that someone somewhere with ... because that doesn't seem like a sitcom to me\nNo I mean it seems it seems like the set up for an extremely tough tough drama that's exactly you know you could imagine HBO tree you know the guys who did the wire doing this very differently absolutely\nAnd yet it at Robert garlic and Tina Fey made it into a an extremely funny show\nSo tell me about that because what you you know it's it's a it's a the sets the your outfits like everything is incredibly brave almost passed All right yeah and you could not be ... you know you as you mentioned earlier of a temper as ... character yeah but you could not be basically a more default sunny earlier\nI Love that about ... because she is sort of unabashedly girlish she wears bright pink pastel pants much you might like LA's chagrin because I don't I don't like us\nBut we're in frightening that she was floral shirts you were jewelry that says Kenny she's a she's a very very girlish person and at at the same time she is this fierce\nTenacious warrior who has been through something fun to think of all and\nI'm so difficult that I Can't actually imagine what that must have been like\nAnd yet she continues to choose to think the best and people and that it's mysterious to me I don't know if you're born with that\nSort of tenacity or or if you have a force to develop it during you know at a test like the one she was put through but um I think it's I think it's remarkable and and she's such she's an admirable beyond admirable person\nAlso very childish yeah uh you know in the way she deals with people in season one of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt a roommate and friend Titus a tries to give her a goodbye hug on the first day of school staff\nIf you're a Titus uneducated as the\nSomeday when you're gay black man you have a ... few like this [noise]\n[laughter]\nTruly truly funny a A N\nEndearing and loving of the same time there's an undercurrent oblique it in all this stuff how do you how do you look at this rather dark comedy with such cheerful knows\nI don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject as as very serious as the one\nUm that can meet the the torture that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because bad stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it isn't a writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think it's an it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just [noise]\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know ... ... fine and sunny one moment and then horrible and a kind of hellish the next and and you have to navigate those times so and it was that I went abroad and so I'm like all of a pro flex life but it does\nWell so you just obviously she'll created by Tina Fey moved on initially for NBC Weaver was as a Robert ... who's the head of entertainment and she was like this is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful let's sell this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about this right\nI Do and I I think really don't know the conversations that took place so I I get to plead ignorance but um yes it was originally slated to be on NBC and again a you know I I think it\nSpeaks to the discomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl who's been underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus was semi rural school can she didn't get to complete high school friend there's something ...\nI mean what where would you be if you'd been held up until ... twelve or something\nYou know I'm alarmed because sometimes when McKinney doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people in two thousand Eighteen behave I'm like oh I didn't know that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not ... not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I think she may have gotten on Instagram before you honestly honestly I Swear she's [laughter] I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think that she is necessarily naive because about certain things because she has been hurt her adolescence stunted it's it's Arrested Development and she's coming out um as a\nTwenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life no big deal on thank you [laughter] ah but she is she's you know\nI she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nIn a lot of ways you guys sort of\nI I wouldn't say that you had on address but you certainly come into contact with a lot of issues that people are are working through in thinking about\nA couple of episodes I'm thinking about in particular here's a clip from season for of unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and you can hear it can be arguing with friend he's the leader of a men's rights group called the Innocence Project [laughter] way by Bobby ...\nFemales have it's so easy ... we please flick I'll come when your body makes milk it's beautiful\nWell as a woman I can tell you it's not easy breezy beautiful cover girl\nShe was sort of trickery council I've been a junior salesmen uh Darryl bridal for Fifteen Years I've seen would females truly are\nAll you care about is the ring and dress and not\nOnly will go with me because the women who come in here are engaged\nOn their mom and make it a point he's making a very good point or is it the other episode of\nCoworkers accuse your character a of sexual harassment can be Schmidt sexual harassment in the workplace in this scene you'll hear Comey attempting to soften the blow of firing an employee named\nCareer she touches his shoulders and then I could you not she dropped her parents in an attempt to demonstrate her own humiliation in the moments like you can be here I\nLike the new every day see let me be worse isn't the best place for that maybe our friendship belongs in the night so you get when I'm trying to say\nI don't want you to feel embarrassed embarrassing stuff can happen to anyone else\nWould you look at that ... would you look at her pants dropped her cancer ups of knowing supper why are you guys dealing with me too [laughter] I\nKnow outweigh right I think it sort of

her new memoir my squirrel days we're going to be talking coming minutes about her presence and it made a crop of really strong women in comedy names that come to mind among others Tina Fey Amy Poehler ... killing\nA camper started the Netflix Original series unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is with me in the studio thanks for being with us again thank you for having me so I just want to pick up on something that we were talking about uh uh during the break a which is where's the line you guys joke about me to you guys make clear her feminine a you know can be Schmidt feminist higher\nYou know and also yet you have Herbie sort of comedians do fits almost backing into being a complete sexual harassment in the workplace\nUm how do you joke about something that's so serious\nI don't have the answer and I and then then struggling and sort of wondering about that every day because I it does seem like so much has changed\nWould never want to trivialize over little anyone's concerned and so I don't know I don't know where is the line between making a joke and making a a an observation and so um I think it's it um\nIt's a it's an enlightening time and it's a powerful time because it leaves are feeling a comfortable and secure in coming forward and and of revealing what has happened to them and there's nothing more powerful than owning a truth like that\nAnd I I don't know if you know it's it's jokes that I think you could've made\nA year ago or two years ago art or no longer funny and so\nTrying to figure that out is a good or bad for you I I mean I luckily\nA lot of my humor does not go into like you know um that that kind of materials so I I I'm a by that I mean like I'm not known for like my offensive bold comedy but I think that it is\nWhen writing the book I was I was very my editor and I were very concerned with how on something might come across I again I wasn't writing a lot of like um [noise]\nUh uh subjects that were enormously sensitive but at the same time something that you might just think oh I'm just rattling off a little joke it might not be\nSeverely didn't point is it like Michael Jordan he was like look I don't get involved political stuff because the Republicans are by sneakers just like Democrats or basketball fans to or is it that you actually that's not where do you want to speak publicly you just want to be sort of apart from from from that stuff\nTo things yes I Am the Michael Jordan comedy yes I think that's very your icon on the low [laughter] thank you for recognizing that sure and second yeah I mean it it does seem like a a cop out I mean if you you can't not be involved in politics now I mean I I don't mean you have\nTo you can't not be political now it's the too\nCrazy and a momentous a time so I think you can't just say well I'm not going to get involved but I also think that a lot of people are talking to and with people who already agree with them so\nI I don't know how much um I don't know how much to weigh in on that because\nThere are in some ways like the last question on to someone else is going to do you think that can be Schmidt ultimately in the way I handled this in\nAddition to getting less in addition to make sure the humor was pointed out can be a you know advance certain understanding of certain issues on this stuff or do you think that it's hey we're here to make people laugh even if it's in a funny circumstance and that's what we were to do\nI think there was definitely a feminist I'm a ... an intention when when especially when writing this season for and again I'm not in the writers and so I don't want to speak for them but I\nKnow I don't think it was just about trying to me I mean that's what's so insane to me and why these guys are magicians is because they're able to uh make these points\nUm both political and some of the points while also keeping like jokes that are pristine and just so sharp and funny in in the show at the same time but I I Would no I I think it's too crazy time to avoid that\nWe played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids which itself was\nReally funny at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... or apparently you said you shared a questions about women in comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch way text talk them yet when he fourteen you took on the question that you said that you've been asked not just by fans by reporters and the question was are women funny\nFunny yes\nSome women are funny\nAren't funny I [noise] it's it's hard to you how some women are tall [noise]\nIf I have some and then like to ride the train well others prefer to take the we are different [laughter]\n[noise] they are the apparently the women are different from one another's what you're saying as well as from from the\nRight I think that women are different from one is in that in that I ... I Am talking about women are all sorts of different things and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\n[noise] so but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know a meta question from our borders standards you know on these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions right so hopefully some of them was muted than others but I I think\nThat if someone bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know for reporters have a conference of what happens but everyone decided like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women and I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay are so\nWomen can be funny but I have ... being honest I never had a thought that women weren't funny I ... I think it was\nBased on the box office success and bridesmaids that that a demonstrated studios that you can make\nA very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny is so stupid because it why are you talking about yeah they've always been funny\nWhen he went after a delay Christopher Hitchens you know the noted British and intentional controversial as he actually wrote this thing for Vanity Fair saying ... obviously women are not funding they don't need to be us was that something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in the two thousands without still a thing\nI never encountered that and I know some women have an ... an improv at I think and I said it did a less of it are citizens brigade theater and the people's improv theater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from when I have encountered it it's from um [noise]\nListen it's from white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from uh some people I went to college with who who work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed at the movie was funny and I thought get out of my inbox because what's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised\nMe furious because but I I you know it but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think which is that there's it's not an issue if someone is in a sketch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funny or they're not\nTo send our backs and congrats on the fact that apparently white guys can sometimes make money back that yes [laughter] sometimes you were with some real giants here as we mentioned you work with Tina Fey admitted killing a Christian wig\nA oh what did you what did you learn what do you take from working with somebody like Tina Fey who really has sort of I think public we tried to articulate how she's tried to model things for women comedians we'd be like you know you got to be tough to stand up for what you believe what did you take from working with her\nThat what you just said which is what I'm most of my um most of the I guess I Would say lessons I learned from Tina Fey or just by watching her because that women lead by example and she doesn't complain and she works tirelessly and and and she treats everyone fairly and kindly\nAnd she's very grounded so I think that there's um she\nEmpowers women by doing she just she she's she talks about it but she also just does it and so\nLike when you walk us through what that means a little bit for listeners who may not a folder as closely as you well\nI guess it means that it's not it's not like it's a ...\nFifteen times I mean it's it's really selling her best selling book which is just\nBrilliant and she talks about this in her book being the boss and I there's so\nThere's something in her introduction where she says I'm that she gets asked a lot like what's it like being in charge of all those people and she compares it to she says oh it's like it must be like when people ask Donald Trump hey how's it feel to be in charge this was before Donald Trump was president by the way and and her point being that nobody is asking Donald Trump that although\nPeople should be asking that question but um it's because you think people are now I think people are saying [laughter]\n\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks or SUVs and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nFrom WVU are Boston end NPR I'm David Folkenflik and this is on an FBI review mass\nProtests and unprecedented public appeal to the Senate is finally police to determine whether judge Brett Kavanaugh joins the Supreme Court and plus the New York times looks behind the curtains of President Trump's finances and finds decades of tax Dodgers and even for\nA new NAFTA for the U.S with Mexico and Canada only please call it U.

S. M. C. A. the new fare better deal he's been promising since the campaign\nWhat do you make of the decision by Jeff Bezos the richest man in America to ensure that all us Amazon employees are making minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour we're wanting to hundred and forty three to five five that is one hundred for two three talk you could also falls on the twitters and the facebooks at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Jackie ... percentage of the Daily Beast on point use analyst Jack Beatty and here in Studio with Catherine Rampell of the Washington Post\nKevin let's take a moment and turn to Trump's taxes that was a bit he must of the story but the New York city times you know taking a look at not just taxes will really finances of the president what did we learn from that and why do you think it matters\nA I think we are all shocked shocked to learn that Donald Trump ... major fortunate not by the sort of his brow but you know the old fashioned way inheriting the money from his father and then cheating the IRS I Know it's it's a huge shock to all of us\nWell you say that but he told a ton of books she said that a lot of TV shows and whatever yeah he also presented this missing built this thing on the idea that he's a self made guy here\nHe is absolutely not he inherited I think something like four hundred million dollars from his father in today's dollars uh if you had put that into the asking the five hundred you know he would have already been a billionaire without having to do anything on a lake of work he is an incredible self self promoter I Will get\nAt the contents of this monster ... day you see that again and again this guy who supposedly has a Midas touch 'em\nYou know make made a huge business errors and had to be bailed out by his daddy this happened repeatedly that's happened with his casinos and has happened with other businesses so this idea\nThat he has some sort of um you know special insight into how to run a business or or how to cut a deal I Believe he is charming I Believe and you know and and I\nI Believe he is probably an effective dealmaker in the sense that he can bully people into getting what he wants but the idea that he is self made is just bogus\nJust bogus well let's play a little bit of a what his press secretary Sarah Sanders had to say during a press briefing at the White House on Wednesday a you know the report had accused the president of questionable tax schemes and as you say Dodgers threw out here's what she had to\nTotally false attacks based on an old recycled news story I'm not going to sit and go through every single line of a very boring fourteen thousand word story the only thing I Will say one thing the article did get right was it showed that the president's father actually had\nA great deal of confidence in him in fact the president brought his father into a lot of deals they made a lot of money together so much so that his father went on to say that everything he touched turns to gold\nEverything he touched turned a goal Jack Beatty when you read that story if it confirmed things that you already believe\nA or not or what news do you take from from having read that that peace\nWill trust a dimension of his um bogus self presentation you\nKnow he was he was a gilded diaper guild diaper your red diaper babies there was a gilded started for baby and you know the one phrase that sticks out as self made sham or just the degree of this and then with the points to Catherine made\nA email questions of the galaxy which seemed to be there an outright fraud which the some evidence of it's just the the his his upward failures you know you were just keep failing and ... ... plaza hotel bust\nTrump era large bust casinos fail or in other words displaying in finance and business the bad judgment about economic matters that we see is president\nAnd a and and and and David Farenthold who is really got the French fries on his taxes are so low points out that just when daddy's um you know contributions were\nFading out two thousand three two thousand for income the Russian oligarchs to fill the vacuum of daddy and and you know the the two people you'll never say anything against her daddy and ...\nBut Jackie could sense when you think about this story about one of those things that strikes me is that part of my fascination is is that the president didn't release his tax returns has been done nominees both presidential parties for the last I think forty years\nAh what repercussions if any other likely to be on the hill from what we've learned at least is this significant glimpse behind the Kurds\nWell yes and your abs and one of the biggest takeaway from the story and this was on this point has been made but it just gives us the best picture of Donald Trump's financial situation\nI'm In the past that we've had yet we don't have anything recent now speaking of recent it really a lot of this depends on who wins the midterms because Democrats say both I'm Richard Neal\nAnd Senator Ron Wyden they will be the top of their respective committees in the house in the Senate that could request his tax returns and both of them came out right away and said that's what we're going to do\nWe're going to get him to go if the Democrats take over if they try now they're going to be told though\nOr the president gets to her old as big good news ah he's just a his administration has just been able to strike\nOr a new version of NAFTA or as he puts it to a brand new deal ah with our neighbors to the north of Canada are neighbors the south in Mexico for this trade deal a on Monday Trump addressed how's rocky relationship with Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau might've affected his ability to complete the deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada\nWe had very strong tensions it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's a much different deal to renew do not NAFTA ridden it's brand new deal\nJustin Trudeau had his own thoughts during his press conference a speaking about the trade pact and hero the deal is a victory for all three countries as things North American trade would be in a much more stable place\nThat would have to preserve the fundamental principle of the original agreement which is that when you're trading partners ten times your size you need roof you need a level playing field\n... is this a brand new deal you know so why not\n[laughter] there's some stuff in there that is slightly more protectionist there's some stuff in there that it's slightly more trade liberalizing but for the most part this deal looks a lot like the whole deal in fact it's kind of two deals to trade deals that Trump has previously called the worst trade deal ever\nSmash together that his NAFTA and the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP which\nObama had negotiated with eleven other countries and Trump immediately pulled us out of it as soon as he became president but yeah I mean it's funny we've spent basically the last year and a half\nAlienating our friends and allies punishing farmers and manufacturers with rounds of tariffs and counter terrorists and busting apart and is a hard fought alliance that we had to try to alienate China and ended up basically in the same place we would have been had we not done any of those things and just\nProceeded with TV and more amicably\nDealt with Canada and Mexico who were by the way quite willing to to update NAFTA or they themselves had said many times are both as part of the TV the negotiations and otherwise\nThat NAFTA was old and needed some modernization you know it didn't it didn't include like e commerce and a bunch of things that didn't exist in the early nineties so we're basically where we would have been um had Trump not brought all of this damage and destruction\nSo I don't exactly know what the pay office I'm given that we have this long term damage now to our relationships with our allies\nI mean there have been some praise from even some liberal consumer groups would consider reunion I think praised as there are some other folks who say there's some things here that are good environmental when we were that was all in TPP so this is all you're saying that that there were they may have been some benefits this but the way you see it as that at the cost in our relationship\nWith our trading partners is actually the real harm here\nYes I think we wouldn't we did not need to um alienate all of these friends and allies who we needed to deal with other major trade problems I eat China um which again TPP was designed to try to contain\nA ... you know we we've basically\nUm I think permanently frayed or at least ... cause long term scarring to our relationships with these other countries and have very little to show for it because the things that most of the things that have been praised by labor groups by environmental groups and others were again in a deal that Trump ripped up last year ... and I think what\nJust ... yeah just interject here I mean that's right um but I think this is just it it goes back to being about the president and being about three brand and being about him being able to go on the campaign trail and say promises made promises kept an eye cancer I found out about matters\nGot more fuel jak you can send a

Twitter and find ... Facebook at on point radio\nI think one of the interesting questions uh that we have is how all these things play out what are the midterms gonna look like they're just ... few weeks away ... you talk to people on the hill ... what what forces did they say you're going to be shaping this election\nWell it's been really interesting the last two a day or two on me starting to hear some nervousness from Democrats um on the hill and elsewhere about how this Kevin uh a confirmation was playing out and usually because of all the allegations that were coming forward ... from either women and has passed\nThere was a thought that vote for cabinet what caused the backlash among women\nAs the as this has gone on and on so much more has come out there is a feeling I'm within Republicans and I don't care where what part of the party are talking about at this point that he's been under attack that this has been unfair and\nStarted to shift against and it started to your your starting deceived talking to Republicans in their internal polling you're starting to see the Republican base wake up and\nReally get back to get engaged and to get involved which is exactly what Democrats do not want so yesterday you were hearing from Democrats okay let's just get this over with so we can go on and start you know go back on the campaign trail and refocus\nOf people on other issues now will that momentum from the cabinet vote should he be confirmed today we do not know that had\nA I'm Sorry tomorrow um we do not know that yet but uh but if if he is confirmed will the anger on the right to be able to sustain itself for five weeks I have a hard time believing that just because of how fast the news cycle tends to go\nDressing room poll you know we talked about the legacy of Anita Hill Clarence Thomas in his uh sharing she of course has been on the bench ever since uh is it your sense of things have changed in any way as a result of these terms in terms of the conversation about uh about allegations of sexual assault on the way in which they're handled\nI think before the hearings I Would have said that yes we take these kinds of accusations much more seriously today in the wake of me too and the wake of greater awareness of the prevalence of um problems like sexual harassment and sexual assault\nYou mean as a result of hardy once I hardly yeah ... yeah so many major figures who has been accused of of various kinds of\nA sexual misconduct and have had a fall from grace as a result uh and I would add plenty of other you know Bill Cosby amongst others you know people who are like blood figures are very powerful figure now ... yes exactly um who have been punished to some extent for their behavior\nThat said the way that these hearings and accusations related to the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have shaped up um suggests somewhat of a different lesson which is that it's not so much that I'm\nA people on the left has become more fired up they were already fired up about issues related to me too and sexual misconduct instead you have people on the right more fired up if you had asked me a month ago whether I thought that having a Supreme Court nominee at a Trump nominated a Supreme Court pick\nA credibly accused of sexual assault whether that would be good for Republicans\nI would've said no that that is clearly not the lesson that we had seen we had seen that the the right as Jackie mentioned has become much more energized by this fight the left was already energized a again before all of this happen on these kinds of issues but now the writers and if you look at the enthusiasm gap\nBetween Democrats and Republicans going into the midterms it has greatly narrowed I think that this whole fight has in fact I've been good for Republicans ironically\nJak where did you see this do you see this end up playing playing out in the election or do you think that it's more likely when what we were talking about earlier about the economy\nI I I don't know I suggest he probably was right above the dynamics of you know the Republicans going to have lifted the good news about the ... ... should know will pass through the Democrats\nUh uh but uh but to get back to this you know ... this this the the ... accusations against judge cabin or you know we saw two thousand sixteen the character didn't matter to Republicans\nA group of political scientists who study the president's paddle a couple of hundred of them uh last year so that the president was already the worst president as an American history where we can't do that but he's certainly among the most of the worst characters who did president does lie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe house I'm In a house member there or someone running for a house seat who decided that he doesn't want to come to a rally with the the president because he doesn't want to be closely tied to him so I really do think it depends on where
