about this were equally surprised I was\nActually interviewing someone about agile which is this new workplace methodology that's become almost a religion and ah\nWe were talking about that and in the course of that conversation\nThe guy said oh no you got to talk to the lego people and I said with a lack of people said oh there's\nYou can pay three thousand bucks or five thousand bucks and become

Valley or Dan was not a writer at on the show at this time but this is from the pilot episode where Richard Hendricks played by Thomas middle ditch winds up in the doctor's office\nWhen he's faced with a really stress inducing decision whether or not to sell his company for ten million dollars or keep ownership of the start up he created for a lower price so in this clip you hear a Richard

in almost the exact same situation take the money or keep the company for\nWell from\nWhere he was brought into the arms off with a gunshot because he really regretted not taking that money\nA little black humor there about the pressures that telecom valley execs may face a but in reality things can get a little strange and most definitely uncomfortable if not out inappropriate because\nIn this next cut you're going to hear Bloomberg anchor Emily Chang diving into the front like world of Silicon Valley she did that in her book row Tokyo which was published earlier this year and she told Business Insider in February about the shocking details of some tech women's day to day lives\nI don't want to get into a hot tub in pitch investors like that and that's all holding up their what women want to do that while wearing a bikini and these things are really happening\nSo that's a Emily Chang are talking about one of the things that may happen ever does happen in Silicon valley now look the ... the thing about your book that I think it is the deepest point that you make it how\nSilicon Valley views it's actual employees an actual workers tell tell me more about that because part of what you wrote seems I'm very familiar to me in terms of how industrialists of\nOld also sell their workers\nRight only I think it's actually even worse so the the view today and Silicon Valley is that workers are essentially disposable\nWould you see you their fuel like the coal you throw in a steam engine to keep it going so you you hire them you you burn them out turn them out\nAnd high burn out I'm\nOddly enough it's counter to what Silicon Valley was even as recently as when I started writing about Silicon Valley in the late eighties\nAt that time the gold standard was something called the H. P. way right which was really human centric really employ centric it was a great place to work and to stay um ...\nPackard right Julie Packard and then ... and David Packard right they had a whole management theory about management by walking around they ended a profit share\nQuite a bit with their employees I mean it was it was the standard of an end looking would turn into a blue chip companies minute right no longer but [laughter] but it was at the top of the heap once the garage that that the bill and Dave H. P. and as a national landmark\nRight and and they the one thing I I loved about it too they would have a big picnic for the whole company once a year and your family's in there and they view the company as a family and they\nThe two of them would serve all the hamburgers you know they would sort of certain people are sort of symbolic but but you know there's a certain humility to it and they wanted people to stay for their entire careers they bought\nLand for employees to go camping in or a you know for recreation in different parts of the world where they had officers\nThat were really much a very much about the people in their country then the next wave in the seventies and eighties you had this sort of counter cultural way we have like the jobs Wozniak kind of thing and when I came into covering tech\nIn the late eighties it was still kind of hippy ... be counter cultural pro people was a great place to work if you landed a job and one of these places like oh\nFantastic and that\nHas radically changed and that's no longer you know [noise] that kind of place it's it's very stressful\nYeah we'll dig it just comes up and you're saying 'cause we've got a caller who was who's talking exactly this about um the value of employees are in this day and age so let me just get his say here Robert is calling from Omaha Nebraska Robert you're on the air\nFlow\nThat was saying that the value of an employer's ... an electric where your transactional issue can be turned on the news fine but it's not the start and there's nothing it's nothing new or just returning veteran for\nVirtually all capitalism ... it's silly things are unless you're willing to make ...\nRobert thank you so much for your call a deadlines what do you think about that means he's kind of thing when I said earlier that a lot of this sounds really familiar\nIt's it it does in a way I'm ... ... I went back in ... I'm going to read books by industrial is of of a previous generation and see what they what they thought so I read Henry Ford's memoirs and read Thomas watching junior who was the c._e._o. of IBM\nAnd a Lee Iacocca was not the rubber bands but and and Henry Ford\nObviously was not a nice guy yeah have you get to the very end of his memoirs and there's a last shop and you're like oh my God whoa whoa but be before that part so it's amazing he's saying I Am doing this to try to create as many jobs for his many human beings as I can\nAnd to treat them really well um he at one point had his stock go round and try to find jobs that\nDisabled people could do because those people are pushed out of the workforce by me all the jobs you could do if you only had one on\nFinding all the jobs you could do if you were blind make a list and then we're going to go higher those people so they can work and they can uh they can make make a living yeah\nBut at this so this is the key difference though right that there was a time I'm a ... not for every company but for many companies the point was to grow the company and doing so involved in trying to be the best employer they could be but ... you know\nCapitalism turned over to shareholder value creation that that was the ultimate goal of the company to serve the interests of shareholders so when that ... and and I guess what I'm saying when I'm Wondering is in your book are you writing that you think that that Silicon Valley because it's full\nOf some of these billion dollar valued companies that may or may not be turning a profit that essentially they put they put all the shareholder value creation on hyper speed that it it is by far the most important thing\nUm of anything that these companies can do and and that's the pernicious thing is is that what you're saying okay he's hyper\nCapital and it it's you have Nineteen Seventy the turning point is Milton Friedman publishes his famous essay about shareholder capitalism and every you know goes this is great all have to do is return or money to investors time my own compensation to the stock price and\nAnything I can do to make that happen is great got the pension fund\nYou know usually all in involves hurting employees\nAnd so you had four stakeholders you had a customer's employees the community and investors and Milton Friedman will investors come first now\nIts investors are the only ones who matter so you have companies in Silicon valley that have run for years have never made a profit don't read their employees well deliver what they call MVP minimum viable product\nUm dodged taxes will get apple and Google hiding all this money offshore and not paying taxes 'em\nAll to benefit investors companies were BCS have become fabulously rich a founders have become fabulously rich but the company itself is not profitable yes or help you to employees very well um so it's it's a really inside out kind of version of capitalism\nOkay well let's get another call here we're speaking with dandelions he's author of lab rats how Silicon Valley may work miserable for the rest of us Marge is calling from Lebanon, Connecticut Martin you're on the air\nHello thank you um [noise]\nI Want to say that I worked for a large insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut for thirty six years my father also retired from this company he worked there for years all the time I was growing up I Do not remember him working overtime he was home at five o'clock for supper every day we had weekends to go away and so forth now they'll\nThey'll twelve years I worked in a wonderful unit I was able to accomplish every project they gave me on time or before target date then they rearranged things five\nYears before I retired I retired a four years ago but five years before I retired\nThey reorganized and I became so overloaded with work and I had to uh I had to support many times more units and I used to support and I I could not sleep at night I I um [noise]\n[noise] support from pulling comes from Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and runners insurance through the guy go insurance agency additional information can be found a guy go dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto ten cent gauge working to make higher education more affordable\nWith is engaging limited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand he textbooks online homework access codes and study guys send gauge unlimited\nC.

that we're moving towards ... open cubes and collaborative workspaces but not much else\nYet a and Victoria Morrison on Twitter is saying real dandelions is making a good point here I Know some posts millennials and young people who reject current tech culture will they reinvented or find another way to make a living let's go to Steve who's calling from Boston, Massachusetts Steve you're on the air\nHow guys that then I have to take issue with some of the things that are your your perspective and I'll give you my own my own background I worked Fifteen Years for intel uh a good portion of that time I was actually working in the VCR investing and companies in Israel\nAnd then I left in ... and uh uh I work in our during you hear what you call a safari\nSilicon they're so expensive so far as in Israel that the people around the world and showing them what's going on in Israel and my my you're\nMy my perspective is is that most of the companies that I'm In touch with my experience when I was doing some interesting was that the best companies are the most successful companies were the ones who really put the emphasis\nOf the employees because basically the start of culture the culture is grounded in a knowledge in bringing your brain power bringing innovation bringing ideas\nThe human capital ... yeah and that's it\nThis one's doing drifted do well in my experience is that the people who are working in those environments are energized instructor ... enjoy your show at Georgia looking contribution\nWill Steve thank you so much for your call it's getting dancers months you\nKnow I I think you know I er completely in agreement I think there are there are companies doing that and and those people are happy\nUm um what\nWas say ... or you can see everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right and route Amazon warehouses are not like that\nUm ... when he mentioned I'm\nWorking in Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in this company\nAnd I'm a true story and I thought it like what do we come and even the BCS I called to that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise] anyway but yeah there are there is a lot of\nJust hoping stuff out there [laughter] yeah well in the ... let me just ask you briefly a are we\n... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we\n... are we over waiting the influence of these like the old for big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's because he was saying that he not obviously not every company is going this way is is are there actually maybe medium or a smaller size or come tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and you know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the better with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much but at the same time\nProductivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and out of ...\n... ... because I mean because with knowledge work the asset is the worker right it ... if not workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor is that's that's delivered that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down was quickly in order to\nA massage a profit for that quarter right just cut a workforce they go to church you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of a company or the workers themselves so\nMy question you new to you India is that in trying to shift perspective a little here um for for these tech companies or for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowering them more of that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nYeah I think it has to has to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and attention now that are kind of a two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male champ as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps so they never\nFour billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that work there I Know that they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally\nOr how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing those start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share is a private company um but they share a all of their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build up more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they are the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there for\n'em and then I'd also say like a again to companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate and the success of that company as well so everyone is invested in this excessive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top ah I think there's a lot to be said about having those\nMore flexible schedules and um you know enabling remote work I Know from my team or or just say multiple teams because they run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bulls and we plan those together for oh it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by the time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like\nSuch as long as we're getting a yeah hit the goal of how you you and your life now now are there are a lot more calls you want to get to hear but in ...\nWhich is not from you and what you're hearing from India\nOh you ... we we totally agree and and um\nThere's a a another company called Base Camp that are just in Chicago it's offered company and I I'm I'm sort of detecting a few common threads with with the other companies that you're talking about any and and that is one they have never took any PC\nTo they're not really obsessed with hyper growth are growing at an incredible rate they believe in slow growth they are profitable they charge money for their software and they make a profit they have no interest in going public they want nothing to do with Wall Street and when I looked through\nAnother list of companies that have parental you've been on the fortune magazine best places to work list there are I think twelve of them that have been on every year for Twenty years a lot of them are family owned\nMany of them are not public so you're not beholden to Wall Street so if you can kind of popped out of that funding model both the vc and the

edge\nUm I was in the I was in the White House with the president earlier this week when he spoke it was before a ceremony where he signed this big opioids bill but obviously that was a day Wendy's or when he suspicious packages began appearing on 'em and he said you know the full weight and the fall um support\nAnd the resources of the government\nUm is is being deployed to figure out who is sending them you know what is going on what is a connection we have seen\nA we know the FBI and all you know HGF all the related agencies are investigating this um so this is it's it's it's a

hierarchy in some ways of Democratic Party House Republican leaders responded to this\nRepublican leaders have has condemned this um you know they have made it clear from the start that they are not

on point radio\nMy guests today are Daniel deal of the trauma star some chemical Washington Post and of course our own news analyst shirt on point Jack\nBeatty up some men or the president has talked a lot this week about the caravan of migrants wending its way about a thousand miles south of the U.S border in Central America south of even of Mexico at this point ah\n[noise] that that is certainly gotten a lot of news coverage and it's a very real issue on the other hand I'm In the president's framing of it as part of a a as an issue of vital national security concern is it the sense that there is something that the president needs to address on a federal level or is there a sense of this is a turning attention mid term elections I think\nThat that I think he wants to make the sense that there that the government needs to take action but it is important to point out the facts here\nThat this caravan while it is traveling we've kept the latest an estimate from Mexican officials is that it is about more than nine hundred\nMiles south of the U.S Mexico border so it is still significantly far away um you know experts in the region and ... on the issue has said for a long time that these are people who are you know seek or who are fleeing from violence and terrible conditions and their home countries\nAnd trying to find refuge in the United states and that\nYou know the vast majority of these are asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states um I Do want to point out one new development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block um you know people at the border who come here to seek asylum it's they're considering using kind of the same\nNational security rationale that they use to invoke the travel ban and the different iterations of the travel ban in the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final iteration of that band was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court\nAnd one option that the administration is now considering is doing that on the southern border\nUm you know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBut the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers can go on in addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the president become more I'm more focused on in these last several days and weeks\nDuring a bill or our listeners may or may not know that I'm as well as reporting for the star from Washington you kind of bird dog the statements from the president for major officials are pretty much in real time and rather extraordinary way I'm On Tuesday vice president Mike Pence or both\nEasterners mixed in with Central American migrants moving toward the U. S. borders here's what the vice president had to say\nThe United states of America intervenes and prevents him terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable that there would not be individuals or from the middle east as a part of this growing the Caribbean\nDaniel how accurate at the president and vice presidents remarks been in terms of characterizing what we know about that a caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in like a logic class um you know he he\nWas President Pence made his statement that his arguably factual this was based on department of homeland security statistics about people on terror walked those being prevented from entering the country and then made a completely unfounded link a leap\nFrom that to the care of and you know just because\nTen terrorists or suspected terrorists or let the terrorists are prevented from entering the country um has no obvious connection to people are trying to walk into the country from Honduras Guatemala\nAnd so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in the ministry Asian\nUm has made logical leaves and completely baseless claims about this ... that had no granting it ... in reality at all\n[noise] Jack Beatty is there nothing to the idea that that we should be concerned about the the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise a number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum\nWe certainly should be concerned about it but we should be concerned under the age of civil law laws which involve the right to seek asylum in the United states\nYou know what's going on here is the politics of fear of which Mr Trump is a master during the two thousand campaign he let it out is it real power is I don't want to use the word see here he's playing on fear\nA fear of the nation under attack by brown skinned people coming up from the south\nAnd reporters have talked to people as far north as Minnesota there was an interview with the times with a woman in Minnesota who said you know\nIf these people aren't stopped they're liable to come up here in Minnesota\nAnd to be going into the cabins that that uh people have a summer homes and staying there for the winter and then when the people who ... who come in the summer they'll the the these these ah these migrants will be living in their cabins course they'd have to walk the thousand miles to the border and then the Fifteen hundred miles to\nTo uh to Minnesota but this is this is what's here is the magnification of deep seated American anxieties especially among conservatives about keeping the country you know ...\nWe've got a call from El Paso Texas said John is calling on my understand if you do some work down there that's related to this\nNew or they take my call you work with a a little militia out here where mobilized and on the order to make sure that this caravan not make it into our country we're disgusted with what you people in the media have been doing a we're sick of your rhetoric at a press\nThat we're not going to happen not going to share what we do advocate has its good discourse back and forth and and uh just disagreement a in a civil way but we're not we're not going to have people abusing each other on the air or we are going to return however to one of the comments that uh that I Want to follow up with Daniel Dale of Toronto Star\nA and think about the question he hadn't flag questions about uh statements made by the president other members ... that he had been burned down because a lot of them weren't factual here uh uh just Wednesday a couple of days ago former White House communications director\nShe called President Trump his man he advises a liar he then went on Bloomberg TV yesterday to clarify that what he meant was that the president was an intentional wire\nIs yes the president is speaking ms truth he asked the president is lying but he's doing it intentionally to incite surfing people which would include left leaning journalists and most of the left leaning politicians and so what is happening is\nThey come out like a hall monitor and the elementary school or junior high school and they say oh wow the president's lying and his face is basically laughing at him okay someone's taking your lunch money and the gap in Syria\nIf you call the hall monitor it's not going to help you okay you got to defeat the person at the table with your peer group\nSo Daniel Dale as ... compares sort of fact checkers people are doing real time ah verifying of information given to the public by their leaders at home monitors\nA recently also a trolley or worse old of a a buzzfeed posts a piece where he says look depresses participating in a cycle of of\nDisseminating missed truths or to the public even as doing fact checking here's what he says he says the the cycle feeds itself simply by virtue of the media reporting on the president\nTrump lives at a rally or by tweeter press conference the press reports that he lies Trump tells his supporters the media's unjustly attacking him his supporters believe that news organizations dinner perpetuating and feeling Trump's claims simply by amplifying and checking\nHis statements what do you make of that\nThere are a lot of thoughts there um I I think the problem is actually the opposite I still think there is insufficient\nFact checking in truth telling about the president's lies I don't think of his regularly the case that the media is is incessant is incessantly seizing on Trump's false statements at rallies or making a big deal about them and fueling\nA media hatred among Trump supporters I think many Trump supporters dislike the media for reasons entirely separate from the fact checking I think many of them are not reading are fact checking and I think the only alternative to\nUm to calling out the president for his lives is letting those lies stand unchallenged letting got information be widely disseminated without a U.S doing a a fundamental part of our job which is to give people accurate information so I Do think there was something to what Mr Scaramucci was saying in that\n\nSupport Ron voice comes from the listeners W.

I eat I don't cover the media but in the reporting that's been out there in our publication and in other news outlets um\nThe the head at NBC News and the lack held a town hall shortly thereafter those comments and said and really condemned those comments according to sources who were there and who told us another\nAnd other news outlets I think that says what the the news organizations you felt they had to do at this point\nUh I Want to thank you I Know some menu half\nSo the voice of sung Kim of the Washington Post thanks for having me I Want to take a couple of calls about making Kelly uh we've got a call from Tampa, Florida Carl go ahead\n[noise] um I Am as sensitive as anyone else or I'm ...\nI'm a black lab and I thank you for taking my call\nAnd I think that um sometimes on the on on the racial issue as we can go over the top [noise] uh I really don't think that there's anything that are like and how to Portland Dr phil [laughter] I come from a society which we have\nA class of ... well yeah I Do pay their faces and all types of laws not of any re issue connotation [laughter]\nIf you if you if you go on down the road then you go you're going to be able to do nothing is absolutely ridiculous I Wonder whether NBC had a lot a jet and got what they wanted to get through those up and use this as an excuse\nWell thank you so much for that call call call I appreciate it very much it's worth pointing out and perhaps not incidental that making Kelly's ratings were were not strong a and that her embrace by our colleagues even prior to this incident was not warm we've got another call on this subject from Omaha Nebraska rich go ahead\nI um yeah about Megan Kelly I I I think I I I'm not a fan of Megan Kelly I'm but you\nKnow in in hearing reports about how this all came about [noise] um I think uh we all make mistakes are especially on the air um and it's no different than a you know a story that comes out from the news service and they have to retract the story\nA she made a mistake she apologized or I don't think there was anything malicious about\nHer intent ah so I I really don't think uh they have taken the right course of action I'm\n... I'm very much appreciate your input on that rich important here thank you so much a Jack Beatty you know obviously the question of blackface plays into a\nA you know a rich and very painful history of the way in which white says I not only treated blacks or over the decades and centuries but how they've depicted them\nAt the same time making Kelly said she was unaware of the full scope of that history and her apology how does the decision of NBC to essentially a park with her I sit with you\n[noise] well it's not so much how it sits with me it's how it sits with the American public a in a massive study called hidden tried to sell you Americans polarize landscape just recently released\nA group called more in common they they interview the fold eight thousand people they had our long interviews focus groups et cetera et cetera on the question of political correctness and bite eighty percent\nOf Americans of all stripes say it is a problem in the country ah three that includes three quarters of African Americans includes Seventy nine percent of young people where you tend to think political correctness\nIs right the only group in the in the tribes of America as a divided here\nThat thinks political correctness understood however you want to put it a is a good thing by a majority are eight percent of the population and these are defined as progressive activists they are very affluent they have a very white\nAnd they are awesome highly educated but they're all by themselves and that's what he called the study calls them team walk\nThat's not what the what the whole American public feels they don't like political correctness on the other hand eighty two\nShe is a problem so the American public doesn't like political correctness I'm not saying that this was an example of it but it will be called that and they don't like a hate speech either\nThen you'll deal you know it's interesting we we heard a lot about political correctness on the campaign trail back in twenty sixteen and it seems like it's popped up in some races maybe a quarter Stewart does underdog race in Virginia against a democratic Senator Tim Kaine how much is a\nOur racial resentments and how much is the question of political correctness of influencing some of the uh the political races you're you're tracking around the country\nI think it is having a significant impact or at least Republicans are trying to make it have a significant impact in quite a number of house races the the course Stewart Senate race in Virginia as an obvious example um you know he is wrapped himself in the ... Confederate flag almost literally Mr Stewart I'm but I think you know perhaps even more interesting is the the more subtle\nUh efforts that a Republican superPACs and candidates are trying to make in various races they are in several cases trying to tie their democratic opponents to terrorism I'm In one case a there are in in New York state they are emphasizing the fact that a Rhodes Scholar who's running for the Democrats\nUm was once a rapper uh who use profanity in his in his political music um and and so these I think are quite an subtle\nAppeals to bigotry or or generously racial resentment um and it's either that they feel that this is a a compelling message to many voters or that this is their best message I'm In a in a very challenging for them\nAnd they'll get their most have been questions of whether race informs some of the arguments we've heard about of of voting rights and voter access during this election season a subject we've covered on this show but nonetheless one that keeps having new fresh fresh uh revelations every every day or so\nI think about the Georgia race how does race in form\nA or what's happening governor's race what's happening in terms of voting rights there\nWell I think great race is a huge factor as it often is in southern racism and many other races um you know we have a a a female African American candidate running for the Democrats yes we have a a white male candidate running for the Republicans the white male ... also happens to be the secretary of state of the state I'm basically in charge of\nElection issues uh and as usual we found that many of the people who are being a you know drop from the rolls or otherwise being blocked or discouraged from voting are disproportionately numbers of minorities particularly African Americans\nAnd so in in multiple ways it is impossible to separate race from from that George gubernatorial race\nOr one of the issues that the administration is felt very uncomfortable about in recent days involves the question of the ... murder or the death any way of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal ...

radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string obituary for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon do pose the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a cheap to pose a youth are called this one of the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have the department of health right we're either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide it's the number one source of accidental death in our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with is that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs there are medicines that inter\nBody for heroin and fact and all other don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said even orphan methadone there's a lot of stigma around um\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable another won't won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower mortality rate we could take a deep breath and we could move forward so [noise]\nAh with the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to uh get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at our needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment what you wanted to try some of the medication\nOr you'll get a prescription for it and the prescription is written by a doctor or a doctor who lost his son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose instead of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a prescription for buprenorphine\nAnd the Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot and we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place\nThat mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner or in our prison system who needs it and I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post incarcerate of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of the twelve percent ... percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things ah and hopefully they'll turn the tide\nUm kitten O'Neill with this of helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean\nI Believe that would ... then incarcerated multiple times and never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think Burlington is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issue so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now and we need to act\nOn that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue in a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an absence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm ... will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about abstinence base which is another way of describing some things like twelve step you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean 'cause in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to get them on a good path or it's it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know I'm brand and just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family when Matty was first starting to get clean had the idea well\nIf you're taking methadone or if you're taking the pornography and lay you're not really create clean you're not so far right and we just you know there's so much

reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um if you just look at the success rates if anybody's spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there's no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality is a losing\nProposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking a medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS

Gita a calling in from hartsville South Carolina thanks for joining us\nHi thank you for taking my call uh-huh\nWanted to hear a little bit I'm Sorry I just want to hear you or what your thoughts were about\nRecovering addict and I think an addict ever is here because I think for men were hard wired differently than normal people you know our one Tylenol may be good for somebody to five would be great for me um I went from\nI hated pain medicine until I had um oral surgery and they gave me opiates and all of a sudden I was in love I thought this was happening I had kidney stunts then they gave me I think drugs um and\nAnd that was even better I was like God have it on our you know and then they turn English back out into the prescription and then that's it you know and then you're you're out there on your on with your body meaning for more of what can't yet and you'll do just about anything you can to get what you need\nMhm thank you for that change that we've also call from Boston, Massachusetts Tom you're on the air go ahead\nHenry how you're doing okay I think your beliefs are cheap from Vermont is right on but I I got to tell you if the a drug company to providing the medicated assisted medication we're pushing that drug is hot as\nPurdue chemicals pushed the uh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem right now and because the medication does affect of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years\nAnd I've never seen anything like would have seen over the last ...\nYou know the the pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back from the pharmaceutical ...\nThere's a flooded throughout the addiction a heroin developed in Massachusetts anyway and so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people that are stabilized on a on a medication\nAnd then what happens is they are for off and then they relapse die because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat day to get a shot up front and all of a they get the uh the uh perk thirties that are that are really a crush fucking all and they get a couple of them and they guy now and my history I was incarcerated because of my opiates or the conduct\nAnd ah I relapsed that they are good old has that been read today I'd be dead because to twenty percent of the population that are exiting proven that have a addictive um or heroin or histories died within the first ah two weeks because of an overdose so\nWe're talking with Tom let me let me what the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing boost your personal experience and also your expertise on this but you don't want to let you weigh in on a couple of things first you've heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how they are a an active part of the solution\nConstructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not a currently part of the problem or how does that\nFit in with your reporting on this [noise] well um\nSits in in that um you know they just uh have plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make\nA difference in America they could do as chief don't pose a and others and some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose deaths rates by a very little bit\nAnd make it widely available one of the things I wanted to point out by what about the chief in what's happening in Vermont is that's really unusual I mean my ... is just off to him\nBut in states where uh we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently\nMean we have we have reached talking forgive you're talking about Medicaid expansion right yeah I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion I mean we have waiting lists that right\nT program we have no funneling from our ERs into MIT programs I'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange so nowhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails\nAnd um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live\nUh whether you get this lifesaving\nTreatment or not but we we have a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis reflection of American culture to disease of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans in your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the\nConstriction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in Appalachia or you know stretching from the you know the American\nSouth east up to the northeast uh in industries where they once could rely on steady jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is it that title sign was being\nPushed to ... what we really need our policies to address the root causes which are mental health issues and so ... socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers asked them in middle school what do you want to be when he grows when you grow up\nAnd he says I Want to be a draw or she goes oh you want to be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around him in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard it's hard to central at ... all the always were prescribe three hundred six hundred percent that the\n... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nRecently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex is our said the U.S is starting to turn the corner on this epidemic or he cited figure showing a to point eight percent dip in over deaths from September twenty seventeenth of march twenty Eighteen\nTo provisional data from the CDC the seemingly relentless trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be benefiting in the right direction\nPlus telling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but the concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn the tide\nRendell pose a you know the number of Americans dying from opioids are related deaths appears to be a just under the number of Americans in total who died in the Vietnam War but it's the secretary right are we turning the corner of it on this well\nOf all there that's every year rights of the Vietnam War was the ten year war and to you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so I think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for\nAmerica to fix it spiritual ... before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we are being derelict in their duties and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders that want to wrestle with\nUnemployment and A People's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like marijuana burger here in Burlington or a a chief of police um you know get down to brass tacks there are things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and\nUh I'd like to think bad for being so candid about them as well I mean it's getting the right treatment out there it's getting medication to the people who need the medication the Twenty one day apps and in space detox is called the spin dry by a lot of the people addicted to opioids in Vermont because you just go for your Twenty one day ... and what it does is\nAnd then you just go quietly back to your home and you start using opioids again that is not about hope and despair in America that's about sound public health policies\n... can you just take one moment and describe for us what opioids just briefly what opioids due to the brain why are they so dangerous\nYeah so um once you get addicted to these drugs it's it's people I mean I watch over and over and my book people lose\nUm access to these lifesaving treatments and they are just not able to uh get better without the help of this medication assisted treatment because of\n\nMajor funding from point it's because I like Ike out offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are ... and providing twenty four sat

sending troops to the border to opening asylum laws\nWhere one hundred and four to three eight to five five that twenty eight hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nMy guests today are Daniel failed to Toronto Star strongman chemical Washington Post and of course our own news analyst shirt on point Jack Beatty or something or the president has talked a lot this week about the caravan of migrants wending its way about a thousand miles south of the U.S border\nIn Central America south of even of Mexico at this point ah\n[noise] that that is certainly gotten a lot of news coverage and it's a very real issue on the other hand I'm In the president's framing of it as part of a a a as an issue of vital national security concern is it the sense that there is something that the president needs to address on a federal level or their sense of distant turning attention maternal elections I think\nThat that I think he wants to make the sense that there that the government needs to take action but it is important to point out the facts here that this caravan while it is traveling we kept the latest an estimate from Mexican officials and that it is about more than nine hundred\nMiles south of the U.S Mexico border so it is still significantly far away um you know experts in the region and ... on the issue has said for a long time that these are people who are you know seek or who are fleeing from violence and\nTrying to find refuge in the United states and that\nYou know the vast majority of these are asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states\nUm I Do want to point out one use development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block on a you know people at the border who come here to seek asylum it's they're considering using kind of the same national\nSecurity rationale that they use to invoke the travel ban and the different generations the travel ban and the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final at a ration of that ban was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court\nAnd one option that the administration is now considering is doing that on the southern border um you know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBy the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers can go on and addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the president become more I'm more focused on in these last several days and weeks\nDuring a bill or our listeners may or may not know that I'm as well as reporting for\nThe star from Washington or you kind of bird dog the statements from the president from major officials are pretty much in real time in a rather extraordinary way\nI'm On Tuesday vice president Mike Pence bolstered the president's claim that there are unknown middle Easterners mixed in with Central American migrants moving toward the U.S border here's what the vice president had to say\nThe United states of America intervenes and prevents him terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable that there would not be individuals or from the middle east as a part of this growing the terror\nDaniel how accurate that the president and vice presidents from work's been in terms of characterizing what we know about that a caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in in like a logic class um you know he he was President Pence made his statement that is arguably factual this is based on department of homeland security statistics about people on terror walked those being prevented from entering the country and then made a completely unfounded link a leap\nFrom that to the care of and you know just because\nTen terrorists or suspected terrorists are a bunch of terrorists or prevented from entering the country um has no obvious a connection to people are trying to walk into the country from Honduras Guatemala\nUm and so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in the ministry shouldn't\nUm has made logical leaves and completely baseless claims about this caravan but that have no granting it ... in reality at all\n[noise] Chuck Beatty is there nothing to the idea that that we should be concerned about the the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise a number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum\nCertainly should be concerned about it but we should be concerned under the age of civil law laws which involve the right to seek asylum in the United states\nYou know what's going on here is the politics of fear of which Mr Trump is a master during the two thousand campaign he let it out is it real power is I don't want to use the word see here he's playing on fear\nA fear of the nation under attack by brown skinned people coming up from the south\nAnd reporters have talked to people as far north as Minnesota who's an interview with the times with a woman in Minnesota\n... come up here in Minnesota\nAnd to be going into the cabins that that people have a summer homes and in staying there for the winter and then when the people who ... who come in the summer they'll the the these these are these migrants will be living in their cabins course they'd have to walk a thousand miles to the border and then the Fifteen hundred miles to\nTo uh to Minnesota but this is this is what's here is the magnification of deep seated American anxieties especially among conservatives about keeping the country you know ...\nWe've got a call from El Paso Texas John is calling a John my understand if you do some work down there that's related to this\nUh you do or they take my call we we work with a a little militia out here where mobilized and on the order to make sure that this caravan not make it into our country we're disgusted with what you people in the media have been doing a we're sick of your rhetoric at our president\nSo ah ... you actually to be honest you told their producers that your your uh uh trying to help well that's all right\nOh hey there's there there's a line that we're not going to happen not going to share what we do advocate has its good discourse back and forth and and uh just disagreement in a civil way but we're not we're not going to have people abusing each other on the air\nOr we are going to return however to one of the comments that uh that I Want to follow up with Daniel Dale of Toronto Star a and think about the question she flagged questions about uh statements made by the president other members ... that he'd been burned down because a lot of them weren't factual here uh uh just Wednesday a couple of days ago\nFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci went on the air or and she called President Trump his man he advises a liar he then went on Bloomberg TV yesterday to clarify that what he meant was that the president was an intentional liar\nYes the president is speaking ms true see as the president is lying what he's doing it intentionally to incite surfing people which would include left leaning journalists and most of the left leaning politicians and so whereas a happening is\nThey come out like a hall monitor and the elementary school or junior high school and they said oh wow the president's lying and his face is basically laughing at 'em okay if someone's taking your lunch money in the cafeteria\nIf you call the hall monitor it's not going to help you okay you got to defeat the person at the table with your roof\nSo Daniel Dale as ... a compares a sort of fact checkers people are doing real time ah verifying of information given to the public by their leaders as ...\nI'm a recently also a trolley or worse old of a a buzzfeed posts peace where he says look depresses participating in a cycle of a disseminating missed truths or to the public even as doing fact checking here's what he says he says that the cycle feeds itself simply by virtue of the media reporting on the president\nTrump lives at a rally or by tweeter press conference the press reports that he lies Trump tells his supporters the media's unjustly attacking him his supporters believe that news organizations dinner perpetuating and feeling Trump's claims simply by amplifying and checking his statements what do you make of that\nThere are a lot of thoughts there um I I think the problem is actually the opposite I still think there was insufficient\nFact checking in truth telling about the president's lies I don't think it has regularly the case that the media is is incessant is incessantly seizing on Trump's false statements at rallies\nOr making a big deal about them and fueling a media hatred among Trump supporters I think many Trump supporters dislike the media for reasons entirely separate from the fact checking I think many of them are not reading are fact checking and I think the only alternative to\nUm to calling out the president for his lives is letting those lies stand on\nSlash the ... that's the public's radio dot ORG slash the ...\nSupport for on point comes from the listeners of W.

I you know I don't cover the media but in the reporting that's been out there in our publication and in other news outlets on\nThat the head at NBC News Andy lack held a town hall shortly thereafter those comments and sad and really condemned those comments according to sources who were there and who told us another\nAnd other news outlets I think that says why they did use Organisation just thought they had to do at this point\nUh I Want to thank you I Know some men you have to dash uncover a few days to thank you for joining us that's the voice of sung Kim of the Washington Post thanks for having me I Want to take a couple of calls about making Kelly uh we've got a call from Tampa, Florida Carl go ahead\nI'm I Am as sensitive as anyone else or I'm ...\nI'm a black guy do for the call\nAnd I think that um sometimes on the on on the racial issues we can go over the top uh I really don't think that there's anything that are like and you have to apologize I come from a society which we have\nA class of ... well yeah I Do a little ... their faces and all types of laws not of any re shoe connotation\nIf you if you if you go on that road that you go you're going to be able to do nothing is absolutely ridiculous I ... I'm Wondering whether NBC had another gender whether they want you to get through to use this as an excuse\nWell thank you so much for that call call call I appreciate it very much it's worth pointing out and perhaps not incidental that making Kelly's ratings were were not strong a and that her embrace by our colleagues even prior to this incident was not warm we've got another call on this subject from Omaha Nebraska rich go ahead\n\nI um yeah about Megan Kelly I I I think I I I'm not a fan of Megan Kelly I'm but you know in in hearing reports about how this all came about\nUm I think uh we all make mistakes uh especially on the air um and it's no different than a you know a story that comes out from the news service and they have to retract a story\nOr she made a mistake she apologized or I don't think there was anything malicious about\nHer intent uh so I really don't think uh they have taken the right course of action um\nWell I I very much appreciate your input on that rich important here thank you so much a Jack Beatty you know obviously the question of black please please into a a you know a rich and very painful history of the way in which the\nDecades and centuries but how they've depicted them at the same time Megan Kelly said she was unaware of the full scope of that history and her apology how does the decision of NBC to essentially a park with her uh sit with you\n[noise] well it's not so much how it sits with me is how it sits with the American public a in a massive study called hidden tribes the study of America's polarize landscape just recently released\nA group called more in common they\nThey interview the fold eight thousand people they had our long interviews focus groups et cetera et cetera on the question of political correctness and bite eighty percent\nOf Americans of all stripes say it it is a problem in the country ah three that includes three quarters of African Americans includes Seventy nine percent of young people where you tend to think political correctness\nIs rife the only group in the in the tribes of America as a divided here that thinks political correctness understood however you want to put it\nA is a good thing by a majority are eight percent of the population and these are defined as progressive activists they are very affluent they have a very white\nAnd they are often highly educated but they're all by themselves and that's what he ... he decided he calls them team walk\nThat's not what the what the whole American public feels they don't like political correctness on the other hand eighty two percent of Americans think hate speech is a problem so the American public doesn't like political correctness I'm not saying that this was an example of it but it will be called that and they don't like\nA hate speech either\nDaniel daily you know it's interesting we we heard a lot about political correctness on the campaign trail back in twenty sixteen and it seems like it's popped up in some races maybe a quarter Stewart does the underdog race in Virginia against a democratic senator\nTim Kaine how much is a our racial resentments and how much is the question of political correctness of influencing some of the uh the political races you're you're tracking around the country\nI think it is having a significant impact or at least Republicans are trying to make it have a significant impact in quite a number of house races the the course Stewart Senate race in Virginia is an obvious example um you know he is wrapped himself in the ... Confederate flag almost literally Mr Stewart I'm but I think you know perhaps even more interesting is the the more subtle\nUh efforts that a Republican superPAC some candidates are trying to make in various races um they are in several cases trying to tie their democratic opponents to terrorism I'm In one case a there are in in New York state they are emphasizing the fact that a Rhodes Scholar who's running for the Democrats\nUm was once a rapper who use profanity in his in his political music um and and so these I think are quite an subtle\nAppeals to bigotry or were generously racial resentment um and it's either that they feel that this is a a compelling message to many voters or that this is their best message I'm In a in a very challenging for them\nAnd then you'll be out there there are also been questions of whether race informs some of the arguments we've heard about of of voting rights and voter access a during this election season a subject we've covered on this show but nonetheless one that keeps having new fresh a fresh revelations every every day or so\nI think about the Georgia race how does race in form\nA or what's happening governor's race what's happening in terms of voting rights there\nI think great races a huge factor as it often is in southern racism and many other races um you know we have a a a female African American candidate running from the Democrats yes we have a a white male candidate running for the Republicans\nSecretary of state of the state I'm basically in charge of\nElection issues uh and as usual we found that many of the people who are being a you know drop from the rules or otherwise being blocked or discouraged from voting are disproportionately members of minorities particularly African Americans\nAnd so in in multiple ways it is impossible to separate race from from that torture gubernatorial race\nOr one of the issues that the administration is felt very uncomfortable about in recent days involves the question of the ... murder or the death any way of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal ...
