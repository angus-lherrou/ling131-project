one point radio dot org rabbi rent and burg welcome to the program\nI magna so you're first thoughts today on um how ... how we should be looking at and thinking about what happened on Saturday a tree of life\nI we need to be seeing it in context um when Trump is saying this is so hard to believe and I think this is absolutely devastating a but it's absolutely conceivable given the context of\nAnti Semitism historically and on the rise and America given the context that our lack of protections for gun violence\nGet in the context of ongoing tree thing hate crimes in America and the rise of white supremacy\nI'm this absolutely is\nA ... if it said that a lot of contacts and and I argued in the piece that it also sits in the context unfortunately of our history of of murders in Judaism\nMm Mm I should note here that we've got a couple of comments that are coming online Nancy banks tells us on Facebook that while I Do not in any way wish to diminish the horror of the killings in Pittsburgh to black men were also murdered last week or possibly a hate crime a lot of heat for one week\nAnd in fact a genetic these point that shooter was ... who had who could gunned down those two black men in Kentucky said that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I\nThe ... anti Semitism but also in the broader context of\nA as I keep calling this ecosystem of hate here but the a rabbi written bird tell me a little bit more about um you know how is that we should look to or what exactly you see in American plead political leadership right now that maybe that maybe stoking all of this\nI there is a tremendous amount ... we have a a white supremacist administration and Trump has been in self attacking George Soros for\nLong long time he's been using even after the tree of life shooting he's been making use of the global asked what she does very very often thought that these are\nNew contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles a the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and I'd front and secretly hot you know funding infiltration is uh is is a very very very ancient idea\nUm but it's it manifesting now in a in a myriad of ways\nMm [noise] well I mean Howard framing of let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um that the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA was really ... renting and railing about online I mean ah you know he talked a lot about a ... his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest right that that originally began and I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading organization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees ... talk and then there was a conspiracy behind that as well so hard just talk to me more about about how those threats come together\nWell ah this isn't the story just about the Jews are just about the tree of life a synagogue or where I basically grew up [noise]\nIf you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine of social and political ah disarray and and and and break down\nAnd and I think you need to look at it in that context of\nThe first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston were quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers on this case in the church\nA fed by a lot of the same\nParanoia and an anger and and and\nConspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I I look at it uh over the course of history\nAh conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a it convenient and deadly a answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged and and and angry at the system\nUh it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years\nAnd here in America it as part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum\nOr we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing religiously motivated paranoia we're we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia\nAnd and the language has gotten a harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the some of the language that the the Democrats have used to have to lean toward\nBuddy is or who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\nWhat the point we've reached here and there are a lot of reasons for their lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically\nOr is it subhuman is not quite human is is an other with a capital oh that is dangerous in in ... and out to destroy society uh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system\nWanted contention but they relied on the idea that there would be character and the people that they were to be communities communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with them politically and and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing out\nOf our sort of culture is what's allowed this to happen it's what's allowed\nUm the shooting in Charleston to happen it's it's what's allowed people to send pipe bombs to democratic leaders which is what led a Mr powers to uh to say I'm going in and head into a a a building that I Know all too well where my parents\nBoth taught Sunday school arose permits food\nUm and and the scenes of mayhem there just to be able to manage and he says that it's all part of this larger context of the hollowing out of our civic life\nCan I can see that go ahead I'm [noise] I think this both sides rhetoric is not helpful\nIn this moment and I think that's a obfuscate the context in which a group of people have power and are stoking hate and our fostering the humanizing language\nAnd are putting separating families putting children in cages creating Muslim bans removing a transgender ah folks access to to legal protection\nI'm a ...

things that you had said and I wanted to give you a chance to respond [noise]\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law it's getting into his daughter and son in law\nIs ridiculous it's like saying that he couldn't possibly be in the ... because he's had three lives as somebody observed on Twitter right [laughter]\nThe idea that that he somehow or you know all dissolved of his life supremacist stoking of his blaming the the caravan on Soros\nOf his constant attacks on source calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally\nUm that he uses the word globalized again and again and again but somehow he's auto magically freed from from connection because of his daughters decisions if not resonate with me\nThe idea that George Soros is somehow this um you know it was involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked and SARS themself\nAddressed it

stranger because we were\nOn citizen the the immigrant among us and I I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to ... to paint us as I'm having some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are are just part of a larger like right\nKind of measure yeah is that where it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I I'm definitely ... but I also just want to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because I Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know\nTo bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront had on this ecosystem that is being um if not birds end at least a I don't I don't know legitimize or not it's tamped down by a Republican leadership in America right now\nCan I speak to that because I've been covering them\nFor years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo no I uh to to to take it ... through the eyes of showroom if I can for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews overhead is utterly\nWrong or and here's the reason\nUh for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states or we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth and what's best in us to be not only president but but evident\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one is written out of the story on the theory that they're not human\nAnd and what Donald Trump has done is that he has taken every thread\nOf discord cynicism hatred and fear that has always been residents in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about\nThe Native Americans et cetera he's he's gathered every one of those bloody threads in his hands and rhetorically is used them to get elected\nAnd is using them to govern\nI'd I don't you like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and and propaganda but the truth is that he rose to power on fear the rose to power on fear of the other or whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he has an on\nUnbelievable gift for gathering those threads together and rhetorically using them to gain power\nAnd that is a scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country and that that's the concern right and there's no doubt that he's weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that were in\nSo she has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states he has the most powerful a and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet warning\nOr that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quit buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August\nAfter visiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about or that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anti immigration stances\nUm and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the is this party where in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republican\nAnd we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that ... may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protested against judge Kavanaugh us\nBut all of these things together to me seems to be I don't know is it just you know political cynicism of using these conspiracy theories some of it is true belief\nBut that this is this ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be an outcome of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case uh Howard let me just turn back to you and what do we do about it I mean we even have Lou\nDobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYeah I heard that comment about the SARS occupied State Department I think the only answer is leadership\nIts voting as David Was saying a lot of people have to get out and ... and and express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty\nTwenty election so voters have to an individual says to the individual by individual voting it also has to be leaders we have a paradoxical system here in the sense that it's of the people by the people for the people are as from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character\nAnd and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it\nFrom from somebody ah from people who come forward as leaders to to explain that America is a community and uh we're individuals and we'd prize individual wisdom in America that are also community and we can't operate without that\nSo it's going to take leaders to come forward to to convince Americans as a whole that there's an answer to using fear and hatred is a way to gain power uh there's there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nRight well rather rent Bergen David should have been I Know you want to get a word in here but I Do have to make some space for our callers who've been patiently waiting so let me just go briefly to Lois who's calling from Northampton, Massachusetts lowest you're on the air\nHello thank you for taking my call I'm voting I don't know about leadership um education to talk of a Jew\nAs a conspirator somebody as they shouldn't hand\nDirecting things manipulating things from behind the scenes\nThis has been a staple it's absolutely central to modern anti Semitism since at least the late Nineteen century there's absolutely no question when a Soros and others are vilified\nSecondly I think the issues of the president having Jewish members of his family or his support for the current government of Israel's policies those are entirely separate issues\nThis is the public radio eighty nine forty three ...\n\nMajor funding for on point is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance through the Geico insurance agency additional information can be found at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nFrom WVU are Boston and NPR I make the chalk liberty this is on point the one thing everyone agrees on these midterm elections are critically important they'll set the tone for the second half\nOf President Trump's term they'll determined gubernatorial leadership in several key states\nWe're seeing unprecedented turnout for early voting just mid term money is pouring into campaign and superPAC offers advise our bullets in your airwaves so we'll check in with analysts and reporters on the ground on what's playing out on the campaign trail in the final push before next Tuesday\nNext on point what to watch a week and a day away from the ...\n\n[noise] hello I'm are in motion the b._b._c.

the ground from Democrats\nHere but um do they have the momentum on their side or have things been shifting in recent days here and they let me to start with you what what do you see\nWell you know I've always kind of looked at these midterm elections as a true America is because when we're talking about a blue waves and sue nominees and any other way whether metaphor though you might be hearing it really doesn't apply to the Senate or the Senate map\nHas always kind of been in favor of Republicans meaning there are more Democratic senators up for reelection more of them in red states\nYou know in the in the bottom line I think that Republicans are most likely to maintain control the Senate and maybe even gain seats in the Senate and I could see the president sort of grasping matters as a new book the red waiver materialized when really we kind of saying this for months\nBut the house with a completely different story and then it's it's a different America different battlefield where Democrats don't have to win in deep red Republican territory and I think that's the houses were Democrats can make big games and I think at this point are still most likely to regain the majority\nHuh Interesting Jennifer ... are you seeing something similar out there\nI Am and ... on the question of enthusiasm I mean really I think everybody's totally a revved up and ready to vote 'em and a lot of places they already are voting big um turnout in early voting in states that have it already\nUm for a long time that Democrats had a big enthusiasm advantage because I'm voters and people who hadn't previously been involved in politics got very\nUh fired up by Trump's election and so there's been in our polling at the journal and elsewhere big enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans\nBut over the last month to six weeks that's really um that that gap has diminished as Republicans have really gotten much more engaged\n[noise] support for on point comes from WB or Boston and oddly

Michigan get you're on the air\nFor having me on back now I think you are a panel for taking time from each day and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what threat for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nYou know our neighbor one of the counties that Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to um\nOne thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be this consensus of white\nIs Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously this is a heavy manufacturing state\nThis is a state that kinda gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump had gone through the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so just as a progressive guy who was an office there but I Want to ask you this question and in terms of you know what does\nPotentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a blue wave coming in a what the impact and what that leads on the state and local levels here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party and Michigan at twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that lived over a there's a proposal ballot here that will potentially\nUm you know changed the district of the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats I guess in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very\nPerplexing yeah eight which you know not many people seem to you know talk about when it comes to a battleground\nState Garrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there's one state of consequences that that seems poised to have a blue wave it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which were Widmer it seems to have a pretty sizable\nUm stance leading the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the um incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is Marge and it was such a narrow margin that it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm\nUp against President Trump and twenty twenty\nYeah and then as Garrett was asking uh it seems that question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are we going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy in the next two years and how that might that have an impact on a ... on on Michigan on on Michigan Michigan\nWorkers well it depends a lot on what happens with the terrorists that he's proposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertainty and he alternates between a talking about imposing more and more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it\nProbably um help stabilize the the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement but um if there's one thing about Donald Trump and his policy that's safe to say it's a kind of don't know what's next\nOr or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think if it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of if something's not working you can just turn to do one eighty into All right we're going to we're going to do something else and when it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race\nDemocratic nominee and what is it the contrast between approaches and styles and and their view on the economy as well as how people feel like the the country's headed and the right direction when we get that far\nRight you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races a happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling shows how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there's also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we couldn't be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counts and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election day\nOkay so this is then one of the reasons why I'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become a such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian ... is the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we're going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a refuting a Brian camps that statement that he has not suppressed voters a secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rules\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot he raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of suppression feed the narrative because that hurts oppression and only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes won't kept well\nAt that gubernatorial debate Republican candidate secretary of state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from ... rooms extreme agenda that she has for\nGovernment takeover of healthcare wanting to get a scholarship to those that are here illegally in many many other radicalization\nAs current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp Steven Fowler ... give us take a minute here to walk us through this controversy in Georgia what exactly has happened with voter rolls in Georgia and how important of an issue has become in the last week of uh of campaigning before the election\nSo the two candidates we have here really are diametrically opposed ends of voting rights and voting access secretary of state camp has done a lot to clean up the roles some people say purge the roles of removing people voting there's also a record number of Georgians registered as of yesterday it was six point nine million people\nAnd the early voting numbers are higher than they've ever been before the twenty fourteen midterms were at one point one million people that have cast a ballot early as opposed to about four hundred thousand and twenty fourteen\nBut on the other hand Stacey Abrams has dedicated a lot of her political career to getting more people to vote getting minorities to vote getting younger people to vote who haven't done and so the two have clashed over the years and it's complicated in this gubernatorial race and\nSlashed the Bible or\n\nSupport for on point comes from

and it it's just so utterly ridiculous to hear these claims that these GOP lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions when their votes have said just the opposite\nAnd I know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election\nBut I mean you have the you have to be\n[noise] are attacking people with preexisting condition [noise]\nLeo thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what we said well if a\nNation was right in talking about how central the issue health care issue is for the Democrats and if every wondered whether or not it was an important and winning issue there's nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue\nUm in past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there's one issue that has really broad residents for people it's the protections for people with preexisting condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided yeah so the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seem to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races across the country let's go to Nevada here where it in a debate between the candidates for Senate in Nevada\nUh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there and you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen\nA asking senator Heller to tell in Nevada family and their son whose name was dean why Heller quote broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nYou promise and protect their health care and that you would protect our protections from Faye fishing conditions\nAnd then you went back to Washington\nAnd you for your promise to cave\nSo I Want to tell you what can the camera there watching tonight\nAnd what they want me to asking us to look them in the eye\nReally tell them the truth\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nYou can say turn turn your considered under which are you concerned at a thousand times it's just not true I wrote I wrote the replacement bill for the Republican Party I Know exactly what's in the villages that bill includes\nPre existing conditions how shall I say well we'll talk in the eye and tell them to try and survive\nThat's at a debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Meghan Mr Lee she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't play radio dot org\nMaking welcome to the program Hi thanks for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race between senator Heller and representative Rosen\nAs you just heard during that back but it's been a huge focal point of the race um you know like like you all are talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic or a first term congresswoman has been\nReally making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to the fact that there was this sort of now in the press conference that happened last summer where a Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressing concern about\nThe first repeal it or ... wrote healing replaced proposal that than Republicans have brought forward but then he ended up actually voting in favor of as you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the the repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she has run\nThe Affordable CARE Act she has this as sort of memorable ad attacking Heller as senator spineless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of sort of blowing in the wind when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act stay with it but it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the polls in this late stage telling you\nWrite that this race is still really close and you know if you listen to folk talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into this\nCycle you know the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing re election on you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the bowls and the most of them within the margin of error so you know everyone is expecting this to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wires I think\nYou know the big question and and what remains to be seeing as how this message resonates with Nevada's nonpartisan are independent voters here um you know whether they do how the significant concerns about health care and and from what we've seen health care really is a top issue for voters here in Nevada and like oh\nWell a nation Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking somewhat vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nWell I think I'm One of the reasons why the Republicans have a chance to gain seats which I'm not convinced the detail is going to lose you begin your book for much of a cycle and I really you know we had it as a toss we I think we've and it's a toss up for the whole\nThe whole reason we're we're probably keep it there but in in the back of my mind like you know I think he's still going to I think it's going to lose and so that matters to mouth but if he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to Jeff which open seat in Arizona\nThen you know that increases their ability to actually gain seats but no matter has been interesting in ... Nevada independent from Megan in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone which which struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected\nYou just like well it's a Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two\nCompetitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending or Jackie rations third district and the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy to move and money and they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think were this was mid term that enough presidential in mid term Nevada tends to be more Republican\n... what do you think about that\nI think that's that's exactly right and that's one of the interesting things we can sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen which we saw\nA complete red weigh ins in Nevada and Republicans swept at\nYou know controlled all of the state's constitutional officers of the legislature on the competitive house seat I truly was you know a red wave um which which stands in such a stark contrast to what happens in twenty sixteen um but but that point is exactly right you know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well\nDuring the term elections and that's really going to ... come down to you know\nAll that effort they are putting in with their ground game to try and get folks to turn out with the help of the powerful coronary union here um which is part of what's known as the Reid machine are started by you know obviously former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid um you know under his his tenure\nAt the big question is ten ten Democrat you know make this look a little bit more like a presidential year as opposed to to image ... mid term you're in which they they traditionally don't fare as well\nMid term any state might be different than president the the ... state in the presidential year but one question for you making I mean here we are just a week to go before the midterms and I heard you say that you know obviously there's a lot of question around whether what direction certain voters might go independent voters in Nevada et cetera but\nHow much uh is the uncertainty right now is it is it that like are there are people still out there making up their minds based on certain issues or maybe last minute campaign stops or is it simply a get out the vote question now because I'm just like who out there still doesn't know how they're going to vote in Nevada\n\nMajor funding from

justice leaders her opinion piece for the Washington Post is headlined the victims of the tree of life synagogue massacre\nRabbi rent and burg welcome to the program high magna\nSo you're first thoughts today on um how how we should be looking at and thinking about what happened on Saturday a tree of life\nWe need to be seeing it in context\nUm when Trump is saying this is so hard to believe and I think this is absolutely devastating a but it's absolutely conceivable get in the context of anti Semitism historically and on the rise in America given the context of our lack of protections for gun violence\nGet in the context of ongoing tree thing hate crimes in America and the rise of white supremacy\nI'm this absolutely is\nA ... if it fits it a lot of contacts and and I argue in the piece that it offers sits in the context unfortunately of our history of of murders a in Judaism\n... ... I should note here that we've got a couple of comments that are coming online Nancy banks tells us on Facebook that while I Do not in any way wish to diminish the horror of the killings in Pittsburgh to black men were also murdered last week or possibly a hate crime a lot of heat for one week\nAnd in fact a genetic these point that shooter was ... who had gone down those two black men in Kentucky said that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I'm trying to want to talk specifically about rising and anti Semitism but also in the broader context of\nA as I keep calling this ecosystem of hate here but but a rabbi written bird tell me a little bit more about um the you know how is that we should look to or what exactly you see in American plead political leadership right now that maybe the maybe stoking all of this\nI there is a tremendous amount student we have a a a white supremacist uh administrative action and Trump has been in self attacking George Soros\nFor a long long time he's been using even after the tree of life shooting he's been making use of the word globalized which he does very very often both of these are\nNew contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles a the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and an front and secretly hot you know funding infiltration is uh is is a very very very ancient idea um but it's it's manifesting\nNow in a in a myriad of ways\nMm [noise] well I mean Howard Berman a let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um the the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA was really ... renting and railing about on the line I mean ah you know he talked a lot about uh his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest right the that originally began as I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading\nOrganization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees talk and then there was a conspiracy behind that as well so hard just talk to me more about about how those threats come together\nWell or the Susan storage just above the Jews are just above the tree of lawyers\nGrew up [noise] if you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine of social and political ah disarray and\nAnd and and\nBreak down and and I think you need to look at it in that context of the first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston were quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers on this case in a church\nI'm fed by a lot of the same\nParanoia and and anger and and and\nConspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I I look at it uh over the course of history\nAh conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a it convenient and deadly a answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged in in an angry at the system\nAh it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years\nAnd here in America is part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum\nOr we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing a religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia\nAnd and the language has gotten a harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the some of the language that uh that Democrats have used to have\nHave have lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is or who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\nWhat the point we've reached here\nOr there are a lot of reasons for it there are lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically or is it subhuman is not quite human is is an other with a capital of that is dangerous in in comprehensible and out to destroy society\nUh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system\nWanted contention but they relied on the idea that there would be character and the people that there were ... communities communities where people would know each other and us

and head into a a a building that I Know all too well where my parents\nBoth taught Sunday school where I was bar mitzvahed\nUm and and the scenes of mayhem there are just a beyond imagining but it it's all part of this larger context of the hollowing out of our civic life\nKinda yeah go ahead [noise]\nI think both sides rhetoric is not helpful in this moment I think yeah I think the context in

Daniel written bird and rubber ... just before the break we have that color or shalom who was taking issue with some things that you had said and I wanted to give you a chance to respond [noise]\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law is getting a Jewish daughter not Jewish son in law\nIs ridiculous it's like saying that he couldn't possibly be in a Sachin is because he's had three lives and some except on Twitter right the idea that that somehow all dissolved of his white supremacist\nGang of his blaming the the caravan on Soros\nOf his constant attacks on SARS calling you know\nSally [noise] um that he uses the word globalized again and again and again that somehow he's auto magically freed from from connection because\nOf his daughters decisions not resonate with me the idea that George Soros\nIs somehow this um you know is involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked and SARS himself addressed it in an interview it's not the fourteen year old in Hungary\nUh when the Nazis were there um\nYeah I I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump mindset I Will say that very clearly the Torah commands us again and again and again to protect the\nStranger who is among us the vulnerable and their commended thirty six times more than any other myths that in the Tara to protect the stranger because we were ...\nConfidence and the the immigrant among us and I I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to ... to paint us as I'm\nHaving some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are just part of ...\nRight yeah it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I I definitely under ... but I also just want to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because I I Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know I I\nI take the point that there are lots of bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront had on\nThis ecosystem that as being um if not\nBurdened at least a ... I don't I don't know legitimize or not to tamp down by a Republican leadership in America right now can I speak to that because I've been covering them for years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo no I uh to to to take it through through the eyes of showroom if I can for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews overhead\nIs utterly wrong or and here's the reason uh for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states\nOr we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth and what's best in us to be not only president but but evident and and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one is written out of the story on the theory that they're not human\nAnd and what Donald Trump has done is that he is taken every thread of discord cynicism hatred in\nFear that has always been resident in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about the Native Americans as senator he's he's gathered every one of those bloody threads in his hands and rhetorically is used them to get elected\nAnd is using them to govern\nI'd I don't you like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and and propaganda but the truth is\nThat he rose to power on fear the rose to power on fear of the other or whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he hasn't on unbelievable gift for gathering those threats\nPower and that is a scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country and that that's the concern right and there's no doubt that he's weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that we're in\nRight I mean so she has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states he has the most powerful a and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet warning\nOr that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quote buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August after\nVisiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about uh that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anti immigration stances\nUm and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the is this party where in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republican\nAnd we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that ... may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protested against judge Kavanaugh silly all of these are actually say justice Kavanaugh now but all of these things together to me seems to be I don't know it it it just you know political cynicism of using these conspiracy theories some of it is true belief\nBut that this is this ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump maybe an hour come of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case uh Howard let me just turn back to you on the what do we do about it I mean we even have\nLou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYou know I heard that comment about the SARS occupied State Department I think the only answer is leadership\nIs voting as David Was saying uh with uh people have to get out in the in in an express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to an individual says to the individual by individual voting it also has to be leaders we have a paradoxical system here in the sense that it's of the people by other people for the people are as from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need\nLeaders of conscience and character and and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it\nFrom from somebody ah from people who come forward as leaders to to explain that America is a community and uh we're individuals and we'd prize individual ism in America ... per also community and we can't operate without that\nSo it's going to take leaders to come forward to to convince Americans as a whole that there is an answer to using\nFear and hatred is a way to gain power uh there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nRight well rabbi ... David trip and I know you want to get a word in here but I Do have to make some space for our callers who've been patiently waiting so let me just go briefly to Lois who's calling from Northampton, Massachusetts lowest you're on the air\nHello thank you for taking my call I'm voting I don't know about leadership um education to talk of a Jew\nAnd directing things manipulating things from behind the scenes this has been a staple with absolutely central to modern anti Semitism since at least the late Nineteen century there's absolutely no question when a Soros and others are vilified secondly\nI think the issues of of the president having Jewish members of his family or his support for the current government of Israel's policies those are entirely separate issues from the question of fomenting", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "29"}
