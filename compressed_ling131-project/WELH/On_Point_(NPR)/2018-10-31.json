the magical joy full energy of childhood is allowed to roam grow and explore unfettered\nNo rules and no requirements know boring routines that can kill a child's love of learning let's call them on schooling kind of like a super size Montessori where kids have a one hundred percent control over what they do even if it's something that looks one hundred percent\nNot like learning organic gardening or building rockets or just watching TV whatever it is one hundred percent the child's choice but is it a good choice this hour\nOn point getting schools on the on schooling movement and you can join us do you have experience with an schooling\nWhat does it look like for you as a parent what was it like as a kid why do you do it does it work and and then there's this what about all those things a typical schools offer socialization exposure to new ideas and subject even if a kid isn't interested at first\nWith all that and can you get that in\nAn schooling where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also join us anytime it on point radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook and on point radio\nAnd before we START I just want to give it to the to the Boston Globe magazine they recently wrote a piece about an schooling where the inspiration for this hour came from the author that piece of fortunately was unable to join us today but we've got a link to the globe story at some point radio dot org do check it out well\nJoining me first today from Philadelphia is mostly to dig she on schools hurt eleven and Thirteen year old daughter's\nNeither of whom have ever attended a brick and mortar school\nShe's also the founder of eclectic learning network a secular black and brown centered home education network will lead to dig welcome to on point\nOh thank you magnify thank you so much for having me today\nIt's great to have you so so first of all walk us through a typical day for your daughter's what does ... what do they do when they're being an schooled\nFor me the the short answer is everything and nothing um\nEvery day has a different one and for for our family an schooling or self directed learning is something that we've embraced over the years and it allows them the freedom to be able to explore ideas thoughts\nOr whether it be read a book or maybe start off and kick off today watching television either way it's their decision and my focus becomes to guide them through whatever decisions that they make to ensure that their experiences as fruitful as they would like to be\nYeah so I think that sounds a quite revolutionary and at least very unfamiliar to a lot of people who might be listening so I mean if you could just sort of take us down to the level of what you do starting in the morning when when your girls wake up how does the un schooling they began\nIt it totally begins with freedom I mean they are morning or they are mourning folks I Am not\nA at eleven and Thirteen they are able to prepare their own food so you don't have to have that stick of oh let me get up and cook breakfast for my daughter's this morning that's not our case um so the beginning

they learn it and I'm joined today by ... she's a mother who an schools were eleven and Thirteen year old daughter she's founder of eclectic learning network and she's joining us today from Philadelphia also with us is Peter gray he is a professor of psychology at Boston College cofounder\nAnd president of the nonprofit alliance for self directed education and the author of free to learn\nA no ... I I still have some sort of basic questions about how a an schooling or self directed learning really work because it seems as if it requires or perhaps a success is based on how self directed a child is\nAnd um you know I'm Wondering what about all those kids who if they are really given the choice to do anything they want all day long would just up to turn on the TV and sit there for eight hours\nRight well you know the kids that we see who uh sit there for eight hours turning on the TV are largely kids who are going to public school they're coming home and sit and watch a TV right [laughter] so\nThis issue of self directed what does it mean to be self directed um [noise]\nI uh I'm an evolutionary psychologist so I'm interested in human nature and the nature of children [noise]\nLook at little kids have you ever see a little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious playful and eagerly doing things they're exploring the world almost from the moment they're born there looking around what's out there what's new what can I learn about [noise]\nThink of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school\nAnd this is not this is not just some children that learn it this is essentially all the children they learn their native language from scratch\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them\nSo on schooling is this what if we just left them continue to do that instead of putting them away where their own questions don't count anymore where their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another or to cooperate people talk about socialization being missing if you're not going to school what kinds of social\nSend them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because\nWe've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity playfulness because they have the ability to something here\nFor a second I thought I had read that a quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where how did you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a ... okay I tried to get them to change that [laughter] and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete mess quote\nOne of my own research has shown that children learn to read with out direct instruction when they are allowed to learn to read in their own ways at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of instruction and\nAh I have yet to see a child who's been self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read it in very different ages right\nWell so she usually I'm asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might while it might fulfilled them or it isn't the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if the kid doesn't\nWe can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like civics or how\nGovernment works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh you know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world aren't we sort of setting them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know Pete if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning it are they learning at in a way that is meaningful to that stays with them so let's take civics for example so\nIn schools we deprive children of all their civil rights\nLiterally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about civics is that a real civics lesson or is it better civics lesson to say\nHey you're growing up in a democracy you're growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own life\nYou are also responsible for other people you you are also free to choose your own path and happiness isn't that a better civics lesson [laughter] than a lecture on it you are living it\nYou are limited in what in what though that that you'll have ultimate the total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nBut you know something yes we do have to live in a society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society\nThey are learning how to live in a society and it's also not the case that there nobody is totally free nobody can do things that break the law\nYou know there are many many students who are in self directed education are going to learning centers or school years learning stuff and they make rules they make the rules democratically there are lots of rules you can't let her you care if you take out toys you have to put them away\nYou can't there are rules against bowling and so forth but they're democratically made rules and isn't it\nPatiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps we're we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subjects to children if they're totally self directed\nWell I'm from me I I question what the word introduce means so in in this context because\nIntroducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective there there's an indoctrination that comes from that and for me as a self directed in an schooling parent we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on and so the idea that these things will not be\nIntroduced or seen ourselves is something that\nI don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics\nAt its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready and whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happens at the playground\nOr there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that is not something that is specific to going to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere so my daughters are huge and making sure that their identity has affirmed everywhere that they go and they also participate and actions\nThat create inclusion and diversity and equity so that has nothing to do with school\nWell a ... and Peter you can imagine that we have a lot of want to join us so let me just get a couple of them in here let's go to Alex who's calling from big sky Montana Alex you're on the air\nHigh magnet thank you so much for taking my call great conversation today um you know I just want to say that I Am thirty eight years old I was raised in the Massachusetts public school system in my parents' absolutely\nPractice something very similar to this on schooling or perhaps a free range parenting and certainly they didn't call it that but they eat those with a very similar um you know they would\nPull me out of class to go to a museum or go see a movie go see family or friends if I was in a class and um had maybe completed my work early or just didn't feel engaged with the lesson of the day they would uh have you moved over to\nAnother class and on some occasions even take me to another school across town to do something over there and\nYou know I can attest that it absolutely bread a sense of curiosity and playfulness through this with me to this day but there's a double edged sword that I think anyone should really consider if they are thinking about\nPursuing the style of parenting with their own children and that is a you know in the career front I have just bounced around so much I've worked in agriculture an awkward culture I worked in the record industry I've dabbled in journalism I worked as a companion to people

packaged as social improvements\nOn our website ... radio dot org ... says uh and Kathy this isn't a response a response to something you said ... cat is saying no an amusement park is not physics physics is the math and process that results in a safe and exciting amusement park rides Kathy\nThinks this sounds just like whew nonsense ... would you like to respond to that\nI mean free caffeine and that's that's her position and I totally respect that\nUm for me I see it differently and that's that's what makes us all unique and the biggest the biggest thing about this about exploring what learning is is the liberation of being indoctrinated into a system that wasn't built for a person like myself\nIt was not built for me to truly explore and be innovative and look at this as an opportunity to really shine and that's what I'm allowing my children to do whether it has\nAn effect that may be viewed as negative or not that's you know how anyone feels is none of my business is pretty much the model I follow so as much as I appreciate her perspective um\nThat's that's what works for us and my children are learning and growing and thriving so what does it matter to me\nAnd I also have another comment here on Facebook Jennifer Russell says formal school doesn't teach children socialization Jennifer says it teaches them institutionalization let's go to Steven who's calling from Florence South Carolina Steven you're on the air\nThank you very much my question\nIf you could tell me what sort of things should I look for my child to see if he's a good candidate for this type of Orleans at what age did it again and what sort of parameters or\nBoundaries are needed if we go into this sort of um in educational process\nSteven first of all I'm going to tell you there is no such thing on this program as overly simplistic question especially when we're talking about education so I actually thank you very much for your call Peter gray do you have some answers received\nAs a question well Wendy began begins at birth [laughter] you you can't stop it from beginning at birth children are beginning to self educated as soon as they're ... they're learning constantly they're constantly learning [noise]\nSo one of the questions that I've been interested in my own research just there are there some children who are\nMore cut out for self directed education than for others and this is many people think well some people are sort of self motivated they can take control of their own life and so on\nMy experience has been that little children are all self motivated and that doesn't end if we allow it to continue it does not end if we allow it to continue\nI think the I think the important thing to ask for anybody who wants to take this route\nIs am I capable of trusting my child am I capable of allowing my child to learn what my child wants to learn even if it's not\nWhat I think my child should be learning at this point you have to give up a certain amount of sense of control now the truth of the matter\nReeling chair and my heart and let her as there is just got\nTo give up a certain amount of sense of control you have to trust the nature of children I have learned over the years to do that because of my research that just because of my own experience with my own child but because of my research with many children [noise]\nAnd because of my research into the history of humanity throughout\nAlmost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had [noise]\nAnd so children come into the world burning to educate themselves we can't stop them from it unless we lock them away and closets and so on\nBut here's what we have to understand we are now living in a world where there's way more knowledge out there that any of us can possibly learn\nAnd who's to decide what's most important for any given child\nDon't we want people to grow up learning different aspects of that knowledge why should everybody learn the same little slice of all the knowledge and skills and the information\nThat schools have decided that says the slice everybody should learn yeah you have to trust your child your child may not study physics maybe your child will study art history or whatever else maybe\nThat maybe they don't have a child you're driving isn't that a lot of the\nMatter is that your child will have a job and the reason your child will have a job is because your child has learned to take control of his or her own life my what my research shows\nIs that the graduate so self directed education are doing very well in adult life there and not having difficulty getting jobs\nLet me get a response you Michael Apple what do you think\nOh first start ... that I Want to ask one of the characteristics of the children of parents do we really want to society and the rich ... children\nA growing movement in the United states for instance of anti Semitism of\nAnti um you know clearly racist conscious things and I don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because again I think parents have an ethical responsibility to be the best for their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now\nAnd ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticizing situations that are that we're putting parents so that's my first my first response fucking this um we have to ask\nDo we want a simply to have a society in which her children are simply see parents having no responsibility whatsoever for the larger society what can we do\nTo make it more certain that the vast majority of children who will go to public schools actually you have to kind of education that as many of the characteristics that movie and Peter wanting to write\nWell Michael let me let up Peter Graham illegal respond to that Peter go ahead I I think that's a wonderful point Michael that you've made and that's something that I've given a lot of thought to and concern to\nLet me be clear I Do not think that home based on schooling is the solution to our national educational problem\nI think it's a great solution for many many families it's clearly a great solution as far as I can tell for for a ... and her daughter is is clearly a great solution for the many families that I have studied it works very well for them and it works very well for their children\nBut I don't think is the solution for everybody I think is probably even a minority of parents who should be doing this but what is happening and what is I think going to be that eventually the educational solution\nIs we're developing more and more learning centers and schools for self directed education is not happening within the public school system\nBecause the public school system has too many constraints you can move a certain direct a certain amount and the progressive direction but then there's always the pushback to go back on the other way ever since schools have become compulsory we've had progressive educators trying to push it one way and that gets pushed back the other way\nIt's happening outside of the public school system but it's happening in a way that it could eventually become affordable to everybody and I would love to see public support for this right now the alliance for self directed education is trying to bring public support\nFor Centers for self directed education so that children can be away from their parents they could be in the center\nWhere they have to learn the kind of community skills how to make rules how to live by rules how to get along with people who are different from you and have different ideas from yours different ideas from your parents I think this is all part of education is very important part of education but it's not incompatible with self directed education\n... let me just dove tail Michael apples basic question with a comment that we've

E. dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a talker body we're talking about immigration in the midterms and I'm speaking with a key Lamar sterling professor of law at Yale University where he teaches constitutional law professor Omar I'm giving you a ... a ... a few more minutes and I said originally planned but I have two\nQuick questions before I have to let you go here one is that you know the president said to act CEOs that they are telling me\nQuote unquote they are telling me that he that he could use a ... an executive order to an end birthright citizenship it is not clear at all who they are\nI'm seeing I'm a report here from Politico\nA that has sources in the White House counsel's office um and one of the sources told Politico that unless it became a policy a policy priority they didn't want to spin their wheels for long periods of time justifying the outer edges of authority for something that was probably going to be very inflammatory as well I mean do you know people in the White House counsel's office ... ... is it possible that\nI Do and one of the lead people is named Emmett flood happens to have been one of my favorite students of all time I wrote a courtship letter of recommendation to justice clear on his behalf he he got the clerk ship and and I think al ... is a very sound person and I can't imagine that he would disagree with me about what I\nSaid before I haven't talked to him but I'd be very hard because there are rules of constitutional law\nAnother person who's also I'm a student of mine Steven Engel clerked for Justice Kennedy way back when I I wrote him a letter of recommendation for Justice Kennedy a brilliant student of mine who's the head of the office of legal counsel\nThey are the body and historically tasked with giving legal advice to the executive branch of government so those would be the two offices and it just so happens that I Do know that had ... or at least ... people and and both of those departments and I'd be very surprised if they disagreed with what I said\n... now if if it's even plausible that a change like this would happen it would have to come through a constitutional amendment or some sort of ... a three fifths majority action through Congress\nNeither of which seem a very plausible at this time but you said earlier that you believe that if if the president actually issued an executive order and legal action or taken against it and it made its way to the Supreme Court that the Supreme Court would decide nine zero against the president of the United states on this issue\nAre you really confident because I'm thinking about justice cabinet right now who has you know in his own decisions on the DC circuit\nYou know as spouses quite an expansive view of executive power\nConvert Kavanaugh is an originalist he's my student um and I testified on his behalf 'em up before the allegations that occurred on September seven of\nOf this year and precisely because he is an originalist and he and I play by the same ground rules I'm a Democrat he's a Republican I'm a liberal he's a conservative but we play by the same ground rules and this is\nOn the ground rules are the text of the text there is the history precedent actually does matter all although in the end of the text and and and the history matter the most and it's just not a close question I'd be shocked at Brett Kavanaugh fed otherwise and and and and your audience might want to\nRead things that I wrote in support of the cabinet nomination before the um the various allegations occurred which we don't need to talk about on are are not really a question of how brick have enough things about the constitution and I think he thinks about the constitution in a a sound and sober way paying attention to ...\nPresident will kill them are is sterling professor of law at Yale University where he teaches constitutional law speaking to us from New Haven Connecticut professor am I think he's still very much thank you for having me to important issue well let's hear a little bit from a key member of the Republican\nParty who disagrees with the president's view that he can change birthright citizenship through an executive order your house Speaker Paul Ryan yesterday in an interview with Kentucky radio station W. V. E. okay\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives you know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer and following the plain text to the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is um ... illegal immigration\nThat's how Spiegel ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. V. okay in Kentucky or just yesterday well joining us now is Ellen ... he's joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on point radio dot org as well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program\nThanks for having me All right so you just heard that Paul Ryan and they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is this route issue unchecked illegal immigration and you know today it this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets\nAre about to immigration specifically so how's central is this as an issue to Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue um it's it's I think it started from Trump um he obviously this is something that worked for him and twenty sixteen I'm at wrote into the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he was talking about Mexicans and\nWhich Mexicans are coming into the country and all that um and he wrote that through to the White House and so for him he's just taking a page out of his twenty sixteen political playbook\nAnd applying it to this mid term um and it's and it seems like something that just kind of struck him just a few weeks ago because it was really the care of and that really started on them since October sixteenth um is running really started to you know they're going to them as such has been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America threatened to tear up the new NAFTA deal throwing the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at the ... at this point and it's still about nine hundred miles away [noise] um so he started it but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embrace that um and they've been arguing the same tax they've been taking the same tax\nUh for for weeks now and you see it and Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um it's not the defining issue of their campaign\nAnd how much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and health care last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing about immigration I'm with Republicans talking about it on the campaign trail\nWell this has been the fascinating thing to see if you pull all Americans um\nNumber one is health care and number two jobs in the economy a gun policy is number three immigration is fourth and this according to a Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolated out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue them so clearly it's working for the target audience if they are intending it\nThings are really riled up his base in twenty sixteen and so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about in record numbers of of a doozy as and when it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that\nThis is an attempt and this is a way to rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no work in the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this is strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... in ... there turn out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist here because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes the Democratic party because it's so simple we have illegal and legal ... migration and the president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years we've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it\nAnd it just seems kind of crazy we well I don't think the big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that the obviously wants to change birthright citizenship\nWhich should not be such a contentious thing I mean I'm a pro immigration guy I'm just a pro legal immigration Democrat\nI Believe in immigration and then but I Do think health care is much higher priority for me and what I Do and I think that the Democrats and Republicans both want to make changes but there's so many entrenched interests it's virtually impossible and I think each one claims each other\nAnd nothing gets done yeah things that you get on or not productive\nWell Jay thank you so much for your call I wouldn't go there let me turn back to you on that because one thing that Jay's comment makes me think of is Republicans are pushing hard on these immigration issues I mean ... advertising in debates on the campaign trail in interviews\nA but are Democrats responding or they just simply ... trying to ignore immigration is an issue and focusing exclusively on health care and does that put them at a slight weakness when it comes to dealing with\nAs you said at least in Republican mine's the number one important issue for them\nOn the one hand it's difficult for Democrats really to to to be arguing too much on immigration just because they've been in the minority I'm In Congress in both Republicans controlling the White House in both chambers so it's not like any democratic proposals over the last couple of years we're going to\n[noise] support for around ... comes from the listeners have WVU are most from Charles River

is immigration reporter for USA Today he's with us from Miami and with us from El Paso Texas is ... ... he's immigration and border security reporter\nFor the Texas Tribune and we've got lots of listeners comment coming here here on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people in town and Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tones and\nThen mark says the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I I just wanted to say that\nI Am totally in favor of sending troops to the border\nThey cares I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump does not want any violence down there\nBut it's obvious that the people are getting aid somewhere they have water bottles they have so they have money something is sponsoring this and we need to protect America\nAnd also on a lot there no I Believe in voter ID I hadn't even get once you get a library card I have to have identification to get a loan\nTo open a credit card to get a library card just starting to kill it is there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it why can't they have\nId to vote\nWill Lorrie thank you so much for your call their uh Ellen do is I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concern the issues are concerned about [noise]\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned ... and one violence that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about this care of it\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these current events or like I mean first off they're coming into the ... they're they're they travel encourage ranch for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America and Mexico is a very dangerous and never\nUm so they for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely them in the last ... curve and that got here then provides a little bit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border\nUm about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally and\nDid exactly what they said they didn't they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um and and from more reporters that we have embedded with the Caribbean moving through Mexico um the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here um ... it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred\nAnd again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee so it's going to take a long time and by the time to get here it's going to be far fewer people and not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or seek over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm In a little early in the show and then just clarify here that they are in the ... also seeking to summarily denying asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat is a no no the last bomber waiting for [laughter] before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh mid ... they were planning the Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the ... shooting and some of the other\nTragedies we've seen recently um but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale um that they use to implement the travel ban um shortly after Trump took office it was the first two versions of the travel ban were shot down by the courts but the third one survived\nAnd so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one in trying to apply somewhat similar argument to what's going on along the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nAnd the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend\nAsylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second if and when he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could grow out here\nRight now who do you like you're there in El Paso and I was I mean if you could talk to us about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one uh we between incumbent representative\nA Republican we'll heard and Gina Ortiz Jones or his Democratic challenger right because they're dead that district that heard represents has said many hundreds of miles up on the border\nTo correct It's got about eight hundred miles of the Texas Mexico border and it stretches from ... county [noise]\nUh all the way to ah to the outskirts of ... county which is includes San Antonio and Big Bend in several border counties in between you know this this this was considered a closer eats a few months ago but the latest polling shows that um\nComments when I heard is I guess he's a little bit more comfortable if I have to say that then is um or tissue on doesn't pose a significant challenge\nAnd could still you know that that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back to twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving\nA Democrats and and the protects us a little bit of hope but a congressman or heard also you know it was very public about his is the way he strives for bipartisanship and um you know he and and ... actually they you know they did that\nFacebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they had the drive back to the sea and they they ended up in the Pittsburgh lie but their journey which\nI think when I'm pretty good way for\nFor both of the Congress rent to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas or they're concerned about the wall and imminent domain and issues like port security but they are so um but by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they they think it's an action you know you talk to\nThe ranchers all along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans for the half the border patrol or people are going to their property that that's not to say they're not also\nWork or to escape you know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman hurt in the minds of his constituents has done a pretty good job of trying to strike a middle balance he's been\nSomewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but close to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more towards the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the extreme and um\nAnd Mr Mr Gomez is point earlier with respect to the caravan\nHe's absolutely right with respect that we don't know how many people are going to end up coming here and what I saw on the Britain it's you know what is on Tuesday was migrants there were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get process so with respect to the caller's concerns and illegitimate concerned about who's coming into the country\nIf you're a violent criminal lawyers can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're going to present at the port of entry when he was a lot of people are definitely\nYou know the the herd Jones race it interesting to me because uh will hurt has been I think he he represents as the as you were saying earlier how um\nThe views of communities on the border are much more they're more subtle and textured a than we might see it a ... as we get further and further away actually from from the border because I Know heard has been a very eloquent I'm advocating for more smart ... technology versus hard wall a technology between the United states and Mexico\nBut we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Alan\nHi magna thanks for taking the call uh I I think this is another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense\nUm and to play defense against emotional appeals and stay focused on this rash discuss um I think there's a lot of winning points that the Democrats have and I think they do work brings some of them out surveys so that the American public\nFavors a permanent status for the dreamers that was sort of permanent status and I think the Democrats and make the point that immigration is solve the problem with immigration can be solved immigration reform rather than through posting troops on the border\nAllen thank you for your call I'm Ellen gum and let me turn to you is that what you're hearing from Democrats are we just hearing more ... or softer tone\nI mean I think it's interesting there do they use the word emotional when it comes to the Democratic response because\nIt did it to some degree in ... there was there was quite a bit of fear for the ... over the summer um went to some ... eyes movement that that only a very small number of Democrats really truly embrace um but that became something that was left on everybody every democratic

um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on us or how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume design is that right\nYes um when I was a younger uh same junior high school and through high school my uh mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker was the free counseling service for the city\nAnd people could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew\nMy name's Tina and my mother knew about him and so we would ride with her do um you know downtown or down\nGo to ... drop us off to school and we see certain people and we\nLaugh in point or hide you know hide in the back seat\nAnd my mom would say you know he looks okay he's got a clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause in which kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know some time she would even role that window down to our dismay and say you know how ... how George you know how are you today and you know that kind of a view of you know people\nIs what I still used today to kind of embrace a individuality and that it helps within bracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all in\nYeah use because suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly occurred you know to go but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the role of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film\nThat's essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story a and so now they want to communicate that to the world constructed in that film and then to us as viewers\nYes I feel that costume design or can be just to find his story telling designed and you when people want to associate costume designer with fashion and you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but\nThe overall a I'm a goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story was what they wear\nRight so so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm ... in Hollywood I mean well let me just ask let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done what Fifteen plus collaborations with him and\nYes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter] um I met Spike Lee in Los\nAngeles a friend who's a casting director now Ravi read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for\nAnd it in the lobby I was\nShowing my portfolio to one of my friends and I I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all you know wanted to hang out together and we did and he\nKept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so I kept you know moving around in my I have this idea of getting film experience and he suggested that I call USC\nOr UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student these projects he said that would give me experience with being on a set and what that medium um would be like\nAnd so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday\nI was on the U.S see students ... are doing the costumes\nCame Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right thing so I Want to play a clip\nOn that day I was actually the first one and then do the right\nThan do I say OK I wouldn't be sure to Spike Lee fans out there like get your field longer iffy right leg [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing it's such an amazing movie to this day so I just want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is a scene where you're going to hear a John John ... who plays bugging out and he asked so the owner of the local pizzeria played by Danny ...\nUh why there are only pictures of white celebrities on the wall of his pizza shop\n... if we're going to war what role does on the wall Street Journal which which what was\nYour what your brothers are novels and dishes and nephews your stepfather stepmother whoever wants to see what this is my this American Pie is on the wall\nYou\nAlso for [noise]\nYou know might be fine so what do you watch the any American I ... if you'd laughable so since we read as much money we do have\nA scene from Spike Lee is Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer uh on that one of many collaborations she had with Spike Lee and the thing about this film outrageous I may say is that it really\nOne of his many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality of what the characters are wearing like high tops the boom boxes the the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how does that play out in your design\nWell it was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a\nA clothing uh during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and we really wanted to represent you know pop culture of a moment and\nReally create this um this intensity of color in their environment\nAnd so what we did was we created like top side of African fabrics and you see bugging out wearing can't take off shore it's that we made and\nIt was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really had that stuff will go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and\nSo because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of the color and and the styles that um we present to kind of off the fed into the combination of what eventually happened story\nWell uh we've got a lot of callers who want to ask you some questions or if so if I may turn to them to be a a delight we were talking with through the card or she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer uh she got those nominations for Malcolm X and um it started but those are two of the forty plus films that she's been a costume designer on\nThen that means we double checked [laughter]\nAnd I'm wanting more TV project I agree with an income is to you for that but we're the one eight hundred forty three eight to five five eight hundred and forty three talk so let's go to Tanya who's calling from Detroit Michigan Tanya you're on the air\nI met now

for Malcolm X. in on this died at her most recent work you've seen it it's in Black Panther she's also done the costume design for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what's love got to do with it and so much as well and I wanted to just play a quick clip\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of river Dr Martin Luther king in ... twenty fourteen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and peel striped tie and a style ink black over ...\nDon't want to\nCall someone up [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [noise]\nSeeing from the two dozen fourteen film Selma a Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you are doing a film or depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who's playing Dr King well there\nAre several images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king there's several books pictorial books that had been written and so the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one uh is that I'm a Martin Luther king was a real bust men and\n... if you look at him and his suit you notice that you know there's a little flashy area around the color of his neck where he button to shirt and it would kind of roll over the top\nAnd David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is gained weight for the role um and I wanted to sort of help that along and I made his assure callers\nSo at least smaller than would we what would be required so that I could also see that little neck role that happened I'm at the color of king shirt I Love\nThat detail [laughter] nothing I Would have ever notice to but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying a character\nYeah and the costume has to support the actor and has to help support their performance and\nI'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction of the colors during that time now to David every day the shirt colors were too tight um he never come out and I would say he never complained\nUm maybe it just felt right right for him and uh when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one hundred forty three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk coast with your questions where Ruthie Carter and how she tells he's African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\nI met an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about this when I saw Black Panther in the theater I was just blown away not only by the film but also by its potential as a teaching opportunity\nI met a future who's been working on a project on how we can use textiles and clothing to teach science technology engineering and math topics and I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate here\nOf opportunities we can't we don't just send you know right now we just sense to\nYou know being a robotics team or something like that but they could learn three D. print things they could talk about textiles with special technology in them\nLike the black Panthers suit the stores kinetic energy well what kinds of other energy could you put into\nA fabric how would you do it they're just so many opportunities here and it was so exciting\nThere and thank you for your cold Ruthie\nI Love about Sherry's lab is that it's a\nIt's an exploration and what kids can do you never can hunters estimate what your children to can do\nAnd she certainly does represent that you know she I imagined was the mastermind behind the three D. printing up the queen's crown and her shoulder mantle she created the black Panthers suits and\nAnd I think it's just a great opportunity to use it as a vehicle for for learning\nA ruse if I may I Want to talk for a minute or two or hear from you or for a couple of minutes about ... in particular one of the films that you received an Oscar nomination for for your costume design there of course that's the Steven Spielberg film\nI'm about uh about a revolt honestly on a Spanish slave ship and so we have a scene here again the films Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd you're going to hear the leader of the slave revolt Josephine Cape played by the gym on a whim sue who stands up uh during the mutiny trial he's put on trial for his labor of old and repeatedly cries for his freedom\nFor reasons for for the front of it it kind of disrupt these proceedings which I\nWas [noise]\nCry all\n\nA scene from the Nineteen Ninety seven film I'm is not that scene where the leader of the slave revolt justice in case put on trial Carter if I remember correctly in that scene a sinking is wearing a western coast right\nYes ah the abolitionist\nI and the reading we read that the abolitionist gave a clothing to the Africans and\nThere was an account that said in the courtroom they look like dogs sitting in the gallery and so I use those words to create um\nClothing that was donated especially forcing K who would have been given closing from the attorneys that were supporting the case and I also wanted to present him in a royal manner um very regal at this moment where he says give us free\nAnd you'll notice that um the African sitting there and the gallery or mostly in these white bill Louis shirts up the period and I wanted to evoke the feeling of dubbed\nHuh now is it also us maybe I was reading this wrong because I I I thought that part of the reason why\nThe slightly baggy fit uh on on just it was as you said like he had to wear borrowed close um and that's a so that they didn't quite fit properly but nevertheless gave as you were saying there's this regal field him\nYes yes and that was the ... the parrot period was a very bill we pleaded ruffled shirt yeah\nAnd and this is a particularly interesting film to talk about because I'm ... and you also did the costume design for white royalty on the fill\nUp um yes John Adams yeah and you know based on you know art history I looked at the composition of some of the great painters and\nAlso the\nThe ... and all those things are important to paint the picture of royalty and the Africans as you know when they first embark in Mystic Connecticut they are wearing blankets and\nAnd uh I looked at the cargo list on the ... ship and saw that they were carrying

V. E. okay\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship but an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here which is on track to illegal immigration\nThat's how ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. B. okay in Kentucky\nOr just yesterday well joining us now is Ellen ... he's joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on point radio dot org as well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program thanks for having me All right so you just heard that Paul Ryan and they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is\nThis route issue unchecked illegal immigration\nAnd you know today it this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets a about a immigration specifically so how central is this as an issue to Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue um it's it's started\nFrom from um he obviously this is something that worked for him and twenty sixteen I'm and wrote him to the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he's talking about Mexicans and which Mexicans are coming into the country um any real good through to the ...\nSixteen political playbook and applying it to this midterm um and it's and it seems like something that just kind of struck him just a few weeks ago because it was really the care of and that really started on them since October sixteenth um is really really started the you know digging it on this such has been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America threaten the tear up the new NAFTA deal threaten the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at that point at this point that it's still about nine hundred miles away [laughter] um so he started it but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embrace that um and they've been arguing the same tax they've been taking the same tax\nUh for for weeks now and you see it in Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um it's not the defining issue of their campaign\nAnd how much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and health care last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing about immigration I'm with Republicans talking about it on the campaign trail\nWell this has been the fascinating thing to see if you poll all Americans um\nNumber one is health care and number two jobs in the economy a gun policy is number three\nImmigration is fourth and this according to a Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolate out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue ... them so clearly it's working for the target audience that they're intending to um you know immigration is what riled up to ... one of the things that really riled up his base in twenty sixteen\nAnd so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about in record numbers of enthusiasm when it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that\nThis is an attempt in this is a way to rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no working on the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this is strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... in ... there turned out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist here because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes Democratic Party because it's so simple we have illegal and legal ... migration and the president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years we've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it\nAnd it just seems kind of crazy we well I don't think it's a big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that the obviously wants to change birthright citizenship which should not be such a contentious thing I mean I have a pro immigration guy I'm just a pro legal immigration Democrat\nI Believe in immigration and then but I Do think health care is much higher priority for me and what I Do and I think that the Democrats and Republicans both want to make changes but there's so many entrenched interests it's virtually impossible and I think each one claims each other and nothing gets done yeah things that you get done or not productive\nWell Jay thank you so much for your call Ellen ... let me turn back to you on that because one thing that Jay's comment makes me think of is it Republicans are pushing hard on these immigration issues I mean ... advertising in debate on the campaign trail in interviews\nAre ... are Democrats are responding or they just simply ... trying to ignore immigration is an issue and focusing exclusively on health care and does that put them at a slight weakness when it comes to dealing with\nAs you said at least in Republican mine's the number one important issue for them\nOn the one hand it's difficult for Democrats really to to\nYet

on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people and and Trump continues to do it I'll be at with very different tones\nAnd then mark says the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nYou I I just want to say that I Am totally in favor of studying trips to the border they I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump\nYou said that people are getting somewhere they have water bottles they have they have money [noise] something is sponsoring this and we need to protect America\nAnd also I I didn't know I Believe and voter ID I had to get one library card identification alone to open a credit card to get a library card starting to kill it is there's nothing racist about it\nAnd everybody has to do it why can't\nI Can't vote\nWell All right thank you so much for your call their uh Allen do is I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the ... the issues are concerned about\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned the idea of autism one violence at that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about this caravan\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these caravans are like I mean first off they're coming into the ... they're they're they travel in ... for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America and Mexico is a very dangerous in Denver\nUm so they for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely and the last ... care of and that got here I think provides a little bit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about\nFive hundred of them that ended up making it to the border um about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them\nUm did exactly what they said they they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um than than from mar reporters that we have embedded with the care of and moving through Mexico um the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here um the it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred\nAnd again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee\nSo it's going to take a long time and by the time they get here it's going to be far fewer people and not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or take over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm a little early in the show and then just clarify here that are isn't the ... also seeking to some merely deny asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat is a in the middle of the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh ... they were planning the Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the Pittsburgh shooting and and some of the other uh tragedies we've seen recently\nUm but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale um that they use to implement the travel ban\nUm shortly after Trump took office it was the first two versions of the travel ban were shut down by the courts but the third one survived\nAnd so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one and trying to apply somewhat similar argument to what's going on on the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nAnd the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second if and when he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could throw out\nHere right now who in August ... you're there in El Paso and I wonder if you could talk to us about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one uh we're between income the representative a Republican will Hurd\nBecause they did that just to get heard represents many hundreds of miles on on the border\nTo correct It's got about eight hundred miles of the of the Texas Mexico border and it stretches from a far east Paso county\nUh all the way to uh to the outskirts of ... county um which is includes San Antonio and big band and several border counties in between the you know this this this was considered a closer it's a few months to go out of it but the latest polling shows that um\nCongressman heard as I guess he's a little bit more comfortable to say that then is um Ortiz Jones has imposed a significant a challenge\nAnd could still you know that that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back to twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving\nThe Democrats and the protects us a little bit of hope but I'm ... congressman heard also and it was very public about his his the way you stress for bipartisanship um you know he and and ... actually they you know they did that Facebook\nLive where you know DC was was snowed in and they have the drive back to to the sea and they they ended up doing the Facebook Live of their journey which\nI think when I'm ... pretty good way for\nFor both of the Congress rent to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas you know they're concerned about the wall and imminent domain and issues like border security but they are also I'm a ... by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they they think is an action you know you talk to [noise]\nTo ranchers all along the border and they say you know they have to fix the fence or they have to call border patrol where people are going to their property in that's not to say they're not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work or to escape\nYou know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman hurt in the minds of of his constituents has done a pretty good job of of trying to strike a middle balance he's been somewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but\nCloser to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more toward the middle and stay in language Republican values but not to the to the extreme and um\nAnd to to Mr Mr Gomez point earlier with respect to the to the caravan he's absolutely right with respect that we don't know how many people are going to end up coming here and what I saw on the bridge and she was on Tuesday was\nMigrants there were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get processed so with respect to the caller's concerns and a legitimate concerns about who's coming into the country\nIf you're a violent criminal lawyers can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're gonna present at the port of entry when a lot of people are definitely doing\nYou know the the herd Jones raises interesting to me because uh we'll just didn't think he he represents as you were saying earlier how um views on communities on the border I'm much more they're more subtle and textured\nThen we might see it as we get further and further away actually from from the border because I Know her very eloquent I'm advocating for more smart well technology versus hard wall high technology between the United states and Mexico\nBut we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Alan\nHi magna thanks for taking the call um I I think this is just another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense\nI'm into play defense against emotional up ... instead focused on this rational discussion and um I think there's a lot of winning points that the Democrats have and I think better work brings some of them out surveys so that the American public\nFavors a permanent status for the dreamers some sort of permanent status and I think the Democrats can make the point that immigration is solve the problem with immigration can be solved immigration reform rather than through posting troops on the border\nThe U.S is that what you're hearing from Democrats are we just hearing more ... or softer tone\nI mean I think it's interesting the idea that you use the word emotional when it comes to the Democratic response because it ... it to some degree it has\nA ... there's there's quite a bit of fear for the ... over the summer of what this abolish ice movement that that only a very small number of Democrats really truly embrace\nUm but that became something that will slept on everybody every democratic candidate Ted Cruz has accrued better route of of of of embracing that um and that that is one of the sort of ... that's a very good example where", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "31"}
