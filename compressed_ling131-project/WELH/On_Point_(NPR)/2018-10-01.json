minute U.S Canada trade deals so this hour on points top reporters open their notebooks and look at the week ahead\nIn the news do you believe that the FBI investigation will shed any useful light on

Michael Warren senior writer at the Weekly Standard Michael thanks so much for joining us great to have you thanks for having your madness okay so here let me just start with you first I mean it seems as if we're having a lot of click conflicting reports about exactly the scope of the FBI investigation and whose putting\nYou know who's writing a the limits to that ... what do we know so far\nWell I think the first thing we have to explain to people this is that this is not a criminal investigation correct background investigation\nThat means that the FBI is serving as the ... if you will and the White House is the client the White House White House dictates what they want done\nAnd from what we understand in our reporting they want to focus on the allegations involving Dr Blass before and the allegations regarding a Deborah mirrors\nSo the FBI or we're told us they began there are interviews of Dr excuse me I'm a mystery mirrors and she gave them a list of names and again the question is\nIs the FBI allowed to pursue those names that she gave them or do or do they have to go back to the White House and ask\nFor permission if you will to go forward\nI see so Michael Ward I mean do we know any more about what might happen in in those events may maybe we do because I'm Still not fully clear on\nOh\nSupport for on point comes from Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of

News digital political reporter pure Thomas has also with us chief justice correspondent for ABC News\nAnd Michael Warren joined us today he's senior writer at the Weekly Standard and of course so much attention focused on the FBI's current background investigation into the allegations are surrounding judge Brett Kavanaugh a and we've got lots of comments here on our website on point radio dot org\nJohn in Amherst says lying and allegations aside as someone with Kavanaugh has demonstrated belligerence unbiased capable of serving as a judge on any bench let alone the\nSupreme Court well in fact this weekend Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona was asked about that on sixty minutes this was just yesterday a and here's what he described he saw in Brett Kavanaugh's temperament during Kavanaugh's testimony last week\nWhen I heard him hurt someone who I Hope I Would sound like if I had been unjustly accused and to see his family behind this Chris and ah\nIt was there was anger um but um but if I were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well\nAnd the Chris there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was also interviewed by sixty minutes and a correspondent Scott Kelly ask tunes are about the the claim or the ... or the belief that part\nOr in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line\nA lot at all surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a partisan argument that would've been best left to be made for his advocates the fighters on the committee made you wonder voters should vote\nIn my case yes it made me wonder about his ability to survive and\nThat is democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there and I keep making the same mistake I keep seeing Mike Judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here a king with human burns let me just pick up with you 'cause you're speaking to this point before\nThe break here I Wonder um you know all day on Thursday Democrats focused on their call for investigation\nThey got one they got an investigation you know its current terms they may not like\nBut I'm Wondering if you think they missed an opportunity here because you know many folks did look at for example that paragraph in judge Kavanaugh was opening statement where he talks about a left wing conspiracy talks about the Clintons 'em\nAnd you know that and perhaps some folks might say they should just simply point at that uh as evidence for of what you know might be judge Kavanaugh suit ability or lack of for the Supreme Court\nRight I think that paragraph was particularly revealing for a lot of people watching because um remember we're talking about this seat as a potential swing seat on the court from I'm at a conservative at a ideological perspective\nBut when Kavanaugh was talking about the Clintons and the left wing conspiracy I think it did raise questions about whether he would in fact be a partisan I'm a political type of person\nAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if the conversation starts to evolve this week away from the events in question in the Nineteen eighties and more towards Kavanaugh's sued ability for the court or the question though and that the point that I Would make is that\nYou know a lot of lawmakers made their decisions about half an hour even before these allegations surfaced you had many Democrats come out as soon as having all was nominated or shortly thereafter saying that they could not support him and you had lots of Republicans\nAre really cheering him on\nSo there is a question of you know how much the events of uh that we learned last week how much we learn this week\nHow much it will actually change minds I think Republicans also are considering\nThat the idea that they have wanted to shape the makeup of the courts that's been an organizing principle for them in election after election\nAnd so they have to kind of weigh that against the allegations that they've already heard and against any new information that comes out this week that pertains to the events in question and also that pertain to Kavanaugh's a personality and his fitness for the corn\nWell Michael warn me chime in here because if as Kaitlin says we do start hearing more Democrats talking about issues of temperament will that argument hold any weight now because there has been so much emphasis placed on allowing the FBI to investigate\nMen do I think if that's where the argument shifts as was suggested might\nSuggest that Brett Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed as a Supreme Court or to the Supreme Court\nI mean this is I'm a respect for you I think a ... his ah his testimony his anger you're in that in that testimony on Thursday or somehow revealed something about ah the kind of justice\n... of a his actual time on the bench she's a he said on the DC circuit court one of the most powerful or courts in the country\nOr in this claim about his partisanship has never been made a perhaps it perhaps somebody will now perhaps somebody will go back through some of his decisions and find it but so far they haven't um uh and and and I think Jeff Flake is getting at something here remember flick is one of the three Republican senators I'm we're on the fence about cabinet none of the Democrats\nAre who are who are including Chris Coons were mentioning they're concerned about his temperament of what really ever going to vote for him in the first place um will Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski a and Jeff Flake a change their mind because of the uh the angry way in which cabinet responded to what he claims are smears\nUm I don't think so if if the if the investigation finds out that Kavanaugh's lied about this or has lied about anything anything else that he's been accused of that will change things up but but the anger on display or I think a won't make a difference with the people who who matter in this decision which are those three Republican senators\nI Want to take a quick call here on this point let's go to Rick who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the Iraq\n[noise] Ricky there do maintenance high yeah go ahead ray or\nA I really don't have too much faith\nThat you will not be pushed around a district court so I'm going to be asking [noise] perhaps for civic lesson if he is a acquainted\nAnd confirmed um when will\nHe will have to decide how many cases you asked to recuse himself because of his are blasted not to carry it or the uh Clinton as an American spirit she or the other members of the court to\nDecide [noise] one recusal should and should not be used to\nRick and Rick thank you for your call peer Thomas do you want to pick up on that because\nUh I think if you know a ... judge Kavanaugh on Thursday he talked about well funded left wing groups et cetera and if you're one of those\nQuote unquote left wing groups and you bring a case before the Supreme Court would you be right to be concerned about a ... a justice Kevin Hi so iffy so becomes his ability to fairly due to Katie case like that [noise] you\nKnow it's interesting a lot of the things that were sent again we're out of anger I think what the caller is picking up on is the invoking of the Clinton for example that\nSome people thought that that was a a bit too much uh in terms of the judge and whether he recused himself the justices have a lot of latitude to determine what they feel like they they may have a conflict of interest on a but most of the judges and many of these cases see themselves as fair arbitrators on the facts\nAnd if it's not often if they recused himself from cases\nAll right well let's go to another call here Reggie is calling from ... Iowa you're on the air Reggie\nYeah so I was wondering if the FBI comes back and says they can find no evidence to support Dr Ford or any of the other accusers\nThere's a single Democrat going to change their vote because I think they made up their mind they opt for Justice Kennedy said he was going to require there were voted no on whoever was nominated I don't even think half the Democrats in the Senate believe the charges did you think it's a good cover because they want to vote no\nReggie thank you for your call Caitlin Huey burns I mean I feel like Joe Manchin is the one one democratic\nAnd that keeps coming up right I think that we have to kind of separate separate out some of these red state Democrats these are these are of course Democrats you are running for reelection this year for the Senate in states that Trump won overwhelmingly so just\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening test\nThat can be used at home by prescription only information at Colo guard test dot com and Geico offering the guy called mobile labs that guy comb overlap stores ID cards enables Bill Payne and submits policy updates and claim reports directly from a user cell phone learn more Geico dot com [noise]\n\nIs on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking this hour with Caitlin Huey burns she's CBS News digital political reporter also with peer Thomas chief justice correspondent for ABC News and like a war and senior writer at the Weekly Standard and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for it to three talk\nOr and I want to talk with all of you about the midterms here and just a just a second here but peer you said something before the break that wanted to follow up on 'em in particular because you're justice correspondent for ABC News about\nHow the the purpose and intent of the FBI's background ongoing a background investigation right now are into the allegations around judge Kavanaugh that that's supposed to provide some of the detail and clarity a around these allegations that until now we possibly don't have right\nBut I mean I just want your thoughts on this like so many people over the weekend and even today are saying how can we possibly get trustworthy clarity is the FBI isn't even investigating things like the allegations of uh\nWill people coming forward saying they want they want to talk to the to the to the federal agents about this um but perhaps no one's reaching out to them to hear them\nWell I guess we have to be very careful about describing what the investigation will unfold for example a mystery mirrors talks about the fact of this incident happening at Yale University\nSo the FBI interviews hurt and they get information from her regarding other people who may have known about this estimate contemporaneously\nSo therefore if the FBI goes in talks with those people they may end up getting information that speaks to whether judge Kavanaugh a drink to excess weather here's a demeanor change so that may end up in what's called the FBI three oh two which\nIs the the report that they fall regarding what the witnesses say again the FBI will draw no conclusions about who's telling the truth or not but what you may end up as a body of work which includes witness after witnessing the same kinds of things and again we'll that support\nJudge Kavanaugh's version of the story or will it ... you know attack\nThere wasn't a little and I mean ... I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office to say here's the list of people you can talk to full stop\nBut we don't know if they have to go back to the White House and say we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident\nCan we go talk to them um typically the FBI has the ability and the authority to go do that uh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most again\nThe question here and we're we're tiptoeing around it is is there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client their directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they one answer but at the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kevin up approved river\nAnd there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty or if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that hasn't been made public at All right\nWell it in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred uh who will vote on his a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill it's a little bit different era now [laughter]\nSo so much has so much and yet so little at the same time as change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who is not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he\nTold Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection his decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different\nCould you have done this\nIf you were running no [laughter] no not ... not a chance to show now because politics has become too sharp\nTo Puerto ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there is no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nMichael Ward I'm seeing here also is just a recent study from Hugh that says that ah Seventy six percent of potential mid term voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee or the process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this\nA it is big but I don't think we know exist\nSays that the political parties organizer animosity is not you know politics is as much about ah who do you hate or maybe a little nicer who you are not like who do not want to see\nIn power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been a and organizing for ... for Democrats who who sort of woken up uh in our on our are expecting a a good election in the midterms um\nMy question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up an an energized to vote in the midterms\nI think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans are have a\nHave been energized huh I don't think the Trump Administration as it's gone on a has given him Republicans much to be excited about\nPerhaps a and we'll have to wait to see how ... is a week or so after the uh the the hearings last week\nUm perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege many uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the way that uh that women voters might respond\nI'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite a view that you might expect and say that I'm actually judge Kavanaugh's treatment\nI'm a as makes them more willing to go out and vote for Republicans we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this is something that does animate voters a in a way that uh that that that does energized from to get out of the ... ah in November ...\nIn fact we heard the president himself over the weekend at those rallies galvanizing his orders and saying you know if you want to\nPreserve the uh the futures of ... judges judge Brett Kavanaugh will go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look on the we've got so many comments on our website I'm seeing your saying\nThat's a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the cabinet nomination the women of the Senate block it or he is confirmed\nAnd the women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that is a comment on our website on point radio dot org let's go to Steve who's calling from Bangor Maine you're on the air Steve\nAnd I would agree with that post that is absolutely I find that in my own ... you know all of this local\nUm it's a generational thing where at least social media is lit up and I think\nThere are females are are motivated now they've listened to their mothers or the grandmother say you know uh uh the slogans like we really haven't come a long way baby and we have this is like\nWhere we haven't changed we still have men mostly now in their fifties who are making decisions you know on a health care pay you know talk about sexual assault in the U.S military an old man still haven't done nothing control the military and they\nAnd and so I think ... the bottom line is meals are motivated organizing a Alexander Alexandria court as New York Fort gee that's another one yeah like all that are normally you know that you know it really happened women can't really you know get out of the kitchen\nWe'll see you know since you brought up the uh the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a victory there I I Want to actually take that and thank you so much for your call and turn it to Caitlyn Huey burns because you know we heard Michael say earlier just a minute to Michael worn saying\nThat um you know he asks and I think it's a good question uh you know how many democratic voters are they're left to be woken up for these midterms hum but as the caller pointed out there's the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nUh in Massachusetts as well I mean to those those those campaign so they won because they brought voters to the polls who's ... who had never voted before so you could the cabinet stuff further galvanized those young people\nWell I think that Michael brings up a really key point and something that the question that I've been hearing from Republicans as what is the ceiling of enthusiasm for Democrats we know that it is there we've seen it and the turnout numbers from the primaries we've also seen in terms of women", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018",
