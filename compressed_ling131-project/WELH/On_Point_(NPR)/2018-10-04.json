Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us\nIn our own point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of go you gave us the top three bullet points of the\nUh aspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what do you mean\nOh well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago Michael this is how I was like we hung out together yeah I Know it was really fun Aslam\nAnd I think I mean as you know there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic the healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage of fat people with metabolic healthy obesity and some studies find a much larger percentage\nAnd I actually you know for team up feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter that we know how\nDifficult weight is to lose and we know how harmful it is to shame people for their weight\nAnd so if there are big health effects of obesity I'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important you know I mean I I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man\nTheir health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things\nBut he needs to talk to me about those things in a\nHealthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices what are your drug use practices and not in this way that\nHello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that I mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino was the way that you guys had an hour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them\nAnd that's something that with primary care providers a lot of patients just never get that luxury\nAnd listening to what they say and believing them well a lot of patients period will never get that luxury primary care physicians\nDoctors to ever go ahead yeah so am I Want to touch on a few points number one I Want to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I can tell you that patients on the extremes meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity\nI'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has either mild moderate to severe obesity\nI'm so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes we buy and stigma so I Want us to to make sure that we don't do that\nNow this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity\nIs such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define\nClearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology what we're finding is that this term metabolic fully healthy obesity is is a little bit falling out of favor because we're we're finding is that even in patients where things appear normal on the surface\nThey do have issues so for example\nI have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients that obviously have moderate to severe obesity um and when you look at them they may have no obesity ... more but conditions at the time of surgery\nWhat we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and with that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease\nNow if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound of their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have liver disease but when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence that we're sending to surgery actually have\nFatty liver disease Ninety five percent Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this so that shows you that we're not picking up on something in a way that we might in an adult patients you a question of ... about this because I think you know there's something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing out like\nBut but why should a neurologist though be talking to someone about their weight when that person is there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said Dr Stanford because how\nA neurologist isn't going to find evidence of of fatty liver disease anyway these new lives but let's look at what you guys just said and this is I'm going to put all my medical have because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity\nHave a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs they are ... there used to treat migraine headaches also are great for weight loss\nSo when I find that my patience and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients have a history of migraine headaches and have obesity I might concurrently be treating with the medication both disease process if I'm getting rid of their migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation\nSo I Would say that they're neurologist approaching them maybe from the lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all organ systems sooner ... is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that\n[noise] well I think I mean the story that I'm hearing\nFrom fat people are not that they're neurologist or saying you know we have a couple of morbidity do you mind if we run some tests\nThe stories that I'm hearing are we won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing from people that their doctors refuse to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors refused to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight I think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate\nWeight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor and I think that\nBecause not every fat person goes to the doctor seeking to lose weight a lot of them feel like their life is finally feel like their habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already on a planned by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight and some other way all they needed a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get in a train accident\nThey need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix it ... D located shoulder\nAnd so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that\nFat people are not getting effective medical care and a lot of fat people just shows up in studies to that fat people avoid going to the doctor because they're afraid that they're going to get shame for their weight they don't get cancer screenings because they're afraid of what the interaction with the nurse is going to be like they don't want to be weighed and I think if you're thinking about effective care\nI think it's fine for a neurologist to bring up hey you know based on the research we have a couple of things that are related weight might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not ... the kinds of interactions that people are having\nIt's really important to think about how pervasive weight stigma is and how weight does this credit patience with their doctors often times in specialties that are really only tangentially related to weight ducks\nNever go ahead yeah so I Do agree that we as physicians overall don't do a great job of approaching patients that struggle with their weight secondary to our own biases\nAnd an adequate education surrounding how to treat patients that have obesity and what we do know when you do cover this in your article is that um education surrounding obesity nutrition physical activity and medical schools residency programs throughout the country is minimal at best\nUm I can tell you that there are several organizations working on improving the standards um surrounding this issue because we do know that forty percent of the adult population has obesity and Nineteen percent of the pediatric patients has will be the which means that this is by far the most prevalent chronic disease and so I agree that we do have some work\nUm I Would say that if patients are concerned about the care they're getting and if they want and dedicated care I Would seek out on a fellowship trained obesity medicine physician like myself are one that has undergone training and certification by the American board of obesity medicine\nAnd I just jump in here for a second yeah because if you're living in Boston or Seattle or Chicago or Houston maybe you can find that blood ... what if what if you're living in a rural county that doesn't have the time\nThat we're doing a really good job so the American board of obesity medicine has certified twelve hundred physicians in obesity and different sub specialties from neurology to OBGYN to pass all gee in recent years and what you can do is you can go to the American board of obesity medicine site\nType in your ZIP Code and see which doctors are certified and I'm In that area there's no pay wall to get through you can see\nWho is working in the space in your area but I Would agree with Michael that often we do sell the patients and patients do delay seeking care when they feel as though they're going to receive some type of judgment um within the space of medicine and which they're not respected for their weight\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from Oberlin College of engineering hosting remaking education a national gathering including educators students and business leaders November second at Boston's paramount letter stories of transformative learning more act remaking ... education and Geico\nOffering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks rescue these and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar to you were talking about ... efforts or maybe a call to rethink how we think about the obesity epidemic in America I'm joined today by Michael Hobbs\nHe's a staff writer at Huffington Post and he wrote an article called everything you know about obesity is wrong\nAnd also with us is Dr ... Cody Stanford she's the obesity she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital and Dr Stanford and Michael so many callers I just want to let people have their say let's go to Seth who's calling from Johnson City Tennessee you're on the air Seth\nHi thanks for taking my call\n'em so I just got on to talk about something that Michael brought up near the beginning of the episode where he talked about the way that his mom was treated kind of um by her friends and then kind of her behavior home um I think it's really interesting because I've struggled with my weight my entire life\nUm but I've never really what my wait hold me back\nAlways seems to be the prejudice reaction I'm kind of the stigma and things like that but I get from other people um that really hold me back so Johnson City Tennessee the huge area outdoors activities or giant um so I'm always very active however\nThere have been several times in my entire life where I just don't get included and thing because people think that my weight will hold them back uh-huh I'm so it's kind of interesting that it doesn't just affect me but it also affects my relationship kind of very broadly\nYeah well ... thank you for your call a and thank you for sharing your story I Want to get Cindy in here who's calling from Charlotte North Carolina Cindy you're on the air\nHi thank you I got to play one is about the definition of it is I Am a very you're very active by well\nAnd what I yeah I Am airports will be so that the very definition of a case that's what counts enough scale and\nMay not be and I write but that that's that's that's one point\nTalk about what it underlying the eating that if you're so you know as a society we treat them not all I Know of any area of the art is absolute caretakers decades they're carrying for everybody you know like\nThey were\nAll love for close and personal heretic and I never hear about that\nMay be a solution for it if it's ... ... people\nCindy Cindy let me just jump in here thank you for your call because doctors Stanford go ahead yeah so am I said you have to address few appoints thanks so much for calling in number one I'm you talked about the ... which is what the World Health organization uses for obesity and I would say definitely there are some some challenges with that I can tell you\nThat with each patient that I see I pay attention to the weight\nThat I pay very close attention to wait distribution so central out of possibly mean weight that security net midsection\nIs most concerned because that does predisposed patients to um heart disease and other illnesses such as fatty liver so\nI Would say that if for someone like yourself who seems to be a more muscular where to be a mind would not be necessarily the best criteria I Would pay attention to that we circumference of targeting a waste a conference of thirty five inches or less than we do have significant study's based upon the ATP three guidelines that support that\nI'm with regards to the psychology I'm actually if you look at a doctor I'm Sorry Michel hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr ...\nFrom them gee each weight center was interviewed and we do have all of our patients um spend time with the psychologist delving two issues um such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors and of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life\nSo I Do think that that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like doctors all working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops to do a good job by bringing those voices into the artist so I Want\nTo switch you can switch gears here for a second um and and take a step back and Michael or bring you in back in here for this as well\nBecause I'm Dr Stanford I just I've heard you a couple of times when this conversation you know call ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight but\nFifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese American anywhere where near what we have now so I mean I don't I don't think anyone's gonna say that\nThe this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and ... and so so this is such a layperson question but I just want to get your fuel for an ... and Michael you too [noise]\nIs it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it kind of happened overnight\nAbsolutely I think this is I'm really we are in an OB so genetic environment so I call it the perfect storm\nWhat we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality and duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances what I mean by that is that we are rewarded with being able to talk to our colleagues in Russia\nAnd talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states to tell you the\nMaternity is terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that not not jokingly right if you're talking about sleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who you know a lower income getting that high quality food Michael you\nThen the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega\n[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more\nThat assumes that people have the time to exercise and the their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids\nAnd two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen and processed and whatever else and that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have\nWe we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and the choices that we make with in those options\nI don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them to do\nAnd so the reason why I wanted to bring this up to up to Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um\nEven in that context this conversation it it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know a ... individual responsibility or things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to look way outside of that\nWe have to go outside the box we need to bring together a person's in healthcare persons in that our policymakers\nUm physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a\nIn a direction where we actually had any dead on obesity rates in both a pediatric an adult population and and I think what we've done with regards to this epidemic his work\nEntirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and\nOh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world\nWell let's get another call in here arenas calling from Providence Rhode Island Reno you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call\nUm I in a primary care doctor Johnston Rhode Island just outside of Providence and um [noise] it's it's a wonderful conversation I'm outside of my office just nodding my head very enthusiastically about all the comments that people are making\n'em and I had read Michael's article and sent it actually did it all the other providers in the office because I think it's such an important concept of how we speak to our patients about this and I just wanted to comment on the\nUm the nuances of how you speak to people about this\nConversation because it's so individualized so a lot of times I'm trying to frame how I speak to people about focusing\nOn their health and you know wanting to care about the quality food that they're putting in their bodies and the benefits of exercise for how they feel about themselves\nAnd then from the patient side of things a lot of times people want to lose weight you know not just for their help that they they care about how they look and how they feel about

of transformative learning more and remaking ... education [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're going to spend some time taking a close look at George Brett Kavanaugh's\nTestimony that he gave before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony says uh about his character and whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court now we're joined by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece in titled\nHow we know Kavanaugh is lying that's on point radio dot org the link to it\nAnd like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House\nFor a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe Ford and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org\nOkay anything so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through a couple of them and get your analysis and of course and it goes response as well\nSo here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific freezes a that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book\nDevil's triangle drinking yeah how's it play three glasses and a triangle and you're quite quarters you know ... sort of quarters\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nUm because nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence that this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh's mouth during his testimony a devil's triangle is a common slang phrase for a free ...\nAnd uh it's a it's a central time and uh in Brett Kavanaugh's testimony he tried to paint himself he tried to the reason this is important because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself\nAs a kind of innocent and high school said he was in Virginia but to charge you volunteer soup kitchen\nHe helped intellectually disabled children and this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy it was totally out of touch with the person that he was not devil's triangle is actually\nA a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the more important ones are like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern and that is one example of a huge pattern in which Brett Kavanaugh evaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college says to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of a guy\nAnd ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the Senate to know that and so he didn't admit or any of the things that suggested that he did actually know a powder and think about sex in high school and things that would make for that gives you more credible\nWell uh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kavanaugh said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to ... and actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly remove later but but Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you ...\nWe also see um I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so\nWho has been pushed to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper partisan this moment is that he can he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to you know what my I I don't know I'm just what might be like kind of the ... the things that Seventeen year old boys say to each other\nBecause it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something\nMuch much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think\nThe hyper partisanship at the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things\nThe problem is that there's this thing called a swore an oath and you take it when you testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh is a federal judge and he's seeking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty of the whole point is that you have to it's a it's sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you look more credible in fact that's entirely the point\nThe reason that he lied about these things\nI'm is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it was heart a him in his attempt to make Christine Ford looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd it's a green what he said\nI watch these hearings because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd P TST symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible that though she may have been assaulted it was not break having all and I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been him to prove a and the number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person and then I hear people like a Nathan Robbins and saying things like nobody's ever heard of the stringing came everybody knew\nWell those are not factual statements we have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character sixty five women from high school thing we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like\nBut I ... that seems to be discounted which bothers me\nAs a person is really interested in the truth and sneezing statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew as an example of that faith analysis and in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and his examples of why this drinking a mentally he says it means which I find kind of feel the mind it honestly\nIs nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which\nWe didn't have in Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have\nThe I I wasn't in the DC area Nineteen eighty three\nUh but that means he's lying and the additional proof is a nation's friend Pete Davis who went to high school in the DC area\nIn two thousand eight\nThat's not proof and I don't think that is even just crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know ... Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that\nIn the Internet age devil's triangle now means this thing is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about this drinking game Nathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that\nI mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this thing of it proceeds brick having us testimony you know having to discuss it I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and\nThe most major lives are much much much more significant ah like saying I never attended a gathering with the people forward says now on his calendar\nThe people that Ford says he attended a gathering with when he says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen\nIn fact one of the ... and he's he's ... he's at Ford's friendly when Kaiser\nSays that this didn't happen that's not what layering Kaiser says lay when ... says she believed Dr Ford which means it did happen it will say you misrepresented actually it would be awesome if she believe belief does not mean that it did happen just to be what she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that strongly that it didn't happen\nShe believes that it happened right her opinion is that forward is telling the truth\nRight not but it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says what they say it didn't happen that falls that's a false statement as a full representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's false he did we know from his calendar\nOkay so ... and like I'm going to come back to you for a second on this but I just want to play these two moments that Nathan is referring to\nFirst of all here is Brett Kavanaugh again before the Senate Judiciary committee last week uh in fact in his opening statement saying the calendar that he kept in high school a show that he he says that he never attended a gathering with people that the professor Ford named\nNone of those gatherings record of a group of people to Dr Ford as far as my calendar show I was very precise about lifting all was they're very precise\nAnd then in an exchange with democratic Senator Chris Coons a judge Kavanaugh asserted that uh the witnesses who attended the party that professor Ford said the assault happened that they have submitted statements are saying that it didn't happen and here's what judge Kavanaugh said\nJust one emphasizes all four witnesses who were allegedly at the event of said it didn't happen\nNow on like a green I'm actually we know that what the statements the statements of the witnesses submitted say that they have no recollection\nWhich is categorically different than saying it didn't happen\nSo my question to you is you know were repeatedly told the judge is getting tell juries that if a if a witness a or a defendant seems I'm a ... not credible or perhaps misleading in one area of their testimony that it's fair to wonder if they're being misleading in other areas of the ... of their testimony why does not apply to judge Kavanaugh now\n\nSupport for on

solutions and automated data migration learn more at ... dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words again we're not looking at the past but what he said\nContemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court and we are joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and what and if a green she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist\nAt real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is an exchange with\nUh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator ... a Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school was\nThere ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before\nI don't know I remember what happened and I think you're probably a beer sir um and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course those people will remember just having a after a break came back and apologize to senator ...\nAnd I could agree and I wanted to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the weekly standards pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that um quote even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breath ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotionally passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore\n... ... what's your response to that I think the fact\nThat he apologized to fire Clovis churches that he felt that he had come across as too aggressive\nThat I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process this is you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be very lovely reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human has really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kinda damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech to make sure that he is clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person is going to want to do that he understands the repercussions in ...\nSay well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robbins has said cagey\nUh but if he is ... and just and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened\nAnd the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen\nWhich is a click away saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying\nOh well now he's lying under oath and so I think it's important to remember he's a human I think this moment showed that he was human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice Nathan your take\nWell what are called colloquial I call false right just just misrepresenting the facts that but I actually cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like I'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says\nI was number one in my class in high school well that that's not an answer to the questions right and and the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character accusing him of drinking is directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh is why it's so important for him to be honest and to answer those questions directly\nNobody's going to hold it against him if he says look I I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the ... club like uh because I I drank a lot and\nYou know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates of your time to talk to a dozen of his classmates who all say\nThat he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college\nUm and and and and they say that they say that directly with his freshman year roommate who said he was a belligerent drunks\nUm we have the uh University of Washington I'm headed the are gone to college and go on to college in apartment who says I used to drink with Brett\nThe it's not credible she said it is not credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes is different from how he remembered the night before that is what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who were participating with him and watched him all say that's just not credible he he he'd listen as high school yearbook he's part of the city club that tried to get through a hundred K. eggs in a year\nYou know in ... judges memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart Kavanaugh who feel ... everywhere\nUm and he wouldn't even admit that he was bought a cabin off um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will ... you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that is also in the NBA\nLet's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the on Ethan\nHi thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I did think that Brett Kavanaugh was lying and I wanted to say so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted the allegations about and when that wasn't true\nI also talk to the claim that there was a Clinton revenge street going on as over the top accusations but I don't think the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not or you can be sure he led regardless of if you will your doctor for it or not\nI don't think that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lie to Congress back when he was getting a lot of tension traumatic turn and none of the Republicans are cared about it or want to do\nAnd then I don't think they do now and measuring the group of people supporting cap and all I found it very ironic that they have the phrase stand with Kavanaugh because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker in my experience was that the political slogan used to\nLook people there's a hash tag I stand with Christine I mean stand with so and so it seems to be a very very common way of expressing support for whomever it is that you expressed support for Nathan\nOh okay I'll I'll I'll look it up for it but we are you a lot of yard signs during a ... lot trustworthy so when you actually have a science thing was that was kind of all I'm like oh my gosh oh\nNathan thank you for your call and if a green let me turn back to you I think Nathan broader point is that he doesn't feel that no matter you know whether that that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that to judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but\nIn ... he sees a whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress and all of the congressional Republicans and they're going to\nA they're going to confirm him anyway and uh he he objects to the ... what's your most in even\nWell actually what nation is saying is that he sees a line of lives and that's much stronger than misstatements I mean I I as a more trying to see this more objectively I say well maybe he did make misstatements\nUm I don't think that the for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink and high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he said in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd in his calendar you know you look at a statement like oh well they said that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described there is no gathering that says to leave when Carter was there who also said I don't know him I didn't go to parties with him Dr Ford clearly described a different type of gathering et cetera\nBut like we are talking about what is the use of going through things that can't be proven from years ago and I think we even saw this um and and that was last Republicans were trying to sift through this and said we\nNeed to hear from people who are coming forward with these allegations how do we start to do this because it was going to live with the political circus so they got a prosecutor who is experiencing bringing forth cases of sex crimes she came out with a report which I didn't see mentioned\nUh in in Nathan's piece it all a where she said I found this weaker than a he said she said case based on inconsistencies in her testimony and so I think it's important to be fair saying look\nYou can find inconsistencies of people are human they were talking about things for the best of their recollection and when you're being questioned in front of every camera and the nation or before a panel senators whether your Christine forward or Iraq having all that is an intimidating\nPlace to be in and I think really when we come down to is\nIf he's telling the truth\nIs she does he deserve to have his life destroyed over it does he deserved to have all the people numerous people he has one freshman roommate saying oh XYZ about his character then he has\nOr on our mobile app but again the phone

drinking culture on American college campuses today I'm joined by meddling DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard also joined us She's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and is now a first year law student at the George Washington University School of law\nAnd jak McCarthy is with us he's in Tempe, Arizona he's a Twenty one ... year old senior at Arizona State university and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk we want to know what you think about college drinking culture\nNow ah and again as we talked about before\nBefore the break we're we're we're discussing this given in the light of the hearing some regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if you're in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now to all come back to haunt you were at\nEight hundred forty three eight to five five as I said and we got a lot of\nComments coming in on social media and on our website\nAh for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town and my residence is surrounded by college housing Thursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students carrying racks of course in the next party\nA until the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed the shows no evidence\nIn this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York He's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research at high risk alcohol consumption in college students\nFor three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse lovely Perkins welcome to you thanks very much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this this story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about\nCampus drinking culture now ... are we at a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think what what I was hearing from them is not something uncommon that you will hear students or or even graduate says they reflect back I have to say [noise]\nUm we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were even going back Thirty years ago if I might say a quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campuses based on\nA scores and scores of studies the over arching irrefutable findings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking\nIt is significant and sometimes quite tribes and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise] are prevalent and they're at their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old\nAnd those are compared to any other age population and compared to non college young adults are the same age it this is the heart of of the problem is when we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk\nThose levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains having said that\nEven given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college it is not now nor has ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students\nThe best measures of a of of of high risk drinking are about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally in high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent\nMight be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers\nAnd it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students\nConsume two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched one quarter of students are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consumed\nSo the high risk drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious problem looking at some significant\n... yeah so so as a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe said if I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that\nWell uh sometimes today with the word a binge drinking issues and typically what is used most commonly and measures are measures such as using\nFive or more drinks at a setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise] more recent decades that we have better measures that focus on it used to talking about drinking five or four more in a two hour period because\nThat is sitting sometimes for college students might mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nUh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level up\nTo a high risk level such as a point oh eight which was the I'm a legal to limit the in terms of driving when a one gets above appointed away when it gets into the serious risk areas and that's a so if we're talking about drinking a five or more in a two hour period without intention is\nTheir consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yes\nWhat I think is interesting about what the difference may potentially be if we're going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades is that\nThere does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which when I've spoken to my parents are people from previous generations seems to be different it seemed people seemed shock that there are just handles of a car or whatever the easiest to get hold of\nEasily available sit like basically right off the bat your freshman year\nAnd I don't know maybe ... or jak find that to be similar experience their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[noise] yeah um I think there's probably a fifty fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking heart alcohol or beer um depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for um hell gates before football game tended to be more beer\nGear heady whereas party hosted at fraternities for you know whatever that tended to be more um hard liquor centric do I think that's definitely a a notable point okay and Jack\n[noise] um I Would definitely agree with ... like if you're going to a tailgate or something it's definitely going to be beer heavy but\nI think definitely for house parties and certain things like that are hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carry your carrying around a thirty case of beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient and just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends okay we'll\nPerkins I mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that same trend\nRight well I think it is true that are depending on what the particular contacts you might see more beer being consumed or [noise] or more hard liquor\nBut the the fact of the matter is that uh we could go back decades and find a a punch in grain alcohol being poured for big parties uh that were quite common in certain circumstances back in the Nineteen seventies eighties and so forth [noise]\nUm and uh still nationwide beers a drink of choice although a in some sectors and some schools\nAre some hard liquor may have in increased popularity but it's when we use the word trends of uh we're just not seeing major trends without regard of and the bottom line still is how many drinks you're consuming how quickly and if you haven't been eating at all\nThe you know it can enter your bloodstream pretty quickly no matter what type of alcohol you're consuming certainly of heart alcohol can can enter your bloodstream very quickly if you're doing\nJohn shots in a row and that sort of thing but if you are trying to drink as many beers as you can in a row that can be equally um a devastating too so [noise]\nUh I think we have to temper the the notion that oh it's just hard liquor is it's a new phenomena and and it explains all the problem is that it's a it's a mixed picture\nStill looks just a we have so many college when I joined us callers I promise I'm going to get to you but I Want to ask was the ... one more question here because you know look I I get it there maybe some people listening to this saying why all the shock\nI mean you you just made me you sound like you know a a a shock teetotaler who's saying oh my God there's so much drinking on college campuses\nMaybe it's not I mean it is a demonstrably different than it was Thirty years ago and if not what's the big deal jak was Perkins because I mean I think there's an argument to be made that\nSupport for on

senior at Boston College Brianna Picard joined us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's a first year law student at the George Washington University School of law\nJak McCarthy is with us he the Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges he's been conducting research\nOn high risk alcohol consumption for several decades were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about to read your to eat\nAnd the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find a shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magnum\nFirst of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to the show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nThat's not fair to anyone who's suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself\nNow insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress\nIt does concern me a little 'cause there's a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just\nLet me just talked to Madeline and ... and Jack here I mean respond to what's what's even saying and Jack I'm going to just start with you\nIs it is it a major way drinking to blackout that people use to relieve stress because I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major way to truly stress I think a major way to relieve stress to grow with your friends and have a couple of drinks are crowded with saying you got on Thursdays there'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks [laughter]\nThere's there's not that people aren't going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight I got some good some more of like you just\nCut yourself off because you go to a party and there's like there's all called there and you started drinking and drinking and then you walk out but it was a million different ways relieve stress the button you know it's not a common one I Would say\nOK so Brianna against even Irving says ah why do you find a shocking to you that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak their million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a how centric city you go for a run or you you go to the gym if you're stressed and have things to do for a school or work or other things that are laying down on you know\nI'm or ultra light jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class and he'd grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework um you're definitely not going out on a Thursday and\nSaying you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to\nDrink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to a blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time um at least not\nNow in law school an undergrad one needy your responsibilities weren't as much as they are earning now um you go out on a Wednesday because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that but certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to try different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least\nIn my life as blackout just kind of used almost colloquially like you you were like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means it's kind of on normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nWe're like as to what the comment on lines and [noise]\nI don't like I don't know that\nWe are all blacking out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language out in a way that it might not have been before [noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the air Veronica\nHi thank you for taking my call um I guess from here I already graduated from college

of transformative\nLearning more and remaking dot education [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're going to spend some time taking a close look at George Brett Kavanaugh's testimony that he gave before\nThe Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony says uh about his character and whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court now and we're joined by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece in titled\nHow we know Kavanaugh is lying that's on point radio dot or the link to it\nAnd like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House for a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe forward and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org\nOkay anything so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through a couple of them and get your analysis and of course and it goes response as well\nSo here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific phrases that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book\nDevil's triangle drinking in how's it play three glasses and a triangle and you're quite quarters you know ... it's a quarter scare\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nUm because nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence that this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh's mouth during his testimony a devil's triangle is a common slang phrase for a free some\nAnd uh it's a it's a sexual time and uh in Brett Kavanaugh's testimony he tried to paint himself he tried to the reason this is important because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself\nAs a kind of innocent in high school is that he was a Virginia but the charge volunteer soup kitchen he helped intellectually disabled children and this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy it was\nNow devil's triangle is actually a minor one of the examples compared to a lot of the more important ones are like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern and that is one example of a huge pattern in which Brett Kavanaugh invaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college says to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of a guy\nAnd ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the Senate to know that and so he didn't admit or any of the things of that suggested that he did actually know out of think about sex in high school and things that would make for its out gives you more credible\nWell uh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kevin uh um said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to a ... and actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um that was quickly removed later\nBut but Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you just let me just push you on this a little bit because we also see um I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so\nWho has been pushed to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper partisan this moment is that he can he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to\nYou know what might I don't know I'm just what might be kind of a junkie things that Seventeen year old boy say to each other because it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something\nMuch much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think\nThe hyper partisanship of the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things\nThe problem is that there's this thing called a swore an oath and you take it when you testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh is a federal judge and he's speaking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty of the whole point is that you have to it's a it's sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you look more credible in fact that's entirely the point\nThe reason that he lied about these things I'm is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it was heart a him in his attempt to make Christine Ford looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd it's a green what he said\nI watch these hearings because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now as I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd P TST symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible that though she may have been assaulted it was not break half an hour and I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been him to prove a and the number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person and then I hear people like a nice in our audience and saying things like nobody's ever heard of the stringing came everybody knew well those are not factual statements\nWe have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character sixty five women from high school saying we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like\nThat I that that seems to be discounted which bothers me as a person is really interested in the truth and to me saying statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew as an example bad\nFaith analysis and in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and his examples of why this drinking a meant what he says it means which I find kind of filthy minded honestly\nIs nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which we didn't have a Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle\nWell I Wonder if part of the problem here is the nature is the forum in which this testimony was given right because even in this conversation we kind of flow back and forth between\nHolding a standards of of what truth telling would be in a in a court of law versus ... in front of the Senate I mean it it wasn't a criminal investigation or a deposition in a criminal case he was ... it was he was given it was in a political arena I mean does that not count does not matter at all in your analysis Nathan\nThe purpose of a sworn an oath of lying to Congress as a federal crime it's a ... it's punishable by up to five years in prison he is a federal judge she has to hold to a standard of honesty\nIf a federal judge is willing to violate the law by misrepresenting the contents of his calendar by saying that you know his high school a classmate said he vomited a lot because he had a weak stomach even though we have a letter in his own handwriting saying they were drunk and prolific ...\nUm that that serious right and if a judge and just wanting the lay of the law oh we can't trust him to apply the law and a judge can't be above the law is very very\nImportant well we'll come back and keep digging into this and just a moment we're speaking with Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and also with Anna Greene she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist for real\nClear politics were asking the question is did what judge Kavanaugh sad and how he behaves but more specifically what he said his a Senate hearing last week that give you confidence or raise some questions in your mind about his ability to sort of on the United States Supreme court where at one eight hundred\nFor two

businesses including automatic back up for servers and computers\nI availability and disaster recovery solutions and automated data migration learn more and carbonate dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words again we're not looking at the past but what he said\nContemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court or joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my editor green she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist\nAt real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is an exchange with\nUh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator Amy Klobuchar Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I don't know I remember what happened\nAnd I think you're probably a beer center and and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before a part of what happened\nIt's you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course those people remember just having a after a break came back and apologize to senator ...\nAnd I agree and I wanted to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you're Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the weekly standards pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he said that\nThere was a ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore ... ... what's your response to that I\nThink the fact that he apologized to fire Clovis churches he felt that he had come across as too aggressive\nThat I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process this is you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be a very loudly reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human because really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kinda damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech to make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person is going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in our justice system\nThen we're going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robbins has said cagey\nUh but if he is ... and just and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened\nAnd the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen\nWhich is a click away saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so I think it's important to remember is a human I think this moment showed that he was human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice\nNathan your take well\nWhat are called colloquial I call false right just just misrepresenting the facts that but I actually cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like I'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says\nI was number one in my class in high school well that that's not an answer to the question right and and the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character by accusing him of drinking it's directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nIs why it's so important for him to be honest and how to answer those questions directly\nNobody's going to hold it against him if he says look\nI I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the ... club like uh because I I drank a lot and\nYou know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates of your time to talk to a dozen of his your cost my two all say that he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college\nUm and and as I say that they say that directly with his freshman year roommate who's the use of belligerent drunks\nUm we have the uh University of Washington I'm headed the uh got a call to go on called you department who says I used to drink with Brett\n... it's not credible she said it is not a credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes are different from how he remembered ah the night before that is what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who were participating with him and watched him all say that's just not credible he he he lists since high school yearbook he's part of the city club that tried to get through a hundred K. eggs in a year\nYou know in March judges memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart Kavanaugh who you'll be up to everywhere\nUm and he wouldn't even admit that he was bought oh Kavanaugh um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will that falls you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that's also when you\nLook at let's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the air Nathan\nI thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I Do agree that for a job and\nWas claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted the allegations about him was that wasn't true\nAre you also talk the claim that there was a Clinton revenge thing going on as over the top accusations bought idled sakes the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be lied regardless of whether or not or it can be sure he led regardless of if you will your doctor for it or not\nI don't think that will stop the Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lied to Congress back when he was doing a lot of attention from act turns and none of the Republicans are cared about Al Gore wanted to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "04"}
