Jane Fonda also writes the uh the introduction for your new book ... so so what's the connection to her\nWell you know I'm actually I'm I'm actually choked up hearing that a her say those things so lovely you know I I've always admired her in fact when\nWhen she showed up on the cover of life magazine in March of\nOf Nineteen sixty eight at our house I remember a emulating the post on the cover of that life magazine she's uh she's on the covers as Barbara ... and it was a pivotal point for me because I thought so much beauty so much strength\nOr and then I ... years\nTo probably to the day she gave me the star she presented me with the star in the Hollywood walk of fame but I've always admired her just because of how many lives that woman has been able to fit into one lifetime and not coming to this planet I always feel like the boy who fell to earth\nAh that was always Michael that's way dragon shape shifting or wearing all these different hats\nAnd I've always looked up to her for that but um before that I just it on her show Grayson Frankie a\nAnd a with a Lily Tomlin and it was absolutely beautiful and that's coming up on the next season of grace in front yeah\nWell you know we told folks over social media that we were going to be talking to you are today and we got so many questions from them that I I don't want to give them short shrift you mind if I ask you some of the questions that we got sent to us here\nI don't mind if you don't mind me saying I don't want to answer that [laughter] 'cause you don't lose it you know people have a lot of ideas and that's that's cute but uh you know we'll see okay we're all got\nOkay how about this how about ... okay how does this is a pretty easy one how about this one then church wants to know that he'd be interested to know the change in the audience for a drag race with more teens and young people watching has influence how you conceive and produced the show\nNo it hasn't you know our goal is always been to a to celebrate the art of drag and the art of the people behind drag in and tell their stories\nBecause it's it's it's a very unique person and personality who's able to ah ah change themselves and and to die voluntarily die and become reborn into another\nIncredible image of their own imagination there's something very very important there so uh know what happens is we produce the show and then we add the queens who are different every year every season and it takes on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag a in part driven by the success of the show may may have a change of the community itself that's because under son she wants to know that and\nSomeone calling themselves Django James uh wants to know what's the best way to tackle the racial bias issues that have become more apparent in drag race fandom as the show becomes mainstream\nWell those are two big questions after the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because\nUh in art ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is I'm a ... will never take cold because the ego will not accept the idea of someone changing their identity we're our whole\nCulture is based on a density of consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is and drag is the opposite of that drag says who now I'm this didn't oh now and that\nSo drag will never be mainstream uh now I'm you know racial issues it's it's um with within the drag it what ... what happens is\nUm we get a lot of young people who have ideas of of of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas um I I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with um the fact that a lot of young people\nThey gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show\nWill have way more a social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind\nSo that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this Earth I'm a I ... it has very little to do with\nBelieve we cash our show is the most diverse\nA a cast in television when we cast everybody in fact I think\nUh uh this past season without giving anything away well yeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little team because they who we have on the show um uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much [laughter] you have your token white folks with ah we found some but listen\nYou know we we cast the show based on the criteria is what it's charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast the show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just I've been resisting asking you this question but I just have to know a [laughter]\n'cause I'm a huge ... fan and and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that that that you you drop her from the show in that in that great lip sync between her and trixie Mattel\nAnd I just don't think she was just what happened there well\nWe we uh first of all you need and so Rob because ... is almost steals the ... the movie stars born she's in that movie and she does a great job in that\nBut the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner\nOr even as you played the clip of MySpace Angie she did one episode and became an in tune to Asheville tall [laughter] so futile um nobody loses if if you're on the show your winter\nOkay so that actually leads me to say something else that I wanted to ask you about because\nThere's been a lot of media coverage of recalls drag race because it has become so popular and it has really uh elevated the careers you know of the drag queen to appear on the show to super stardom level as you said but I think it was in a big New York times article a while ago\nThat talked you know is there a risk in the dry and community a little bit between um the queens who get to be on on your show versus the many many many who don't because you know I've been reading that\nAh you know people in booking shows now folks are looking for a recall girls essentially who've been on the show and perhaps not booking very hardworking drag queens who who just haven't been on TV\nYeah oh that's that is the nature of show business and you know I I've been doing this for a long time um I've been in fashion I've been out fashion I'll be I'm In now I'll be out again that's the nature of the business and you have to\nKeep your your brand alive

there a vote both are running for Senate in Arizona and this is a moment from last week's Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that era science are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection away\nTo that is this a flat out lie again either just classic fair tax except they turn on a TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people their preexisting conditions\nSo the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christ in cinema and the second voice was Republican congressman Martha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Mars and make Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the books that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people are finding themselves and how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answer is that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash a record and tell her tell voter she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is this the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance and you have to regulate the plants and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good\nUh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good of forgot how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a preexisting condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people\nWho have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full range of benefits that can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone\nEven if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing condition\nSo the problem with the Republicans have done when confronted with this when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about they not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they like that protection for preexisting conditions so they put in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people to priests\nSharon's companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen\nBy Republicans whether it's to house repeal bill that mix Sally voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley floats in an op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will feed on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people who have cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than you\nDo man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because I think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as as we've been talking about\nThe health care in this country is so complicated that even when someone you knew who says well versed in it as Jonathan Cohn\nTries to explain what goes about explaining the you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean it is the debate on the campaign trail getting to to that level um that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does\nUm how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick examples I covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly okay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb\nOf one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before Holly began speaking was telling me about their child a had health issues they were concerned about pre existing conditions and he collars Holly and ask them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this\nAnd how he's giving the answer to that I told your thing and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the Affordable CARE Act this official seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues\nFast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally no these are all Republican loyalists\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave his speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about preexisting conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this now that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at\nParties and events where this issue is just like on everybody's mind what will so\nDid she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general hall we had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him\nYes okay so So Jonathan code that's this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know against because of the complications of health care um it is it possible that no matter how hard Democrat hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P\nThat when a those same GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nYou know we'll see we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um ... as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there I confused people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say X\nStink differently you asked your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your house your words like cares more about healthcare instinctively people associate that with the Democrats now they\nMade you know they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about the dominating Democrats raise taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know in a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people want to keep and that's Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing and\nThis is a well I have a we even have a Fox News pull in recent Fox News full from just the within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare a gift and you know and if you look at when it did you know it did after the Affordable CARE Act became lied did after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\nDemocrats can draw on that reservoir of trust on the issue of health care and use that and I think that's why you see Republicans as desperate as they are and why you see\nJosh Holly and Martin ... and all these other Republicans you know trying to sort of pretend they voted for something that they didn't or you know and and using or other ways to try to get on this because it's a big vulnerability\n... I still wonder that when it comes to that moment of uh actually\nCasting a vote filling in that bubble pulling the lever what have you how much health care will be on the minds of voters at that moment because you know the GOP is running on so many other issues that matter to a lot of voters we're hearing so much talk would love to talk about immigration and about jobs et cetera so\nLet's sort of a color simply we can get an answer to some of those questions were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk let's go to Michael who's calling from Chester County Maryland Michael you're on the air\nYes um I think there is a huge called KM bluff going on by all the Republican candidates for Congress including our congressmen

issue\nMaybe on voters' minds as they cast their ballots are in two thousand Eighteen I'm joined today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering the healthcare\nSocial welfare and politics and let's go to the phones here because of Lance is on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois Lance you're on the air\nOh yeah I've been self employed for a twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety so I've been dealing with this whole healthcare thing for many many years\nAnd I I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago for all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama Care came into effect\nI could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount\nSo to say that the Democrats have gotten a better job on health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it I figured you know share ministry yeah ministry a type of a contract or live under Obamacare\nYou can't see a quick question is are you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nSo I'm kind of you know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle there there is still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to uh pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nYeah Lance thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn ah this I think is this is absolutely the other side of the major health care uh challenges that we have in the United states it and the people like ... are right that\nThat we still have the problem the spiraling cost and that the CIA didn't cover every one who needs assistance with health care and so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about pre existing conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\nYeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming of the Affordable CARE Act\nUm you know if you go but you know the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available was only available to people in good health and it had lots of gas and frankly the people who had insurance were not aware of these gaps until they got sick\nThere was a and your lifetime limit on policies on on on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill said forego care comes and says we're going to change all that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover\nYou know all the things that employer policy would cover and that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it\nWell what happened was in a ...\nFor people who are poor or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part I'm as income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and uh your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who's now facing just on affordable health insurance\nOr and is looking for alternative so the question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was you just take away or did you say All right we need to give those people like your caller the same kind of access to coverage to people who were lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create a you open up Medicare and Medicaid\nTo them these are the you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward\nBut it is it the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation Ole here is to repeal replace or or preserve it will be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternatives next steps\nBut we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them it's a simple choice either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side\nUh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they were all talking about everything from Medicaid by and medic I mean this candidate up in Michigan is a list is like and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't afford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders and\nMany other Democrats who say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this was a very active conversation is that really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans or lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading into me when he twenty presidential election\nWell since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that the ... act\nDid not solve that cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott because he railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act where they say\nBringing your costs for families going to go down twenty five hundred dollars almost doubled since ... co payments are up they send you wouldn't lose your doctor now we know that was his ally the ... century you and who is your plan and we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said he was going to do didn't do it how\nWe have got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions exactly the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional\nPre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turned quickly now if I Can't do Reid Epstein he's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joined us today from Washington read welcome to complete hiding so uh you know to Jonathan and Joe have been touched\n... ... is the pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail as well\nWell the thing to remember is that like for Democrats running in races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the the most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about the uh I was just in Nevada this weekend a writing about the Senate race there\nIn Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed health care and and the preexisting condition argument\nFront and center in her campaign uh the the democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions in health care\nAnd it's it's an issue that Democrats clearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen by the way that Republicans have handled the preexisting condition question are so many of them are now vowing to protect\nA pre existing ... ... ... previously protection preexisting condition protections that they have voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties\nSee as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay so uh so read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... we hit on it a little earlier but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then a similar plan came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the ensuring coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the ... if I have this right saying that ensures quote may not establish rules for eligibility based on\nHealth status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but\nJonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nNo and it's the same phenomenon we've seen before where it has some of the pieces of the Affordable CARE Act but it leaves out others it leaves out the essential benefits\nA requirement for example which is a requirement that you have to cover things like mental health and that you have to have full prescription coverage and again insurance companies have gotten very good at manipulating those levers in ways that can make insurance either\nUnattractive or unusable to people who have serious medical conditions and don't forget that you know a ... you know we talk about preexisting conditions as efficient Jesse's requirements on insurance companies but it's also the financial assistance that less people by the insurance is also the expansion of Medicaid which covers millions of people many of whom have\nPreexisting conditions and the repeal plans that Republicans have voted for all undermined weekend eliminate\nBoth that or or or altered that's funding for the subsidies and for the Medicaid expansion\n\nMajor funding for

J. just just before the break you were telling us about your your first experience at of this massive gun show\nIn in Tulsa, Oklahoma a but there's so much detail that you write about the justice one experience we could spend the whole hour talking about it um but I but I Want to just kind of fast forward to the key moment here is that\nA is that Charles your\nYour uh you are one time father in law are he ended up actually buying you know at the gun shy isn't that right\nYeah and I think\nWhat people don't take from that is that where I'm from Oklahoma\nGuns or a way of life and not always for the reasons that we might think were the reasons that we might read about they are integral to the way that fathers get to know their son yeah\nAnd in some instances when you're much younger that father might buy you a twenty two rifles so you can go on the Web at ... or you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something father we for me which was ...\nWhat kind of gun was it\nLike twenty six color big luck ... why did you choose that one\nBecause I was interested in self defense as much as any other part I marketing ship came later but at that moment you know we're talking about carrying we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding with lethal force is we're talking about um\nThe mechanics of self defense shooting a sense of shooting a and we're talking about why some people\nHad been gun buying firearms in a even as far back is twenty seven twenty twelve and what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I was not having conversations about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles\nYes yeah so what was he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms and twenty ten twenty eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people\nFeel that that is their right and it is I mean we have laws that say this and people are very very interested and letting everyone else no if you come over here you might not walk away and that for many is a deterrent\n\nI mean I guess one thing I was wondering is ... ... just before a un after President Obama was first elected we saw a a surgeon gun sales did that ever entered the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks ah it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right and this is the state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have what are called\nUh at the time or academy sports and you can walk in there and and by any real caliber of handgun ammunition and how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's this kind of a surplus and people can't really move firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was in office because a lot of people still harbor to fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and tried to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of salt right for this kind of handgun a and those while you know\nFictitious were also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do it does not matter\nIf what you believe isn't what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word\nDon't tell them to their face that they're wrong you're going to irritate them and make them mad now make there for your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out and that's where I was trying to take this conversation\nOr even before you know I I even thought that I might entertain becoming that good with a pistol and I we get stymied mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about\nYou know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir\nWhere do you talk about uh the day that you got home or or ... or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had had purchased for it you could you read that\nYes ma'am it's got a lotta Oxford comments on it um\n[noise] the day I got back home with my new gun still in its box set it on my bed and looked at it for some time I had an open did at the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud\nWhat I felt was something more like fear like the fear I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the being who was so Marshall he drowned the planet cast out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love fear the way I was\nTaught to feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police stay out of jail and stay alive I knew that the first time I lost respect for that pistol no larger than life just it could kill me or get me killed\nOpen the box and picked up the clock I was amazed at how intuitive that was the process of removing the empty magazine putting it back and wrecking the slide was it really that easy\nA person with a gun tends to feel a lot like Superman with X ray vision laser citing poll smash strength which is why telling that person to use those super powers will generally result in the person looking at you like your lunatic\nI point the gun at the white white bedroom wall and my second storey apartment and squeezed feeling the hard click the trigger the soft half of the hammer and an empty chamber\nI put the gun back in its case knowing that next week the chamber wouldn't no longer be empty and that this bit of polymer plastic in metal would no longer be inexpensive paper wait what a weapon so lethal I Wish we could invent it it's\nRJ young reading an excerpt of his new memoir let it being a young black man's reluctant odyssey into guns\nAre gay I you know I Wonder if you could explain to folks who are listening to that that X or do you do you showed this deep respect for the power of the weapon in your hands uh some\nUh definitely conflicted feelings about having it at all so how is it that you got from that to being a certified NRA shooting instructor\n[noise] I got to a point in my journey that I wanted to answer one fundamental question that was present it to me over and over and over again as a truism the truism was\nA good guy with a gun is better than a bad guy with a gun and I put a question mark at the end of that statement and wanted to find out for myself if that was true and us began\nCountless rounds and trips to the gun range to get good really really good like master Yoda on day go by this is how you use the force good\nYeah [noise] and and you did it\n... yeah yeah I did but your heart out Raylan Givens\nBut you know I mean so the thing is is that you have\nYou just you you tell in the memoir and you're describing to us now how you know in order to connect with your ... your father in law and you're just owned passionate really throw yourself in understanding this culture that he's so much a part of that you become as you said like you you're pursuing a jet I Dream\nBut but I have to underscore like on the very next page of from the extra that you just read you write specifically that you were preparing for it\nSupport for on point comes from the listeners of WB you are in Boston and your NPR station\nFrom home advisor

the new fall collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a check her body we're speaking this hour with RJ young he's author of the new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctance odyssey\nInto guns or an arcane just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association a I I'm just really what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there's multiple there were a bunch of reasons why the association was formed a protection to the the desire for self protection amongst\nAfrican Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about a African Americans and gun history in America\nYeah and I got the profile dug for the book you know so that was cool and heard his voice in quite some time it's been on tape but that's that's the message messages there is a responsible way to use this there are folks like myself\nWho believe that they should be armed for self defense\nGuns were taken from people who look like you and that is not something that you get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\n[noise] so I'm just wondering I [noise]\nI I hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of African Americans maybe there's increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps ... especially in recent years [noise]\nBut ah RJ did you ever feel like you were actually potentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around a question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was a legal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident speaks more to what the NRA should have done in an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like ... and like dumped Jefferson and the people for which that organization represents but in regard to me\nYeah gun ain't going to help me man a magnet let me\nLet let me let me break it down a I walked into studio right where I'm a member chaos you shut up\nAnd I have on a Black Panther shirt got caught you on it because that's what the movie's really about I have on the black panther ... what kinda stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have locks that are rated up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't going to be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm dressed and also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not ah I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go round is if that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around as if a gun in a room is not bigger than any elephant you can walk in there you're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say\nAnd that's not correct and that's not right but it is true it is a fear\nSo in the course of getting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist and I am asking questions and I'm looking at data and I'm looking at statistics and I'm taking account of my own experience\nAnd what I come to flat out is not only am I not safer I'm In more danger if I have a gun on my person if I have a gun within reach\nHey I'm thinking about your former father in law Charles now did did you ever have did you ever tell them this that that the the very same\nDesire for self protection that made it made him such a firearms enthusiast or even if he shared that desire you actually felt less safe\nA ... because of the fact of race in America when you had the weapon then before you didn't is that something that he he he understood\nLater later as we continue to go through this and later as I had my credentials as I had a standing firm which do you have to continue this discussion like we had spoken about I hadn't fired a gun but I also was able to outline this in the book with a use of force attorney here in Oklahoma\nAnd he had a similar discussion with a friend of his uh this attorney was white his friend is black and his friend who he was\nReally respect for four of and was Reverend about said hey man when I get pulled over and you get pulled over it's just different and I don't need you to tell me that is\nJudge me by the color of my skin I Need you to recognize that it does happen and to support me\nIn a way you can support me is to speak up for me in the rooms that I'm not in that I'm not allowed in that I might not ever walk into and I thought that was where I got to with Charles I could see that toward the end\nYeah well our Jay hang on here for just a second so many interesting people about this conversation uh or or about this issue I should say I want to bring in one more voice Tiffany where joins us now she is joining us from Cincinnati, Ohio and she's founder of the brown girls project to be a group that offers\nMakeup workshops and other activities for building self esteem in African American women and girls\nAnd she also organizes firearms training classes for African American women to anywhere welcome to appoint\nHello hello hello thank you for having me\nSo so how long have you been a gun owner and in teaching the organizing firearms classes\nI'm organizing the fire on classes side December twenty six so a couple of years I'm owning one for about a year\nOkay and so and before that and guns and your family\nI'm not really a I have a grandfather from ... Georgia though he's a hunter um so you know he had a old shot gun that he kept in the house yet five daughters and two granddaughters and we knew that what that was but there was a trainee know interacting with it\nI see so what what uh what was the reason that took you to buy a gun\n[noise] um actually it it it was this new\nI don't want to say new but this heightened racial tense climate and the area that I live in um that made me say I need to be able to protect myself and as a single mother or be able to protect my children\nDuring the Trump campaign and you know\nMy children were very very um tuned into what was happening with how the newer politics and they were able to feel the tension drive as well um and they were very concerned\nAnd when a Trump got an off as my son who was Fifteen at the time was very emotional about it and he he was concerned\nNow what was going to happen to us people were being I'm feeling okay to be more aggressive to say things that they didn't say before who are either they invade your your personal space and he'd heard all these stories what if somebody does something to us\nAnd him being you know I have a son and a daughter and then it's myself you've got to go I have to protect you guys and I'm like no way could that's my job\nAnd then I thought about it like how would I really protect us\nDo do you ... Hannah I'm ... I'm Sorry to do and I mean it up there but do you really do you feel now that having a gun has made you and your families safer\n[noise] um [noise] I feel protected I feel that if someone crosses my threshold I have something other than my fist and iron to throw\n'em I feel that at night when my kids were coming home from extracurricular activities and the seasons change and it's gotten darker um if someone were to approach it I definitely feel like I'm I can handle myself and and make my kids safe\nYeah ah ... what do you what do you have to say the Tiffany 'cause I I I I hear her and I hear the voice of someone who feels\nThat ah that the places that we usually look for protection in society government law enforcement et cetera than our fellow citizens that there's a failure there which is why she felt like she she needed to to buy a firearm a to protect her\nSociety failing us is also a reason why a lot of white gun owners buy a gun and it just to me it feels I understand Tiffany's desire of course every parent wants to protect their child but it feels like we've we've all we're all feeling each other if we're turning to weapons as a means ... means for protection\nI had this very discussion I'm with my girlfriend here recently who is in charge of a five year old and a three year old both girls and she's a single mom so yeah she's going to do everything in her

half\nOf democratic ads run this far in the mid term elections have focused on one thing health care it is one of the defining issues if nothing uniquely defining one on the campaign trail right now to one hundred thirty million Americans may have some kind of pre existing condition one of the reasons why the\nGeo peas push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has put Republican candidates in the position of trying to convince voters that they're protecting one of Obamacare's most popular provisions well also trying to end the law itself and voters are very passionate\nAbout this issue but how much of that passion will translate at the ballot box\nThis hour on point healthcare and the midterms and we want to hear from you\nIs health care the issue that will define or at least influence\nHow you vote what have you been hearing from candidates in congressional races in your district about the Affordable CARE Act in the future of health care in America and are you liking what you're hearing where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also join us anytime it on point radio dot org or a Twitter and Facebook at on point radio well we're going to start today in St Louis Missouri where Joe men is political reporter for St Louis public radio has been covering the very interesting race a Senate race in Missouri\nJamon is welcome to um point\nHigh magnet thanks for having me it's great to have you know of course the Senate race is between democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill and a Republican candidate Missouri attorney general Josh Hawley so how much is healthcare defining or how the two are engaging with each other or asking for people for their votes\nWell on on her side I Would say it's probably eighty five percent a I mean it's a major major focus of McCaskill most of the ads that she is paying for our about healthcare a she has been she conducted over fifty town halls over the last\nYear and a half and it quickly became apparent that health care was the big issue she actually started focusing on it before many other Democrats elsewhere in the country did I covered her first one about Eighteen months ago\nAnd that's when some of the star to now was a health care was the big issue for her or for voters engaging with her at these town hall voters engaging with her and what were the very first one in April twenty Seventeen\nAnd it was brought up then and by the time I caught up with her at another one a year ago in October twenty Seventeen\nThat was a major major focus of most of the people in the audience and these were open town halls these were just open to anybody not not particularly partisan and what were people saying to her\nWhile they were concerned ah because at that time if you recall on twenty Seventeen that's one of the votes for taking\nA in Washington about doing away with the Affordable CARE Act and while people have had issues with it ah people many of the public where we're getting concerned because a either they were getting their um health care on the exchange or they were concerned about how it was going to affect\nA the coverage that they had one of the problems in Missouri out out of the urban areas in the rural areas we did not expand Medicaid\nThis is the public radio eighty nine point three FM [noise]\n\nSupport run point comes from the

D D L E y traveled October [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about health care in the mid term elections and how much people's attitudes in hopes for the American health care system may influence their vote\nOr in these midterm races which we can stay with Jonathan Cohn ... national senior national correspondent at huff post covering health care social welfare politics man is also joined us Joe is political reporter for St Louis public radio\nUh and I want to play a little bit of tape for both of you here in terms of how this health care issue is playing out in Arizona I'm obviously a very interesting Senate race going on out there between democratic congresswoman Christian cinema and Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally their vote both are running for Senate\nIn Arizona and this is a moment from last week's Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that Arizona is are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection away\nTo that is just a flat out lie again either just classic scare tactics that they turn on a TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people their preexisting conditions\nSo the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congressman Martha mix Sally Jonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Mars and make Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many\nTo repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the blocks that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people who find themselves in how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answer is that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash her record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is that the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance then you have to regulate the plans and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good uh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good uh forgot how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a pre existing condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people\nWho have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full range of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone\nEven if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing conditions\nSo the problem with what Republicans have done when confronted with this when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about they may not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they liked that protection for pre existing conditions\nSo they put it in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop or insurance companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen\nBy Republicans whether it's the house repeal bill ... voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley floats in op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will seize on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people have cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than you\nDo man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because I think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as as we've been talking about\nThe health care and this this country is so complicated that even when someone you knew who says well versed in as Jonathan Cohn\nTries to explain what goes about explaining the you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean is it is the debate on the campaign trail getting to that level that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does\nUm how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick examples I covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly okay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb\nOf one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before highly began speaking was telling me about their child that had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions and he collars Holly and asked them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this and Holly's giving the answer and I told you sang and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the foreign ... this official seemed otherwise placate it he\nForward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally no these are all Republican loyalists\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave his speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about pre existing conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this and that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at\nParties and events where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWhat will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general Holly had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him\nYes okay so So Jonathan Cohn that's this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know against because of the complications of health care\nUm it is it possible that no matter how hard Democrats hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P that when a those same GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nWell you know we'll see we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um ... as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confuse people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say extra wide but\nHealthcare is one of the dishes where I think instinctively you asked your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your house your words like cares more about healthcare instinctively people associate that with the Democrats now they\nMade you know they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about the dominating Democrats raised taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know at a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people wanna keep and that's Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing and this is all we have\nA we even have a Fox News pull the recent Fox News full from just a within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare adept and you know and if you look at when it did you know it did to Africa Affordable Care act became ... after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\nDemocrats can draw on that reservoir of trust on the issue of health care and use that and I think that's why you see Republicans as desperate as they are and why you see\nJosh Holly and Martha ... and all these other Republicans you know trying to sort of pretend that they voted for something that they didn't want us you know and and using or other ways to try to get on this because it's a big vulnerability\nBut I still wonder that when it comes to that moment of uh actually casting a vote filling in that bubble pulling the lever what have you how much health care will be on the minds of voters at that moment because you know the GOP is running on so many other issues that matter to a lot of voters we're hearing so much talk would love to talk about immigration and about jobs et cetera so\nLet's sort of a color simply we can get an answer to some of those questions were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk let's go to Michael who's calling from Chester County Maryland Michael you're on the air\nYes um I

covering see a healthcare\nSocial welfare and politics and let's go to the phones here because of Lance\nIs on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois Lance you're on the air\nOh yeah I've been self employed for a twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety five and deal with this whole healthcare thing for many many years\nAnd uh I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago for all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama came into effect\nI could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that I'm Out so\nCare for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it I figured you know share ministry yeah ministry a type of a contract\nLive under Obamacare\nYeah Tennessee a quick question is are you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nSo I'm kind of you know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle there is still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to ah pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nYeah Lynn thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn uh this I think is this is absolutely the other side of the major health care uh challenges that we have in the United states it and the people like ... are right that\nThat we still have the problem the spiraling cost and that the CIA didn't cover everyone who needs assistance with health care and so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about pre existing conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\nYeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming\nOf the Affordable CARE Act um you know if you go but you know the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available was only available to people in good health and it had lots of gaps in it frankly the people who have insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial\nThere whereas in your lifetime limit on policies on on on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill for Bouckaert comes and says we're gonna change all that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover\nYou know all the things that employer policy would cover and that made it more expensive so they have they added these tax credits to help people afford it\nWell what happened was in a ... for people who are poor for for the lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part I'm as income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and a year colleges now sounds like one of those people who's now facing just on affordable health insurance\nOr and is looking for alternative so the question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was you just take away where did you say All right we need to give those people like your caller the same kind of access to coverage that people who were lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create a you open up Medicare or Medicaid\nTo them these are the you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward\nBut it is it the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation only here is should repeal replace or or preserve it will be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternative next steps\nWhat we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them it's a simple choice either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side uh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they were all talking about everything from Medicaid by and medical I mean\nThis candidate up in Michigan a there's a list is like and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders and many other Democrats to say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this is a very active conversation\nThat really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans or lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading intimate twenty twenty presidential election\nWell since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that the ... act did not solve that cost issue came up at a Senate debate\nThis month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott really railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act where they say\nPremiums your costs per pound was going to go down twenty five hundred dollars and then becomes almost ... co payments they send you wouldn't lose your doctor yep we know that was his ally of the century you wouldn't lose your plan and we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said it was going to do didn't do it how\nWe have got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott now in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions sings actually the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional\nPre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turned quickly now if I Can't do Reid Epstein he's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joined us today from Washington read welcome to on planes hiding so uh you know to Jonathan and Joe have been telling us a lot about what they're seeing and races that they've followed do is it do is a pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail is well\nWell the thing to remember is that for Democrats running in races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the the most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about the uh I was just in Nevada this weekend\nA writing about the Senate race there and Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed healthcare and and the preexisting condition argument\nFront and center in her campaign uh the the democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions in health care\nAnd it's it's an issue that Democrats clearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen by the way that Republicans have handled the preexisting condition question ah so many of them are now vowing to protect\nA pre existing ... previously protection preexisting condition protections that they voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties\nSee as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay to wrestle read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... which hit on it a little earlier but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then a similar plan came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the insurance coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the Affordable CARE Act if I have this right saying that ensures quote may not establish rules for eligibility based on\nHealth status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but\nJonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nNo and it's the same phenomenon we've seen before where it has some of the pieces of the Affordable CARE Act but it leaves out others it leaves out the essential benefits\nA requirement for example which is a requirement that you have to cover things like mental health and that you have to have full prescription coverage and again insurance companies have gotten very good at manipulating those levers in ways that can make insurance either unattractive or unusable to people\nYou know I'm ... you know we talk about things just in conditions as if it's Jesse's requirements on insurance companies but it's also the financial assistance that less people by the insurance is also the expansion of Medicaid which covers millions of people many of them have\nPreexisting conditions and the repeal plans that Republicans have voted for all undermined weekend eliminate\nBoth that or or or alter that's funding for the subsidies and for the Medicaid expansion\nAnd so if you're just you know having this this this this Republican bill which by the way you know who knows if they could even pass it out of Congress ... proposal I mean you know it's the idea that this would actually uh give people the same level in the same kind of protection they have now is frankly just preposterous", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "23"}
