and for Michelle Martin\nAnd we're going to start the program today at the White House where President Trump welcome to American pastor Andrew Brunson Princeton had been detained in Turkey for two years for months President Trump and others in his administration have been working on his release today pastor Brunson arrived in the U.S and appeared in the oval office with President Trump\nI just want to treat Rajoy because view of the system\nAnd to talk more about how has released came about and what this means for the U.S turkey relationship we're joined now by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him hey can you start by describing the scene in the oval office this afternoon\nYet so you had President Trump seated in the middle next to him a was a pastor Brunson and his family on the other side there were senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo all who had worked to secure\nBranson's release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees latest hands on the president and prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom\nWell what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\n... uh he had been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course um there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department\nAnd especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August he imposed sanctions on turkey to try to force the release of Brunson um that release came on friday a and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes this mean anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey you\nKnow these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be a pretty good report between President Trump and president air to one uh though Trump set it on a number of occasions that this situation with pastor Brunson was hurting their relationship I'm\nIn the oval office today and also on Twitter President Trump insisted that there was no deal involved here uh in securing Brunson released a but he did say that it would likely improve the relationship between the two nations you know it comes at a time when the U.S and turkey\nAre trying to figure out how to navigate the disappearance and suspected murder of journalists ... cars showed the\nUm he wrote for the Washington Post and was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul a almost two weeks ago\nAnd we're going to talk more about that later in the program but first what are the domestic political implications of the Brunson released\nPastor Brunson case was really important to evangelical Christians who took a keen interest in securing his release a and evangelicals are a key part of President Trump's base and one other thing about this that stands out is that\nPresident Trump has really put a priority on freeing Americans

from NPR News I'm Shereen Marisol Meraji in Georgia allegations of voter suppression or grabbing headlines and the tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivist they're suing can't because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications have been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this so we called up my knee see he's the government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program\nThat's driving me All right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact match law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty close\nOr Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending lists until they could be ... fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously\nOver this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into state law and so now we're in round two where the civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office says other states have this kind of law including Florida\nAnd in Florida any way of federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that they fly disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case you well\nIt is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nRain can running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does she have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to ... be ... his opponents say that Brian ... is part of this process that secretary\nOf state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these voters on pending lists\nAnd we have seen Georgia passed a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work as the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing\n... elections in enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote\nAnd follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported that Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including\nWell over two hundred thousand new voters just since the may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is\nMotivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on\nVoting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that Brian Kemp used\nThat was my knee the as the Atlanta Journal constitution Mike thanks so much\n... thank thank you\nNow it's time for the barber shop that's what we talked to an interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds and to a game we can talk about a couple of celebrities who got political this week\nYou know Hillary everyone but the cat\nAnd may need to know that the guy they didn't get to see my dad all the time like the guy\nAnd made it for like ...\nYou probably heard those comments from Kanye West in the oval office and the firestorm of reaction after but Kanye wasn't the only celebrity catching heat this week Taylor Swift was to for her Instagram endorsement of two Democrats running for office in Tennessee her home state and we've got a few people joining us to talk all about this\nTest is Stuart is politics reporter at Rolling Stone she's in Hudson New York Julia ... of the Hubble posted on the line from Washington D. C. and last but not least Rodney Carmichael from NPR Music is joining us via Skype from Atlanta [noise] hey everybody\nWho was the way he\nHas it gone right now I'm going to start with you for because I Know at some point you were a big ... fan maybe still ours um and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this was on another level and it was in the oval office\nWhat was your reaction to what went down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal is like a Trojan up the phone from get out or something I don't know I Will do for once upon a time you noticed hours borrowed krona you've been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the per year was not that much of a surprise\nBut as easy as it is to laugh about it and imagine that there was some kind of entertaining\nBring up if we go to the series the really dangerous for trying to ... that he is now and ... and a lot or was he the reflection of Trump or the candidate in ... Spain and it was really easy to laugh about 'em into election you know\n... ... what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously yes\nIf you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not doing this to be provocative he's not doing this to sell albums\nIt's very clear at least to me that this is how he feels he even said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reach\nYes fans his fans follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\nBecause I'm going to throw this next question to you Taylor Swift also got some heated reaction to her backing to Democrats in Tennessee up for people who haven't heard tests that can you can you tell us what happened what she did on Sunday night she posted a photograph of herself to Instagram and and the caption\nShe talked about the fact that she was coming out for the first time\nAnd vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee\nAnd Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November but the main thrust of her answer and post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate and the race she said she likes to support women who are running for office\nBut she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that black and has supported in Congress\nI'm sure that they're not hurt Tennessee values\nAnd high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so what but I mean there was a lot of like negative reaction from high profile Republicans there wasn't negative reaction\nBut it wasn't as strong as for instance Trump has been\nTaylor's music twenty five percent less now\nUm which is really like not that damning of a of a combination and Mike how come you said you know she's entitled to her political beliefs but it's not going to matter unless Thirteen year old girls are voting which was very dismissive of um Taylor's reach which is a lot broader than just Thirteen year old girls at this point\nBut what about her her fans who are Republicans just regular fans not high profile yeah it's hard to say because the timing of this announcement was right after her reputation tour and dead so we don't have a sense of whether this would impact ticket sales at this point or\nFunding also provided by payroll is a lot of\nBringing a taste of seaside Mexican cuisine and local ingredients to Newport craft cocktails

... in a one living in place that in the future a British sociology professor lectures her students about the sex industry\nYeah of course men was having sex as well but you'll remember from the reading what white males cold like they've met\nThat Sarah Jones she's the Tony Award winning playwright and started the show sell by date in which he inhabits Nineteen different characters a sex worker from Trinidad a former him from South central LA and an elderly Jewish woman from flushing queens what do I think of prostitution\nOr your shit was shooting the young man [laughter]\nWhat are you at Twenty years old age the use of my God are they go candies in my purse\n[laughter] and Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us and so we're out of here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there is a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are\nYou know there's a a man who's objectify women who is a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never up while I'm actually on the clock but yeah and\nYou know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst in value are determined by my parents and my marketability\nKind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to\nNow one of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags\nYou know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have ... on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as\nA woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as the rest of the culture but in hip hop and there was definitely the space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum\n... to sex and power in a male dominated culture mhm yeah I\nWas wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh it's totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quite right or I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accident which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods and goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I\nHave a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignity having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character you know\nI can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material\nOn ... the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and we said very good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit\nSo you know I really try to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture\nI come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American\nAnd we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of a pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is and you talk white you this that and I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... it's my pleasure pleasure and finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and I\nSo we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us\nI spent the first twelve years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl\nWhen I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was an identity crisis\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational adopt these together\nThe narrative about my adoption was really centered around my mom being a savior\nMy language my mannerisms my experiences are all in foreign by the white family I grew up with you told us you feel alone and want to know if there are other people like you out there\nYou asked us if you were a bunch of ... those are yours and ours by trying to claim identities that you weren't exposed to when you were growing up", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018",
