Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nThis is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today my producer Becky solving I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry there\nSome would already taken a hit economically but uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under wash them and that happened out yeah yeah I've watched it out\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links apple electrical in East Point together that was damaged now open to single lane but that said there is no a path with through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no very limited cell service and no outside help yeah\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the harder the or Easter industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... all the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also your shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most ... major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida Today and all this week Greg thanks so much you walk them\nAll right let's move now to the political storm that had correct Washington in the country last week he did a storm that has calmed down now Brett Kavanaugh is now justice capping off but the fun out from the bitter and divisive battle over his confirmation is still defining political conversation\nIt's for twenty reserves Rhode Island who says the public radio\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaborative meeting

station from NPR\nNews this is all things considered I Know for Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July President Trump made pastor\nBrunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's pastor ran a small church in is mayor in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nTo us at the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president reject type aired once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with everyone and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue of the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor\nAnd so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter just to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra dieting the clerk for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing his doubles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine [noise]\nIt was brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley he asked Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag or free throws had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to it a new price of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one\nFree does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns free to lay which makes ... in fact the vending machine Scott using the White House is all Pepsi products and all of their products in the machine got more expensive so we see they\nWould not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a note left at the scene of the crime to our\nValued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so there's always a wholesale cost the Fritos has gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that ... is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with well\nFood prices counts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just did the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma demo capital markets andme it analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nYou think about the soft drink companies alone when mom because the parent has gone up as well so because\nThe U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminium suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbout companies and it looked at coke and Pepsi or a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now sales so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking going category alive many of the other food categories and that allows companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat's good for him [noise]\nThat with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacy Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cats the\nIndicator from Planet Money for planet\nMoney comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their ass\nThis is look public radio we have the four thirty news update just ahead [noise]\nTurning partly cloudy staying windy overnight low forties tomorrow possible showers in motive to use the bite clear on the upper thirties sunshine up or fifty Sunday and Monday partly sunny a chance of showers low sixties\n[noise]\nListeners support for the public radio includes Barbara him the Smithfield support to from museum concerts or Rhode Island remembering problems baroque chamber orchestra musical boys some handled\nThe Sunday of the first Unitarian church in Providence museum concerts dot org by quest Montessori school offering an authentic Montessori education from Eighteen months to eighth grade in that regard it's\nAn open house this Sunday from all over the one question school dot org [noise]\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they were traveling underwriters says ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called battling cat his job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it\nSomething like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works\nPolar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line they've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operation some fold on social media in Venezuela pinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise] when\nYou look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of Russia and just random Russian guys going through and kind of fight saying at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they liked photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person uploaded photos shows are boy ...

from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since that report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases and abuse the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I might I ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today what\nCardinal Wuerl resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jury\nSystematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though isn't acknowledgement by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people in Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me that how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nThat with this completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecute crimes harder the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grounds stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two\nFifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church that they are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about\nAn institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world\nConstantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to\nOr how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on but the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique in critical role\nSwimming Josh Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you [noise]\nSome of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled the critical moment in that probe\n... succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to promote the grand

Nineteen Seventy seven that document contained a detailed list of the evidence the Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map at our office because it was just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the independent counsel investigating President Bill Clinton base was looking for a precedent for how a special prosecutor might send an impeachment referral to Congress\nThe national or let me see a lot of stuff from the water that that was very interesting what what I asked you to load that was set up to the house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the infringing on going interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nOn twenty first century variation of the Silk Road is something that lower team history likely considered\nSales boss on the Watergate team was James corals who now serves as mothers deputy\nBut he says unlike Richard Nixon Donald Trump's legal team is likely to object to any such material going to Congress\nTrump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has already signaled he would fight in court to stop lawmakers from seeing that document meanwhile the

fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also so how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known privately to that\nBut not with this public pressure okay so up until now fed officials had been defending said from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fat Charlie Evans\nHe was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these re\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes [noise]\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate nonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're\nA little concerned that maybe Trump's read it could be affecting that trust among the\n... could overtime German power ceases worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I

F. dot ORG\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered an outfit Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they are the heart of the Florida oyster industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise he'll tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these areas areas somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo we drove into day my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds up there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main minutes along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday it took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nIt's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast throughout\nIs and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a cause where the links apple logical in East Point together that was damaged now and just a single lane but that said there is now a path with throughout the electrical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in apple at school no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the heart of the oyster industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... all the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also your shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and the most votes escaped major damage that is good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida Today and all this week Greg thanks so much you walk them\nAll right

for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul had Eric\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church in is near and western turkey for years and years ah but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically he's always denied the charges that he had anything to do\nWith this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testify against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[laughter] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kid moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just tumbles taking up alone\nThink turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul we can take\nThe next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ten rules reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures and fall in twelve percent since ... so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns for you to lay which makes Fritos in fact the vending machines got uses in the White House\nIs all Pepsi products and all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know a well luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending\nMachine may be\nAdjusted to\nOffset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost the free does have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's all that's in a bag of freedom is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do as well food prices\nCounts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and\nTransportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just did the shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets andme it analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies I Know one of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all the companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now sales of so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what\nSex backing\nFour categories and that allows companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your desk gas for why you're free does went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm gonna go get right now\n[laughter] [noise] that's good for him [noise]\nThat with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie catch the\nIndicator from Planet Money what for planet\nMoney comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore transfer wise dot com or from their ass\nThis is all Frito is considered from NPR News\n[noise] support for the public radio include Rhode Island commerce corporation\nOpening businesses succeed with the Rhode Island small business hotline more at four zero one five to one help or our eyes small biz dot com by equally Allen committed to combining legal strategy with the fish absurd to address clients legal needs\nWith officers in Providence and throughout the northeast online at ... dot com\nYou'll notice something on the air on line and\nEditor of events are I PR is recognizing your ownership and our responsibility to you in our name the public's radio will continue to strive to offer olive Rhode Island in southeastern Massachusetts the highest quality public service journalism funded by you guided by you and accountable\nTo you journalism you can trust the public's radio at eighty nine point three of them and the public's radio dot ORG", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "12"}
