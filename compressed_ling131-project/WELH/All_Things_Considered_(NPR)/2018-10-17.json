scientists announced that they had found the oldest evidence of life in rocks that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures\nBecause the rocks in Greenland we're even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word they kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nPlaying at at that point from the ... in the\n... main such a lock on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they had found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively\nFew scientists have studied these rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nThis is the public radio eighty nine point three FM

the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that will quickly to huge queues at the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on a seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out of ... trees were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning on the u._k. in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big has\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are ... for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant from the pool so pretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock it cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red tape up the borders and that without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well so the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big\nHits ... sort of an aircraft crunchy losing hide she wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe and the u._k. leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that the euro skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario play out because person as a major destination for European ... so they were the U.S an effect on all manner of European produces whether some and they won produces in France cop produces in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export this nation foot will the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shock waltz it's true that some other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal\n[noise] the Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more the lesson to be honest I I mean we all questions why yes I think the ... will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere's another potential problem which is that it's reasonable to put his promise of doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to a very divided policy back in London and I think how she negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around is that common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure [noise]\nMm Mm [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake and a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent pile of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between Wilbur and its broader we've tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenue by one to two percent\nFor the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to ... percent which we tested apologies and involves sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to do better in the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to depend on the future and then the ... better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished uber more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they think they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer ethics and so you know we're entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and respects trigger and our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um that we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we've we've which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well\nLanguage but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his mind it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may have backfired a bit what the message that sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or here's your ears and flowers flowers and candy because I Do a take\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologized\nMany people thought oh it's wind up asking this question how do I was curious I think the main\nWays change with that because all my friends and my family and do that I study apologies than they are always ... I might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere morsel because people are always was like oh you're just you're not being with their paper\n[noise] knows how would you for telling you that was professor Benjamin ... speaking their Planet Money's Stacey Vanek Smith [noise] support from Planet Money comes from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations\nWorking to educate Americans not options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement\nMore alliance a lifetime income dot org [noise]\nServing in Rhode Island and the southeastern Massachusetts this is the public's radio eighty nine point three FM clearing out mid thirties very strong wins dropping out of the mid thirties pretty quickly and tomorrow sunny and windy getting to the upper forties\nSaudi friday and upper fifties stories in the five o'clock hour include new developments in the probe of their parents murder of a Saudi journalist and the chief justice of the Supreme Court is pushing for judicial independence [noise]\nSupport\nFor the public's radio includes look Croft academy it's an honor his level private middle school opening next fall\nFeaturing small group seminars hands\nOn science and daily foreign language class\nAcross school dot org buy orchard condominiums offerings single level two and three bedroom condos in a forest setting in West Warwick on the grounds to live WWW dot orchard all ride dot com by Brewster thought who broke architects dedicated to designing memorable homes and\nMeaningful community spaces\nFor Thirty years of photo gallery and Brewster ... dot com virus the gyms offering a fully modernized cleaning operation was perfect will force equipment for renting and drying of rugs one governor street and add rusty drugs\nDot com it's four fifty\nYou'll notice something on air online and at our events are I PR is recognizing your ownership and our responsibility to you in our name the public's radio will continue to strive to offer olive Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts the highest quality public service journalism funded by you\nGuided by you and accountable to you [noise] journalism you contrast the public's radio at eighty nine point three of them and the public's radio dot ORG\nWrestling and detailed emerged about how to market show the likely met his end of the Saudi conflict in Istanbul, Turkey will get\nThe latest on the investigation and look at what the international community could do to hold the Saudis accountable\nToday is Wednesday October seventeenth and this is all things considered from NPR News and\nI'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this hour we'll visit Florida where people's recovering from hurricane Michael are asking whether stronger building codes could have prevented some of the worst\nDamage as like somebody's trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone and I thought just hang in there and I said everything was going to be okay\nAnd in Boston Harvard students are divided over an admissions policy that's on trial this week\nGoing to be focused on something like ... create a third of division in Santa Fe basically for the sake of diversity\nLess what does legal type in Canada means for the U.S border first listeners\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm ...\nAfter turkey claims it has evidence that missing Saudi journalist ... ... was killed inside the Saudi counts within ...

marijuana is legal throughout Canada which raises a question what happens\nWhen Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our our ground beef out in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of ...\nThank you for having me on who you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the\nOfficer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied them entered based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing you rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThat arrived or shaking like somebody's trying to get in and the inside doors shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was\nHi save everything was

a long time a burden see management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle in many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nI mean this is a part of Florida that's what I call it the old Florida is not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all generational of Florida families any of them or just said that Trump folks to fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade and

one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that it's sort of a goes down

withstand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm as local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide is a professor of civil engineering at the

daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome\nTo all things considered Kate thanks for having me\nWell why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and religion and diversity and I'd love to see ... policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that race is sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the fact that a decision is based on\nI think higher rate is saying that they don't do that but let's insects admissions has been showing in the past few days and has brought to light is that oftentimes is the single response to that kind of stand\nWe should say yes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans\nAlmost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think of that argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed and at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and to lead\nMerit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions processes should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race\nTo stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWell ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at

happening stay with palm pay a visit to turkey just today after he was in Saudi Arabia\nRight well this was billed as a fact finding mission and the church seemed pleased that Washington is showing not just in involved in here but support for Turkey's investigation or there was a delay in searching the consul general's residence the Saudi consul general's residence er\nAnd that's what caused the foreign minister to say we need similar cooperation here but that surge then did begin today\nA Pompeo told reporters that the administration is not going to get ahead of the investigations and drop inclusions but he denied the U.

that is a lawful is\nNo no one is going to defend\nBut Palmdale at the same time make clear that the church should be mindful of the many important partnerships that bind to us in Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump is said much the same thing\nThat there have been some new details coming out today about what happened in that conflict\nGraphic tell us what this investigation has revealed\nTurkish and Saudi investigators did enter the consul general's residence today with Saudi permission continuing their search of Saudi diplomatic buildings in property a the constantly building was search Monday

recordings of what happened I'm a conflict on the other hand the Saudis are claiming to have had nothing to do with it can those two narratives really get resolved in these investigations wrapped up and just a few days\nThat is not at all clear I mean there are some suggestions that this would have to be a quite a long investigation to resolve the dispute like that and there's been no timetable given on this and a President Trump today did say uh we should know what happened to the show ... by the end of the week or whether that will actually ... and we just have to wait and see\nAnd what

that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should follow up on that [laughter]\nHer ... and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that ...\nOur slack of a better word that
