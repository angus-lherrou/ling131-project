allowed so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his\nOpponents are and and against the media uh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the

evidence in many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going after people so personally and and not just saying they're battling taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric mc ... it's very hard to tell a\nPeople's views of Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any

News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general parents are trying to see who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so there are something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\nJust goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law\nThousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role get no law enforcement activity no interacting\nWith migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car bear a barrier is more razor wire fencing of crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft in helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting\nAs law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they make clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah there were only to support role again and the plus we've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay [laughter] the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sit in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who is doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks even lawyers in public or the staff and\nUh again general are shown as he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq and right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's NPR's Tom Bowman getting us up to speed on the latest developments Pentagon thank you Tom You're welcome\nIn their quest to win back the house of

anything\nI've said whatever that is what I Believe so why would I watch it by\nThat same approach helped him winning twenty sixteen but Democrats like Maria Alina Lopez who helps run the party chapter in Miami Dade see that independent\nInventors and so he talks a lot that he's a moderate but when you see his voting record that it's completely not the case and unfortunately most voters do

personal connection is important\nI mean it's hard not to like the guy like that I mean it comes to listen and tries to\nDo something about the problem that affects the state and his area\nAnd um that's all you can I ask\nRelationships like that or the benefit of incumbency most challengers have to convince voters that they'll follow through on their promises but ... also worries that the people party needs to when people like those who work long hours and the service sector or tourism may not show up at fault\nIf we get our people to come out and vote I when it's going to be a close
