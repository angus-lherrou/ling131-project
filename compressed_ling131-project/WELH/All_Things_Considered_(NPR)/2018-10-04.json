investigation into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and you would never guess that Democrats and Republicans are reading the same report\nDemocrats say it is incomplete Republicans say on the country and we're going to speak next to one of those Republican Senator Mike rounds of South Dakota senator rounds welcome\nThank you very much appreciate the opportunity to visit\n[noise] let me start with a yes or no question do you believe what the FBI has produced represents a complete and thorough investigation\nI Do it's simply the next step there's been six earlier ones this is the seventh in this particular case they went back and we didn't tie their hands we just simply said you'd go back into the supplemental based on what a group of Republicans who had concerns that expressed\nThat they wanted to learn more about they talked about the specific incident itself and about other allegations they went through and lifted those out they actually interviewed I Believe ten individuals and and made eleven reports\nOkay that you're adding to our information there 'cause my information was that they had interviewed nine individuals so if you've yeah maybe they're up to ten\nOkay I think it was ten total ... well I should they contacted ten individuals nine individuals participated one declined to participate didn't want to participate\nLet me ask you about two people who they\nThe crafts that they didn't interview Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Blasey Ford\nWas because they both went through literally hours and hours of testimony before the Judiciary Committee both of them have actually had reviews before and so the the FBI had their choice as to who they wanted to interview and when\nAnd they decided not to interview either one didn't feel that they needed to interview either one however both were allowed if they wanted to to offer additional supplemental information that no one stopped him from doing any supplements that they wanted to offer\nLet me put to a point made by one of your colleagues in the Senate Dianne Feinstein who was of course the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee she spoke to reporters this morning as what you said\nIt's simply not credible to say that public testimony in last week's hearing is a substitute for interviews by FBI agents not only to senators lack the expertise of FBI agents we were only given five minutes to questions judge Kavanaugh\nSaid around does she have a point senators were only given five minutes to question Kavanaugh and ...\nThat's five minutes per individual with a grand total of probably eleven on the Republican side and Ken on the on the Democratic side and furthermore all of them offered literally multiple opportunities to ask questions specifically of each of them\nAnd I think in the case of judge Kavanaugh he literally responded to more questions in writing than any other Supreme Court justice\nAlthough a lot of new information has of course come to light since since some of his written responses came and let me let me let me ask you this basic question how is it not in everyone's interest especially judge Kavanaugh's if he wants to clear his name for the FBI to given to be given the space and time to run\nAll credible current allegations to the ground basically the agreement was that we would take a week and that during that time the FBI had full availability to do what ever they felt needed to be done and that was being made at the request of a group of senators who still wanted more information\nMost of the individuals who did not a plan to vote are the ones that are saying delayed again look let's be honest this is a political maneuver on their on their part\nThe advice look the story behind says is the Senate is supposed to be advise and consent and then this particular case they're strong feeling up here that Republicans are the Democrats Democrats simply decide this was going to be a search and destroy mission from day one\nYou're raising pilot ... and then they put out just on that and the moments we have left because distracted way me absolutely they agree that says about politics that says Republicans trying to get your guy confirmed before the midterm election\nOh I think there's a lot of truth to that we've said number one we would do it in a normal ordered a we were up to I Believe in Ninety One days now right and the average about sixty were about three weeks past the normal for the last five United States Supreme Court justice\nRounds thanks so much you bet Mike Rounds of South Dakota and we'll be speaking with a democratic senator elsewhere in the program\nI Want to bring in another voice now one of the people from Kavanaugh's past who has stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination Chad's Weddington went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight\nAnd that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath Chad letting ten joins me now Hi there how are you man I I'm All right thank you I your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released her statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me straight\nDo they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty to speak to a what I Know about like new three maybe forty five year college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job and that sense at all\nThat's chat chat letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News\nYou're listening to all things considered on Rhode Island public radio more all things considered coming up in just a moment we're going to hear about how some Alaskans are making the long flight to Washington or in the debate over whether or not Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nThat's coming up and just a few minutes here on all things considered on Rhode Island\nPublic radio but in between now and then in those few minutes I'm going to ask you to take those few minutes and make a donation to support what you hear on all things considered on Rhode Island public radio it's our fault fundraising campaign is wrapping up and just a few hours that's right this is the last day\nSo it is your last chance to get in and make that donation to support the news you listen to all day long I Hope that you will take just a few minutes out take a few minutes like Allison in Warwick who just made a donation thank you very much Alison for your contribution [noise]\nHello Aaron I'm yes time is a rented out to the clock is ticking to ... and uh yes\nAnd they drive is almost over so\nPlease don't miss this opportunity look this is a different model there's no question this is not a commercial model for news where we're not we don't we're not supported by advertising we don't sell products we don't sell\nYou know HVAC we'd has sell a home home construction you know or triple action powder that's not what we\nDo what we do is we try to give you as best we can what ... what is truth out or it's out there\n[laughter] and we try to do the best we can to give you a service right news and information that's why we believe in an farms that district citizenry needs\nInformation and that's what we try to do that look here's as long as we're being\nStraight with each other it takes people and it takes money\nTo do this and we're non commercial and nonprofit and these services are aimed at you and we hope\nYou see them aimed at the public good and if you do and help us we need to pay for it Ninety three percent of our budget comes from you we get seven percent of our budget from the corporation for public broadcasting in Washington that is it\nWe don't get any money from the state we take our ... our money comes locally from people who care about this kind of service\nAnd so naturally we have to talk to you about it because who else will be talk to your the people who get it you understand it because you use it\nSo we're bringing the message to you and we're saying look we've just got a little time left in this drive every person that participates during this Dr helps us out you can do it too\nDon't let someone else do it this time let you do it and then watch other people do it too because you'll set an example for them R.

O. J. says it's practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did and sometimes other parts of the government imposed sanctions on individual hackers or the people who funded them the assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched this cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations that it's athletes were invading drug\nTests embarrassed by that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\n... I was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the u._s. and now these charges just hours after Britain and another ... announced their own accusations against Russians is that coincidence\nOr coordinated very much coordinated the Justice Department actually ... international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in DC today they highlighted how the Dutch we're actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passports travelled ... the Hague and rented a car and then filled ... with electronic equipment\nThey parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition ... chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife ... networks there but the Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the P. C. W. was examining substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter and the u._k. this year\n... exactly okay\n... here's here's my big question which is what two these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic ... servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming mid terms from further Russian interference\nThe D. O. J. wouldn't touch that question ... day but there is something worth pointing out here\nThe new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the u._s. government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning that ... actually have warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these ... it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have ... motive as the Russian government allegedly did in\nThis case and pears Harry Johnson thank you my pleasure\nListening to Rhode Island public radio and all things considered we'll have\nMore of the coming up in just

nothing in this report to disqualify him but critics and protesters are pressuring senators not to confirm\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh displayed such a lack of judicial temperament that would be entirely disqualifying for any and certainly elevation to the highest court plant\nBernard heart court is a professor of law and political science at Columbia University he's one of more than Seventeen hundred law professors from across the country that signed a letter calling into question Kavanaugh ... ability to remain impartial\nThey pointed to Kavanaugh's heated and at times combative exchanges with

over his judicial temperament years ago\nThere are also problems in terms of whether or not judge Kavanaugh would have to recuse himself from a myriad number of cases that have a partisan nature to them\nHer courses cases involving congressional redistricting campaign finance and others Brakkton Booker NPR News Washington\nSarah Stewart likes to think about what happens when planets collide she uses to actual\nCannons to simulate those massive impact here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts of thought the earth's moon formed after a large coalition knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat is rock vapor and and what does that have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that are men grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rocks paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter]\nCrazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself well\n[laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nA amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the men\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to tests where we can prove whether or not the men actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the man was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today understanding how earth\nBecame the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how'd you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nThe kind of kid who was always lying in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nFor you is studying planets a fallback to actually traveling through space\nTo laugh at it I might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration\nAnd our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me [noise]\nSerious Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and to day she was named to the new class of MacArthur fellows congratulations and thanks for talking with us thank you\nCongratulations to serve Stewart I I always love\nA MacArthur fellows that's always such a an awesome thing it's\nIt's just I feel like those are some of the best and the brightest that this country has to offer and I I like the fact that we celebrate them\nAnd I like the fact that we celebrate them here on public radio because you know I've been I've been doing this a long time I mean I'm not even all that old I Know people get when you were young yeah I mean I I became a public this is an honest to God truth I became a total public radio junkie\nTwenty two years ago when I was in college it was my freshman year something like that so I was twenty three years ago now\nAnd uh yeah and I've just been a total news junkie ever science and I've been a public radio news junkie ever since I mean that's\nI I liked the fact that people here care about things that I like the fact that our listeners care about things they think these things are important and of course since this is a pledge drive on going to suggest that\nWhen you care about something you eat you put your money where your mouth is and you make a donation to
