B. S.\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new era gold\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really at President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not a Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis\nBut I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened and as you noted some\nQuestions about their their claims about what happened the effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder

think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdosed you'd expect another versus I I think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects during his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious ones we ... it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago his school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that\nBut he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe content that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them as if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggled to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really

college parents should send them with nor can as well as fentanyl testing strips\nJust like they would send them on with condom cheer encourage them to see first acts they can create like a fee for drug use cat for them to\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're in our student was planning on studying for their exam that having no testing strips and their drawer is going to be calling\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd then the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiative several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those on campus remain untouched\nThis is at least one data point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not\nThe hot spot hills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars but he cautions now locks on alone is not the answer colleges also need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose death he says is not the same thing as curing addiction Tovia Smith

portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house\nThat is new art appraiser aired Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale and she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome thank you a pleasure to be here I'll say\nHow controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art well I think every\nCouple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel dish Arab where he literally took a ... year no and hang it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what art actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment\nAgain we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is a first it is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller

many voters in Rhode Island governor's race is the economy and jobs political analyst Scott McKay wonder is how much influence a small state governor has in a global economy\nComedies or the streets in this country succeed or fail on what's happening in our inner connected globe\nSo long as money's freely crosses borders and corporations are free to travel the world seeking lower wages in taxes politicians in American stage only have so much economic clout rounds in New England states was slow to make the switch from other economy yoke to manufacturing to one based on services\nThe workforce is not so well educated as neighboring states\nThat meant that it was slower to exit the recession while the unemployment rate is near historic lows University of Rhode Island economists Leonard large ... points to a sobering statistic\nThe number of employed Rhode Island residents is about seven thousand fewer than two thousand seven just before the recession to begin changing it's grim\nRecent progress in reducing unemployment is largely due to a rebounding national economy and the grand accident of geography living next door to booming Massachusetts a national leader in innovation\nIf you listen to a democratic governor Gina Raimondo the states' recent economic plush is due to her policies\nShe tells her job training and wrote in bridge repair programs as full crumbs of more jobs she deserves credit for the road repairs the governor pushed her truck totally measure through a somewhat reluctant general assembly and has been aggressive in fixing wanted to collect the bridges and roads\nAnother Mondo initiative free tuition at the community college of Rhode Island is a type of investment designed to build a better workforce\nAnd job training Raimondo may have less influence for example some of the best blue collar manufacturing jobs are at the submarine builder electric boat\nThose jobs are in Rhode Island because they are financed by the federal government and depend more on Senator Jack Reed the ranking member of the armed Services Committee than on any state government policy\nThere is a serious question as to how much state taxpayers ought to shell out to train workers for used defense contractor such as electric boat the beneficiary of billions of federal tax dollars\nAs Richard mcentire chairman of the University of Rhode Island economics departments says quote we're giving away government money to people who already have too much\nAnd other dent in the window administration's policies is the lack of smart data about state medical benefits used by employees of large companies state law requires the department of Human Services to report every year on which the firm's employees are getting their healthcare from taxpayers through Medicaid\nBut state government doesn't know who they are because the state hasn't been collecting this information\nThe last time such day there was distributed was in two thousand and nine there ... administration has been ignoring its own law\nThis means that Governor and lawmakers are making decisions based on anecdote and what they hear from lobbyists and perhaps political donors stay centered elude the

B. S.\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new air called\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really at President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not a Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis\nBut I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened and as you noted some\nQuestions about their their claims about what happened the effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional teams who came to a sample a to providing a possibly in are the ones who remarks tomorrow more evidence of a direct link of these operations to NBS himself\nWhich then it would put further pressure on Trump's in terms of his response\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses for hiring where employers can post jobs and use screener questions to build their shortlist of preferred candidates learn more and indeed dot com slash higher\nFrom logged me in makers of go to meeting the collaborative meeting platform with over Eighteen million monthly users designed to connect people from anywhere in the world on any device learn more is go to meeting dot com\nAnd from listen like you who donate to this NPR station from NPR\nNews it's all things considered I'm Audie Cornish and I'm outfit Chang the U.S military command in Afghanistan has acknowledged that an American general was wounded during a deadly insider attack last week in the southern city of Kandahar initially the command described him only as quote un American service member\nNPR's Tom Bowman has more details\nOn Thursday brigadier general Jeffrey smiley was in a meeting at the Kandahar governor's compound with senior American and Afghan officials just before the meeting broke up an Afghan guards suddenly turned his weapon on those present\nThe guard shot Kandahar as police chief general Abdul ... several times killing him that he sprayed the room with bullets smiley was hit twice in his limbs sort of Pentagon source is being treated at a military hospital in Afghanistan committed a grant Neely an American military spokesman in Kabul confirmed to NPR the journal smiley was shot but\nSaid it would be no other details at this time adding\nWe will provide updates when appropriate news a general smiley was wounded was first reported by the Washington Post\nThe American commander ... did not release the generals name because of what it called privacy concerns the general was in charge of training advising the Afghan security forces in Kandahar the attack also killed ... intelligence chief of dull moment in\nWounded governor Zalmay Lisa initial reports from Afghan officials said the governor was killed\nIn American contractor and a coalition contractor will also wounded the top American commander in Afghanistan General Scott Miller was unharmed who was leading the meeting when the gunfire erupted officials say the Afghan guard who opened fire was killed and it only been hard within the past two months to work for the governor and\nInvestigation is ongoing as officials provided more information on the Kandahar insider attack there were still another attack on coalition forces in the western Atkins city of her odd one soldier was killed and three others wounded\nOfficials said they were not American but would not say which country they were from there have now been for insider attacks this year compared to one last year that killed three American Soldiers\nAnd they come as a Taliban has gained more ground in Afghanistan\nStill both Afghan and American officials were impressed with a large turnout on Saturday for parliamentary elections despite increased Taliban attacks voting in Kandahar was postponed until this weekend Tom Bowman NPR News Washington\n... [noise] um\nOpenly I debts are thought to be rare on college campuses but since the opioid epidemic young adults are now among those at high risk for overdose some schools aren't taking chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOf the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and what to do anything you know Ohio University is using this video dramatization\nYou not to show how ... can that Dr known generically as a lock sound can reverse\nOhio University is one of many schools that make nor can available

University south of Boston campus police detective sergeant Robert McAvoy points out one at sixty to simulator boxes on campus that are now also stocked with little bottles of ... all clearly labeled and read is opioid overdose kits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the middle of an epidemic affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our canon every dorm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you would do you feel those facts you can hold it like this whole to tip into the patients lost for all\nAbout regarding image down if the nasal passage given once ray\n... and then you're done that's junior Isaiah ... one of the resident advisors who've been trained yeah I did read I read it and I personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdose could actually save another person's life\nStudents like Nick ... say it's comforting not just for the small number of people who maybe heroin users but also everyone using other street drugs like cocaine which is sometimes laced with opioids like sentinel unbeknownst to users\nHonestly I say a lot of kids are where it goes that's when problems can definitely happen and then overdose Condes it'd be reality\nI think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious on his way of it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago his school is also just started giving free ... students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that\nBut he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe con to that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them as if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\n[noise] unfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to take it into their own hands\nJillian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with nor can as well as fentanyl testing strips\nJust like they would send them on with condom junior encourage them to see first acts they can create like a fee for drug use can for them to you\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if your interests junior was planning on studying for their exam that having had an old tactic strips in their drawer is going to be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and tried\nOthers question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts narcan\nUrgency cats contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd in the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiatives several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those on campus remain untouched\nThis is at least one data point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not the hot spot\nHills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars but he cautions now locks on alone is not the answer colleges also need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose
