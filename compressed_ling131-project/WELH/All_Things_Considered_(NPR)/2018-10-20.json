and turkey because a day after Saudi Arabia confirmed the death of journalists Jamal ... turkey says it is continuing its investigation into the killing\nYesterday the Saudi Government abandoned its earlier claim that it had no idea what happens you can show gee he was last seen after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month\nTurkish investigators said he was killed inside the consulate and that his body was mutilated the new Saudi version of events as a journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate NPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin ...\nThey note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to Istanbul the same day to show gee arrived at the consulate\nThere are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found the Saturday account of what happened credible he also said the fighting an accidental death is just a theory that's being thrown out and he doesn't want to use arms sales to the Saudis as retribution\nFor a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and ten million of which is a military order that

California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times this er Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for ...\nTo the story and she's with us now from London with the Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me now I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think it it has been shown that ice officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he has been described a six foot three and three hundred pounds and so those those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you describe those things you might not have\nSampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is do you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police are they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor and this is well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and Kevin between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental um health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected to issue their mental health in certain areas and connected to it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this was an important story and who um shouted above the root causes and story they needed to be told\nThat ... uh Kobe she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us in our sympathies to your family once again thank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when uh\nHis own home claiming he mistook it for her home and of course apple assigned is is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just don't into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't\n[noise]\nNo race West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over a position of African Americans and Latinos that ended up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the tip of iceberg for me\nIt's still end up his deal he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see what I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to fire the baby right traditions of citizens and police officers at what's lost here is that people taking the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on the video\nA video camera sets the stage for additional course contact for both the citizen and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the text to appear to be two white teenage girls and\nThey're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video is as a primer\nYour we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we defied behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens\nKnow what their rights are\nWhen you had a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and pick at who was cast in the ... I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that use that spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you let them\nLet me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights are I've thought put it in schools and making the mandatory was a great place to put it also\nAlso driver's license courses and also the police department police academy and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will\nQuestion I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both out we make certain that there is content that deals with the buyers ... how do we make certain that a police departments\nThat have psychological examinations or for that that a cartridge bars or an edge to just try to race is this possible the barge uh I'm not sure that they're sure that this is going to be the parents are because it's not it's not\nDot com [noise] also funded by west bay open studios\nCelebrating the temp the season today and tomorrow from eleven to five twenty artist painting sculpture jewelry glass and more west bay open studios dot com [noise]\nFunding also comes from the Rhode Island foundation partnering with generous and passionate Rhode islanders to lead transform and inspire our state details at Rhode Island foundation dot org\nGreat journalism comes from asking questions about the world around us\nAnd going out in search of answers so the public's radio is launching a new people powered initiative called the bubble or what have you always wondered about Rhode Island or southeastern Massachusetts that the public radio can investigate for you you can ask us anything big or small\nCheck it out at the public radio dot org slash the Bible or\n[noise]\nNPR comes from the station and from American Jewish World Service working together for more than Thirty years to build a more just an equitable world learn more at AJ W.

L. dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is role and doing that that's a conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges in exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and signed something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now am thanks so much for joining us is going to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nSo that program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve\nIn something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what do you get to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts a kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system store clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\n... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThere yeah ... that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to attack and\nSo they're all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipelines I mean the ...\nPipelines fraternities sororities they all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at this um\nCreating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's an extent in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench and heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nAnd to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find\nBut also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not for it\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close melts about it a try them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials said a generous donors were making your significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who those donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February the just issued a brief blends statements saying they were reevaluating it\nWhich suggest that perhaps they might try to reconstitute it in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks busting your shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the re boot of the popular Ninety show after star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the counters which for me or this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and I was just I'd be pro it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about so we called Sam ... he's the author of dreamland the true tale of America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks so much for joining us pleasure to be here myself I get\nAlso joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online Jeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did\nSay you know it's really interesting because any time a sitcom half actually address issues that are frankly a blast\nLooming in a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide be inside right and the struggle case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweets that got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there is a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior medicate or not in the real world says our culture guide though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI Know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the apps and services and was was powerful [laughter] so I I thought they did a pretty good job actually of addressing a very difficult topic\nSame I Know you're not a critic but you're deeply immersed in covering this crisis okay and I just wondered if you felt about it as a person who knows a lot about the reality is that the situation [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Providence", "day": "20"}
