favorite superhero it went on like that for quite a while All right NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now from the White House to make a complete total sense out of all of this hey I used to hello let's start with the why why was gone yeah even there today he\nWas a here because he is a big supporter of President Trump he and Trump they've been exchanging compliments for a while it it really picked up after World War the make America great again hat on Saturday Night live which was controversial\nAnd west had a lot of praise for Trump in the oval office here's some more of what he had to say\nWhat I leave Saturday Night live to approve auto it on the liberals improve on it if you don't look good\nWe don't look good this is our president\nWas joined at that meeting by legendary football player Jim Brown\nAnd and try really he talks about west in brown on a regular basis or because they are two of his highest profile African American supporters are and Trump's claims that west coming out of the port of them has boosted his standing in the African with the African American community\nAnd now Trump has an offered any real evidence of that but that's what he says and what\nWe'll mention Kanye West or Jim Brown and then he will talk about how black unemployment is lower since he took office and these other economic indicators that are better for black people and he basically said that people like west and brown quote get it and they see the benefits of backing him\nOkay so how about the conversation to even know what they talked about today\nTo talk about a lot of things and some of them very serious like investing in urban communities addressing crime and violence in Chicago and about clemency and on the issue of clemency and criminal justice reform of those have been priorities for none other than Jared Kushner and the White House\nUh and because of that focused there's some overlap with some of West interest uh Kim car dash in West or his wife has already been working with the Trump Administration on these issues she's been to the White House on two occasions and she successfully advocated for clemency for a woman who had been given a life sentence for\nFirst time drug than what was the main message that kind of us wanted to bring on criminal justice reform\nAnything to talk about publicly was that a about the free of Larry Hoover who was a leader and a founder of the Chicago gain gangster disciples who is now in a supermax prison starving multiple life than it says\nA this was the case that is different from usually the case of that prison at Purdue form advocates usually like to highlight they like to look at people who are more ... uh who have committed non violent offenses and ah who maybe got really

my heritage wandered just how easy is it to use databases like his to find people\nWe wanted to quantify how powerful technique to identify individual\nSo Ehrlich and his colleagues analyzed the DNA for more than one point two million people in this company's data base and discovered something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person that debate as it because that illuminate hundreds of yeast unfair that these so it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in these debates as to actually identify you\nThe same way that a GPS than you there's multiple that's I like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like we're person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course you need the geological records you need to do the work but you have enough power to to get very close\nAnd Ehrlich use the same techniques to identify it supposedly anonymous woman whose DNA was stored on a National Institutes of health research database raising questions about how ... the supposedly anonymous databases really are\nThese techniques doesn't only can get you ... you can catch criminals as these techniques but you can also use these techniques for other purposes maybe purposes that could be either to commit\nSo early says the findings raised questions about how genetic information could be misused\nThe police come into the using these techniques to find these really like you know ... and\n... people but uh we okay we've using these techniques to identify people that I don't know in the political demonstration to lift do DNA behind a wheel K ... if foreign governments are going to exploited this technique\nTo identify us to do this for their own purposes so there are many scenario that you can think about me you\nKnow many people defending the use of these techniques to help solve serious crimes\nExcited to see this demonstration that genetic genealogy is so powerful\nEllen great tack works at ... labs which helps police solve crimes is way\nWorking on these cases that haven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just\nChildren things like that is just [noise] things that need to be solved\nAnd great tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law\nProfessor if it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do a difference that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a\nRough few years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rates in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign since then the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nAnd I have directed the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave when the straighten it out on to straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there\nThis should be administration is filing a brief for the federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public\nTrump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk from\nSays the widespread stopping and frisky potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime worse and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in only really\nHaven't had any keep from then count now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore ... nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as unnecessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word is just his money and lives as stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more police and\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like ... and little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real highlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers\nMartin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew it alive those were the words from it in for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian the way you rocket carrying two astronauts to the international space station failed during it today\nAt liftoff had proceeded smoothly for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] um [noise]\nAnd I had five and my family out of the [noise]\nThe crew American Medicaid and Russian Alexei of shame in our space after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the PlayStation ...\nWe are joined my Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nSo this was going to be American cakes first time into the ... seconds for like ... ... what kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as a cosmonauts for quite a while as you say with space flight experience\nNick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched they might working together for a couple of years we've ran out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way the crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely factor\nWhen would be the next ... you could go on a mission like again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused in professional and doing their job but afterwards they're\nJust going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to isn't based today you know kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation you into that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again but I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong\nAnd then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem the manufacturing problem who knows\nThat and once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that in three months from now than no big deal but if it's gonna take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans bowling is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and when do we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they ... to come home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough chef\nThat after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them\nSo it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man so people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander of the international space station thank you very much for joining us today\nNice to talk of the also thank you

they are not telling the truth about what happened to Jamal could show you why would we believe them that they are not intentionally hitting civilians inside Yemen\nJordan the former ambassador says
