Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their has through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSee ... yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work during the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and step son has that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and the days are over them good old days are over ...\nBetween the golf course and his GM's pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nNot happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and you know we all go our separate\nI was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace policies that eighty so you're good today Don green is a nurse at an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scrubs a little\nBit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the healthcare field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent\nUsed to being able to ... to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was a tea do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a tease really you know that's all I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey fail here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired I'm just living normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain little bit and\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nThrows already running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead Wired's nights terror haunted thrill heart Peyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself has seems like a fantasy world or something or you know the current owners invited us into take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed\nSide the gate since that day [noise] drugs have him six hurting the freeway\nEnter our tour guide is Jeff ... he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility\nThe site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars dumps Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed I don't know if you remember this this little\nCircle Dr ... office buildings right there so we\nWe left it at like\nThe trees like the leaves on the street is kinda cool kind of eerie and\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing traffic jams fog and harms\nOur melts cars are driving by themselves and crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded

other law enforcement officers are taking custody of a white van that was plastered with pro Trump stickers ah near an auto zone store their family attorney says that the van is say ox\nAre now a criminal complaint has been filed against him in federal court in New York\nHe faces five counts and all including illegally mailing explosives and threatening former presidents as well as others can\nCan you tell us a little bit about the clues and the evidence that led the FBI to him\nIt was actually a clue from one of the packages FBI Director Christopher Wray says the FBI was able to pull a fingerprint off of one of those bubble light manila envelope so we talked about a lot of the past week\nThat fingerprint match say ox a race says there's also a possible DNA connection from some of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent in two separate packages those appear to match say because well\nA and authorities have also identify did a identified a Twitter account that they said belong to him and the clothes they're ah with some of the words that were misspelled on the packages match\nThe misspelling on a Twitter account wow\nLooking into his background today tell us what you've learned about him\nWell he's fifty six years old he is a resident of South Florida are you registered as a Republican in March of twenty sixteen oh here's a pretty lengthy criminal history in Florida that includes charges of a felony theft and drugs he was also arrested over a possible bomb threatened two thousand to\nA he appears to have really kind of struggled for a very long time to find a place to maintain a steady income for example he filed for bankruptcy back in two thousand twelve or on that for him he said that he lived with his mother that he didn't own any furniture his occupational on that for him that he listed as store manager\nToday had kind of the hallmarks of a climax of the investigation with President Obama the FBI Director the attorney general all talking about it now that he's in custody is that what happens next\nWell the FBI but wants to know whether it's the talk was working alone whether there was somebody who was helping him with this the last

considered from NPR News I'm Audie Cornish in Washington\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national\nUnemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nIt's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed Don Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary\nAnd you know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the has the each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to back off and about the auto industry and the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know is great and then General Motors just bam you know shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace policies that eighty see you again today Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing the Halloween themed scribes little\nBit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nShe left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift\nThe health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed ... did the ending of that marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent\nUsed to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and against any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like John Green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know that's how I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired I'm just living normal life but that was not the case\nThey just say when it went down the drain a little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nThrows already running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead Wired's nights hair haunted thrill heart Peyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face [noise]\nSo a decade after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself of seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us into take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gates since that\nDay [noise] drove him six hurting the freeway with\nOur tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility\nThe site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting has passed I don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr\n... office buildings for her you know so we\nLike the leaves on the street\nIt's kinda cool kind of eerie and\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant is now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to be union members picketing traffic jams fog in our in\nOur cars are driving by themselves and a crazy world\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross bar underneath and faded black paint you can barely make out the ghost of another logo United Auto workers and the name of the union
