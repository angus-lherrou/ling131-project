Supreme Court\nIt's not clear which day that depends on when the FBI concludes its investigation into claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were both teenagers Kavanaugh ... denies the claims\nThe scope of the investigation is unclear and has been the subject of political haggling ever since the inquiry was announced on friday NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest I've got a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today what did he say about having on where this investigation stance\nHe said a lot about cabinet but let's just focus for this moment on what he said about the investigation and Kavanaugh we've been hearing a lot of reports that the White House had been ordering the FBI to keep the focus very narrow President Trump today insisted that is not the case I Want\nThem to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to the senators and\nI Want them to do that and we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about this Jeff Flake is the Arizona senator who forced this week long investigation on friday\nHe said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts here the Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and credible allegations\nPresident Trump seems to be referring to Senate Republicans on this so what's our best understanding of how the Senate Republicans define current incredible Lindsey Graham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all of the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party\nAnd it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party\nHere's the thing that's unclear it's whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that Kavanaugh wasn't telling the truth when he testified that is drinking habits and other things like that a flake was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants the scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them and the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence\nOr that undermines what what Ford said and backs what Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell\nSaying that based on the lack of hard evidence of regional prop prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh at this point how\nMuch control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process well here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they want it to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThey didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward with this\nAnd

Rhode Island public radio\nCalifornia's governor Jerry Brown signed a law last night barring Internet service providers from blocking or slowing down traffic or charging for faster loading the law basically restores the net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going on\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience so typically when people talk about and neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever let's say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app\nThat you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal wherever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your a data restrictions but then count Netflix stored database restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nThe Trump Administration repealed the net neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now the California has gone\nWas indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nThe writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming company video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your Comcast that have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place and are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing\nOn so many things actually so it's on a political level California is an interesting state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nIncluding immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and things to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how goes California so goes the rest of the nation\nOr all the Texas play during the Obama administration economic powerhouse the counters the politics of who's in the oval office and\nThe department of justice in this case did respond you know attorney general Jeff Sessions said exactly that essentially he's accusing Californian legislature of of ah attempting to frustrate federal policy as he put it\nSo what does this mean for consumers and companies will this fight plays out\nOr not much yet the rules were not isolated to go into effect until January at this point the Justice Department is seeking an injunction to not have those rules go into effect at all in the meantime on a federal level\nOr the companies and the consumer groups and twenty attorneys general including in California attorney general are suing the Federal Communications commission trying to\nOn rules the repeal of the Obama era rules so all of this kind of in the hands of the courts are and we're waiting to see how that plays out so you think you\nAre listening to Rhode Island public radio you listen to public radio to hear the news to experience the world to hear about complex issues you just heard a story about net neutrality\nAnd how even can relate to politics in California how that can move the rest of the country as well you're listening to it on Rhode Island public radio and it's made possible through the generosity of our listeners contributors so please give now during our fall membership drive to get by calling one eighty eight\nNine six three seven four seven seven or online at our website ...

White House today the president held a sun ... press conference to talk about his new trade deals but\nInevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions among them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president assure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question well you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support cabinet unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation well all these machinations were taking place\nOnce again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year but back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan who sits ideologically at the center of the court\nAnd today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued a challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis she's lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral time that it lives and breathes in is gone a federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that at some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans after the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on is built of species you know you go systems are native species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along\n[noise] Nina Totenberg NPR

Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell promises that the Senate will vote this week on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court\nIt's not clear which day that depends on when the FBI concludes its investigation into claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were both teenagers Kavanaugh ... denies the claims\nThe scope of the investigation is unclear and has been the subject of political haggling ever since the inquiry was announced on friday\nNPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest I've got a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today\nWhat did he say about having on this investigation stance he said a lot about Kavanaugh but let's just focus for this moment on what he said about the investigation and cabinet ... we've been hearing a lot of reports that the White House had been ordering the FBI to keep the focus very narrow President Trump today insisted that is not the case\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nAnd we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about this Jeff Flake is the Arizona senator who forced this week long investigation on friday\nHe said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts here the Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and credible allegations\nPresident Trump seems to be referring to Senate Republicans on this so what's our best understanding of how the Senate Republicans define current incredible Lindsey Graham gave a definition of this uh\nThe witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party\nAnd it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party\nHere's the thing that's unclear it's whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that Kavanaugh wasn't telling the truth when he testified that is drinking habits and other things like that a flake was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants to scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them in the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence or that undermines what what Ford said and backs with Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell\nSaying that based on the lack of hard evidence of regional prop prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh at this point how\nMuch control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process well here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they want it to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThey didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward with this\nAnd you have to wait for those votes those three Republicans have a lot of power right now and that's why this moment in sixty minutes interview was so important\nIf judge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes\nIt's six twenty
