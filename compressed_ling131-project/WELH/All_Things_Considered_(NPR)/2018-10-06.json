R. G. [noise]\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the United States Supreme court\nThis afternoon the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on a vote a fifty two forty eight one of the closest margins ever minutes later the White House announced that he would be sworn in during a private ceremony later today\nNPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill it's got welcome thanks for joining us same show so first of all set the scene for us where people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so as that was happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests stir mansion\n[noise]\nCircles who spent [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order and the gallery\nSo that's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities and made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThis has all been so partisan and divisive but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate I think so uh senators from both\nParties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii says this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I Am left with Mr President anger Harry discuss\nAnd a process that could not see the truth of what Dr for I Try to tell us\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed more than I can say those who have unleashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed than or lack of any empathy over more sport they had put them through\nWell let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThey did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often and in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing bet Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believed that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr did they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday ensuring Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed to the court that there were no corroborating accounts more questions the not\nSo then we have the same result as Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill testified about Clarence Thomas a woman comes forward with allegations and the man she accused ends up on the Supreme Court to talk about sort of more broadly\nDo\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and

circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kevin assaulted her years ago\nWhen I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether for it a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet this the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she has done a ... as\nCountry in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... what does professor Ford want to happen now I'm listening she told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed\nDecision with all the facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I mean there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given\nA voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to be an important\nMoment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know\nI think it will because it has raised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting in November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as a new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe decided to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old I work at Jefferson ville Indiana at Amazon so on the day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film it center since it opened\nA about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen and I have a son who does travel ball\nAnd for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now then the weight the two years for my stocks to vast\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at us a film that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five an hour\nWere given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nMy ... and ... for the last three weeks I wars in the ... I started working off a store for processing that come from India you received emerged from those [noise]\nInto border and the inventory for making ... hours and no one would be treated we're going to be with me and got us in hours after November first\nReal excited about it because of their provider I Know it can be used to my farm in a better quality ... which I was like because I don't have to be looking for sugar full time job you're going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho do want to raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses and particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nRight so there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were before\nSo I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase and the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming any\nIdea why why why do they now so suddenly and why now\nIs kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that this conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number\nMedian income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four now that is a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is\nSo the contrast has been putting quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nBefore we wrap up your part of the Amazon announcement also mentioned that the company plans to lobby for a higher federal minimum wage and I'm asking you to speculate but do you think this is going to have an impact beyond Amazon itself\nI think that was one of the most important parts of their announcement at a very rare for a corporation especially for Amazon to take kind of a very political stands and in this particular case I mean we're talking about federal minimum wage right now is seven dollars and twenty five cents it is an extremely low\nAlso funded by the

in the trial of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen [noise]\nMore than a year later dash cam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life who are connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to for\nThe way you're fine [laughter] guilty of that [noise] we find [laughter] [laughter] what fire first WB\nEasiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believe Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting ... McDonald fatally C. P. D. shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer member like\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been as a stronger response as well from some circles people saying\nYou know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhat would you have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when ... when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting your day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke or the officers said that\nDriving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to commit\nHeart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the park has this report it on the fact that this opened up some you know strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released of this shooting the department of justice came in and and investigated CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen\nThere is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case that we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform look like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of enacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so\nWhat's gonna happen from here\nAt ... she's the host of sixteen shots at a pod cast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke and the shooting death of a crime McDonald she was kind of to join us from WB easy chin thank you so much for talking\nWith human show\nNow we want to head into the barber shop to put a bow and this incredibly divisive an emotional week in Washington DC the barber shop is where we gather interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their mind so we're going to go back to the major story of the week the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd we've been hearing a lot from senators and spokespersons inactive is but we wanted to see if we could broaden things out to hear other conversations\nAnd we thought who better to talk to the local radio calling hosted journalists who here directly from their audience is on a regular basis so we called Liz Redskins she's a reporter with Alaska Public radio who's been closely following one of the most closely watched senators Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski\nWho ultimately decided not to support the Kavanaugh nomination the only Republican not to do so she's here with us from the studios welcome thanks for coming high that Charlie Sykes is with us once again he hosted a conservative political talk show for many years in

Carrie Miller she is the host of NPR News with Carrie Miller that's at Minnesota Public radio Carrie thank you so much for joining us Hi Michelle thank you\nAnd let me start by saying that nobody is pretending that this is scientific research but I did want to reach out to all of you because I Know that people your audience is reach out back to you and Kerry I'm going to start with you because you host a call in show and we pulled some tape from it let's just play a little bit of it here it is\nI think that the Democrats have got completely crazy I used to be a Democrat I Will not be voting Democrat and there's going to go up altogether all along it's like we have tons against each other rather against rather ... there's some really bad climate that we're in right now\nI I'm very dismayed with the choice of kicking hearty Ohio morals character and also I think it was fairly obvious some proceedings that Kevin that wasn't\nTo carry a ... as you can hear here getting people from all across the ...\nThat's what the comments are falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right ah in the show that you're playing the comments from my question to the audience was is what's going on with\nBrett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking of from very competitive races in Minnesota\nAnd I you know I can usually predict\nHow the calls are going to come in what I Am seeing as people are highly engaged and it really knowledgeable about what was happening and they were calling with some unexpected things to say I mean you hear that one caller saying\nI'm disappointed that it's all about party you hear the other caller saying I usually vote democratic this has turned me off and I think that's pretty representative of the calls that I've been getting over the last couple of weeks without\nThis certainly what all are greatly and off their turned off by ... by the
