F. L. dot edu\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I know that chain when Brett Kavanaugh sat down to for the Senate Judiciary committee to respond to charges that he had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford this isn't that what he had to say\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nRevenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nSelf what could the consequences of statements like this speech for judge Kavanaugh whether or not he's confirmed to the Supreme Court to answer that question we're joined by Stephen ... he's a law professor at New York university and he specializes in ethics welcome thank you\nSo you get a sense from you as how rare it is to hear a Supreme Court nominee talk the way Kevin I did not know man have you ever heard\nSuch partisan language like that during her confirmation hearing\nNo I haven't and not even during the confirmation of clarity\nSo let's say Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court do you think that he can be seen as an impartial arbiter in cases with political undertones\nIt depends upon who's doing the fear I think the losers will not see his decision as impartial\nHe is now branded as favoring the rights over the left so in political cases so left will expect to lose and do attribute that laws not to a disinterested treatment with a law but to a political agenda\nI mean there's this ideal that a lot of people have about the Supreme Court that these justices that this court is above politics or should be above politics but let me ask you how far removed is that ideal from reality\n[noise] very far removed first of all their justice has been appointed by president of a particular party who\nIf he's doing your homework will be sure to a point to justice who will likely you agree with the political position of that party so while we have decisions that use the language of law\nWe know that the court's decisions the justices decisions are influenced by their political regions\nSo I guess what I'm really asking is how productive is it having a conversation about impartiality when impartiality is a bit of a fantasy\n[noise] there are a very challenging question and we don't want any charge to favor ... because of particular Adam is toward that particular litigants so impartiality is a very least means\nUnbiased towards the lid against that doesn't mean unbiased toward the issue that has come before the justice the justice may have very definite views on the meaning of the Fourth Amendment or the meaning of privacy and that is not bias\nBut you're saying even a very minimal understanding of impartiality even working from that minimal understanding using judge Kavanaugh jeopardized any appearance of impartiality after what he said last Thursday\nAmericans wireless data consumption has skyrocketed since for gi tract was introduced\nBought a decade ago smartphones or become a central for 'em to go work and entertainment fueling the need for five but there are a tech hurdles how do you ... your network that accommodates everything from streaming services to\nShow for driving cars that answer may lie in the basement of a UMass Amherst laboratory Lindsey McGinnis has our report about that\nOne way to reach five gee standards as by creating more efficient cell towers at UMass Amherst doctoral student Chris Merrill is testing a prototype for Silicon Valley start\nAt a desk here [noise]\nOver the summer is where they come through and clean things\nIn the lab he uses a set of special chambers to mimic the vast spaces and tennis typically\nCover this is a larger and into a chamber you can see it's covered at the same phone this was that big dome as a lens antenna\nAnd they're each on the back that I don't know if you can see there are a couple of different squares\nSo he's one of those is an antenna\nMerrill is designed as an example of massive my mode technology short for multiple input multiple out but traditional cell towers spread data outward in a single three hundred and sixty degree blob\nThe watermelon size prototype splits the data and to several narrow beans that broadcast independently multi being antennas have been used in the past for defense applications that are just getting their start in commercial telecom clustered on top of the poll the system would do the work of dozens of normal antennas increasing available bad with\nIf you have more than what you can push more data through it everyone can stream their videos or do whatever we will be doing in ten or Twenty years with our phones are devices in our immersive virtual reality is\nBut the data themselves could also be the answer modern cell phones typically operate at a frequency between point to an eight gig or hurts but if you move up the electromagnetic spectrum to anywhere between thirty and three hundred bigger hurts\nHe'll find what many consider the golden ticket at five gee technology millimeter waves these tight wavelengths can carry massive amounts of data fast\nAnd they've actually been used for a long time know attacking north Hampton company that specializes in millimeter wave technology has been working on military an aerospace projects for nearly forty years\nBut like multi being antennas it's new territory for the telecom industry\nOne of the problems with millimeter waves are challenges with millimeter wave technology is the fact that it's such a high frequency it can be blocked by just about anything\nThat Jim McGregor principal analyst of serious research technology advisory firm based in Arizona\nIt can be blocked by your hand it can be blocked by blowing in the wind that can be blocked by just about anything the higher you go and frequency of the easier it is to block\nThe carriers could leverage the same being farming technology used in my role as antennas to overcome the interference problem\nIn some cases they can actually balance beam off other objects so bouncing off a building bouncing off a window off a wall um so that you can still use the millimeter wave even if it's partially blocked\nTwenty three it's expected to go anywhere from four hundred to eight hundred percent depending on the forecaster Merle agreed that marriage between the telecom and millimeter wave industries is inevitable but the timeline for that\nAnd its relationship to five gee is far from certain\nPeople have been drawing ... millimeter wave like hockey sticks\nYear over year growth rates for\nAt least a decade haven't materialized yet\nAnd Merle is mind the road to five gee begins with those multi being antennas he's testing and the UMass lab\nBy developing smaller versions of the Silicon Valley prototype I think a slice of watermelon instead of the whole fruit\nRole is as we can achieve five gee standards with normal frequencies first\nEventually the millimeter wave start to fill in in my opinion I think it's\nThe best at an actual gross is more than five years\nIt's coming but it's always\nSo this is the way for GE and\nNot with a bang but with the multi beam antenna for the New England news collaborative and one's even getting us\nAnd you're listening to Rhode

S. but these chemicals take a long time to break down on the environment and that's why they are still a problem now and how regulators responding to this especially given the uncertainty\nThe EPA requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes and in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals\nIt's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that is about Seventy grains of sand in an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like aqua America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher ... is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his needs clearer direction from the EPA and from policymakers\nTo be able to explain to the public and my above or below sea level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon and that still needs to be determined and that needs to be determined as soon as\nPossible now the EPA is working on a plan to manage pee fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year\nThe Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding\nReally fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water also we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage the fast chemicals\nAnd we don't know what that plan is going to look like until it's out some time in the next few months so what could people do to protect themselves today\nWell the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink\nIf you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator or water pitchers those will bring the levels down too but I've talked to people here who still just don't trust their water that it's safe and they're continuing to drink bottled water That's NPR's Jeff Brady thanks thank you are\nAnd tomorrow we'll visit a New Hampshire town where there's concern that these chemicals are leaking from landfill into drinking water [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered on Rhode Island public radio good afternoon I'm Aaron Reid and it is our fault fundraising campaign we're here to ask you to support public service journalism and if I may be so bold programs that make you smarter [noise]\nIt's good for all of civil society to have access to news and information about you know what's going on around the world what's happening around the country what's happening right here in Rhode Island and Massachusetts\nAnd your gift is what supports that whether it's a gift of ten dollars a month twenty dollars a month maybe a dollar a day whatever the amount is a gift in any amount is appreciated a gift in any amount helps so please call him make that gift right now eight eight\nEight nine six three seven four seven seven that's eight eight eight nine six three Seventy four Seventy seven or of course you can donate via our website and it is safe and secure and the Web\nAddress is R.

that executing them and so incompetent would be unconstitutional\nThe past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided

has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve
