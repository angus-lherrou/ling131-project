S. throughout our diplomatic corps\nNo longer had special privileges but this is totally different\nThis is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who has a great representative for the United nations or another international organization\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from the other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa\nSo it creates a hardship in so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way that would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow figure out how to get married and they know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ... to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen he's currently a principal at the consulting firm insignia global ambassador thank you so much for talking to us\nWell it's such a pleasure to speak with you and I wish you to have the best days\nNow to our series on China's growing influence in the world\nThat influences felt particularly strongly in that in Latin America where Chinese investments are growing rapidly it's often said that Brazil provides the food on China's dinner tables from soybeans to beef and chicken those expert helped make China Brazil's biggest trading partner as NPR's Philip Reeves reports Brazil also has something else the Chinese want\nWhat you see this [laughter]\nPlaying soccer under ... afternoon sun again the and you'll notice the something different about this ... we're in Brazil you pull the plan is Chinese teenagers who've come here eleven thousand miles from ... to ... train\nMade you mean because I Want to go the my country I mean China\nThey work up to my ...\nPi I'm going to be up anti is Seventeen he's here to learn how to make it to the top in professional soccer or football as everyone here calls and he's glad he came\nThink I like the ... ah I Love the plain here because of the step by step here for for me is ...

considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of the teenager outlook on McDonald\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot in Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of the country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this uh we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for the something off who says invest it said something offices\nSo from my perspective it's really what did either they'll send a wide this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what that I ... and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some time that we as saying that it's dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most pressing yes we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer and meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas the handling and all persons with mental illness so it's not the topic violations ... and ... no longer than\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this [noise] I mean you're saying\nThat they're premeditated by what kind of of acts doors as it if it were\nThe people who hosts the police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out the to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years since the onset policing United States so when when you put the two together the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus it during event then you have to cut the stuff that's out on\nSo if somebody's looking at let's say\nThe the than the steps of a Supreme Court\nYou think police officers pushing back the demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers identify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that the Democratic and gangs\nSo it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because it kind of take your and get out to get on a given politics and instead you you're doing it against a\nDo it but then the from the government with the police us\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of\nPolice violence against citizens in the cases of police officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with this\n... when we're looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are that part of the I was on top meant that activity if it is definitely\nA threatening to sue office so it's like when they sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment you benefit and political development that might be putting their lives in danger so this technically is how we approach and the ... and how you go to the house or well you know that it's a fast that quiz armed and dangerous\nBut I mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you had a thing sounded police agency you cannot Institute stand up for recruitment stand up for training which would certainly help us make gay the negative perception of of policing as a profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one ear are killed in that line of duty as an outcome most amended they detected because it was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept a nine police office in one yeah in separate incidents killed by members of the ... can accept\nThat as Maria haven't felt she is a professor
