Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise]\nYou know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he's a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district the votes I Need to\nWin this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to

by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nLove is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly why I'm working when I filled\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slower to describe predominantly black countries\nDuring the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation that stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nTo do I'm judge based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing a boat for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this each other and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates likely Adams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey are calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderate ships party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back\nPower got Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city [noise] procedures\nBut public radio eighty nine point three effort out it's for forty four in their second debate last night Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker out his Democratic challenger Jay ... disagreed about a lot of things transportation education health care and how to pay for it all bought\nTheir biggest disagreement was over the governor's support for fellow Republican Jeff deal the challenger to Massachusetts US Senator Elizabeth Warren and political reporter apathy Brooks has more about that [noise]\nI make the tougher friday coming up tonight on point to the Trump Administration wants pharma companies to

debate from Anthony Brooks it was the most contentious moment in last night's debate sponsored by W GBH the moderators asked Baker about a pledge he made a while ago to support the entire Republican ticket which would include Jeff deal\nDeal co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts so this has prompted a bit of a balancing act for bake a moderate Republican with a number of liberal positions who did not vote for Trump Gonzales had a question for the governor\nIs going to vote for just deal [noise] governor I'm going to vote for me and I'm going to vote for Karen polio and I'm going to vote for a series of other candidates as well I don't know what I'm going to do respect for that one I don't know if you're gonna vote for the guardian endorsed decision\nThis provided an opening for Gonzales who has been trying to link the popular governor with deal and by extension to Donald Trump Gonzales press the governor saying vote for deal is a vote against women's rights abortion and algae Beatty writes all of which the governor supports\nLet's be clear Jeff deal is the chair of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts seem to be a rubber stamp for Donald Trump select agenda and he would do everything in his power to under cut these very rights that you say you support and you say you're clear on your position\nIt sounds like you're clear and asking the people that states that sent Jeff deal to the United States Senate\nI'm very clear in my position on these issues and I've worked very hard on them here in Massachusetts and I'm going to continue to work hard on him here in Massachusetts\nIt was an awkward moment for Baker\nWhen he amended his statements suggesting to reporters that he would vote for deal\nThat simply misspoke but I'm going to vote for the ticket and I think it's interesting that um my opponents of so much time talking about the U.S Senate race and so little time talking about the race for governor\nWhen Gonzalez spoke to reporters he said the governor is trying to have it both ways he can't say he is for a a woman's right to choose for algae tiki rights and then asked the people in Massachusetts to support Jeff deal and then waffle on whether or not he's going to support Jeff deal where does he stand\nThis was the sharpest disagreement last night but not the only one as they did in their last debate the two sparred about how to improve public transportation education and healthcare\nThey offer contrasting visions of state government perhaps the best illustrated by their views on healthcare Gonzales favors moving to a single payer system which he says would cost less and do more\nIf we do it thoughtfully we will get make sure everybody has access to the health care services they need we will save money and we will radically simplify the system and the system we have today is not working for people and it is not financially sustainable\nBut Baker says there is no evidence that a single payer system would work here and he points to Vermont which tried and failed to set one up he calls Gonzales his plan a hugely expensive case of trust me\nAnd most people in Massachusetts while they all have issues and concerns about the health care systems they think the health care that they get is appropriately among the very best you're going to find anywhere and way of turn the whole system upside down for that I just don't understand\nBaker favors are cautious approach that could include a new effort to bring down the price of prescription drugs but he keep the current system intact Gonzales advocates

malls are emptying out others are bustling according to the international council of shopping centers\nOver the last five years more malls have opened and closed mark ... as a former CEO of Sears Canada he now teaches at Columbia Business school\nHe told me some malls will actually benefit from all those Sears stores shutting down\nThere are AAA or super regionals as they refer to who are booming who are receiving the news of Sears demise or near demise with Lee because if Sears is still doing business in in their facility they're happy to take the space back\nThese are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully tentative and they're only\nSo they're losing one anchor star but they've got others American what would they do it to share space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort okay and then there are B and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older\nIn many cases they've already lost his ears\nAnd the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the top tier miles by can't they re imagine the space and out of food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can't manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are striving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them to pay me a little bit more of a picture of what does look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states and they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community

sensors that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by customers\nIt sounds as though you're describing a landscape in which some malls are disappearing some malls are thriving but all of them are being re imagined in what ways where if you will an anchor store be as important as it was a generation ago people rethinking outdoor versus indoor spaces what trends are you seeing\nWill the egg restore was typically a department store in the department stores genre is for the most part on its way out\nBut now several things have happened first of all the power all an accessory trends have declined uh customers are spending an enormous amount of disposable income on\nTech and on experiential opportunities rather than on amassing wardrobe sort of a close\nAnd the whole idea that an over large box will act as the draw for a mall\nIs probably outmoded as well and many of the triple a malls or so to speak the anchor tenant as someone like the apple store my which doesn't occupy a traditional acres space but draws an enormous amount of traffic into the center [noise]\nDo you go shopping malls regularly\nNo fly when I was a gainfully employed in the business I did that two and three times a week everywhere in the United states and Canada\nBut frankly um they're they're less and less attractive they offer

the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times knows instead DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity of thing how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNelson says home DNA tests or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't design them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right out of there are also um profit making entity\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have
