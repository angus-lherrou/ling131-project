Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week to go before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic and his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose how dull hey our first just fact checked for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually that Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nVery vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order most legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration in this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U. S. is unusual but it is not unique there are over thirty countries that have also have birthright citizenship mostly they are in the western hemisphere including Canada Mexico Brazil Argentina but we

Know for Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro black women vote in large numbers and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party or co started Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energize\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country how do you do you go around and you have all the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers\nPolitical organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election I think the trust was\nBy the women's march I had to have that show and that is called [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works and communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activists\nWhat is it as you can see he's ... he's the entire labor family we show what is\nWhat why why\nWe only and that\nList of issues important black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and ... we had a stronger voice there's would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing to\nMe I actually Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well I get up relationships in the middle of it because I was in the ... the other police officers say something\nLive well he fits the profile\nAnd I'm like my dad used to my brother's history there are all star game we use ...\nEvery man in the pros but these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as a relief to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American a minute\nThe Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWhat the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire was there are several organizations that are not a CBC or directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day that the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that\nCalifornia

is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I know that shank let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate and a legit scheme intended to make Mahler look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either I first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's office as you know it's usually very tight lipped in but I did decide to speak about this uh and it says\nAnd the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence other than a earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual alleged that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Muller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working I\nSee okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yes the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this\nCould be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy Berkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember\nA around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six in a a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you\nThank you Ebola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months\nMore than two hundred forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's and every item and explains why this outbreak has proven difficult to end\nLast month the regime out yet found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nYou had an Iraqi ... P A young some rock station had empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator at these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home on this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child enough on just stepped on a boy is seven\nI guess as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the teen arrived\nAt first people were just watching as a team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\n... loan fought the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn coming on to some Vermont to be\nYou're trying not to look like are rushing because showing here will provoke the crown you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people in scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with international crisis group\nLocal populations very distrustful of the government\nEven though this part of the DR see a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor many believe the ruling authorities only care about exploring the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not of the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even you know whether they're true your motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he pulled the responders are forced to hunker down\nAnd includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security and they operate zone but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence NTR see\nSo it's very unlikely that peacekeepers in the outbreak zone right now the UN's main focus and the deer see our elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear that the un has to shift its pieces on the chessboard\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...

at Colorado State capital for the past year\nIn March one member of the general assembly was voted out of office by his peers but others hung on to their seats even after allegations against him were

not want to because they don't want it played out in the\nMedia on the campaign trail neither candidate is going out of their way to talk about their role in the me too movement or sexual harassment winter voted to expel a member of the house while marching if he meant I could voted to keep a different senator who was accused of sexual harassment and she stands by that but\nThere was too much reasonable doubt and not enough credible evidence there\nThe senator Republican Randy bum Gardner denied the allegations that he grabbed and slapped staffers buttocks twice and twenty sixteen yet an

learn more at Jones Day dot com\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. ios Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose how dull hey our first just fact checked for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tells what people are saying\nRepublican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMore than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating cook like this or more than a decade and now they got a president in an office who apparently goes fixated on this as\nWell if President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico no question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration in this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S is out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U.S is unusual but it is not unique there are over thirty countries that have also have birthright citizenship mostly they are in the western hemisphere including

Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women at our jobs\nThat we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country how did you go around ended up leaving the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and\nHealthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election I think that the threat was\nBy the women's march I had a show and that is called [laughter]\nGod that from this is Michelle mealy she works and communications\nWhite women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly as opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama it was was black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it as you can see he's ... he's the editor labor family we show what is your\nWife oh well you\nKnow\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including ... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice every election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to\n... we had a stronger voice\nThere's would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing ...\nI asked you Williams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well\nGet religious in the middle of it because I was in the ... the other police officers say something\nLife whole the whole ...\nAnd I'm like my dad is six to my brothers they were all star game we use ...\nLike every man and the ...\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything would be a Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and in and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman ... right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd so black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to\nCredit establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus has unpack\nWhat the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country this is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and
