considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we're going to return to a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it\nBut the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd dump ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both\nHere's yes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony\nAnd I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something that I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me\nBecause I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went I I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came up there and said hey go outside and look through the basement window\nTo about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so\nThe kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off\nMany he he took her panties off and then he he pulled on his pants and he went on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumped up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys are the party started touching another young woman who\nWas also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later a she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was\nWhen the lights were out everybody wants touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think that the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault\n[noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nAh [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece a sink struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know\nI I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't know I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh\nI think that should be part of it\n[noise] how did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well let let me tell you when I originally told my wife\nI told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my participation she didn't know that to this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good\nAnd how did you explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive\nOn their dad you know that can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the\nIn the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think would happen now and he said everybody at that window would have had their phones out videotaping it\nHas to take too but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be on film\nYou say yeah we film everything you know what they were kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there are there are days when I regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did you know my kids\nShowed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time some of it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this a lot of women ah said ah\nThey were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a assaulted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if either help these women then but I didn't do it dumps hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend shriek Adams\nEither [laughter]\nGr Ruth was acquitted of first degree murder and supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planting the murder carried out by a hit man\nShe was able to deliver the child named chancellor but she died weeks later gr Ruth was sentenced to more than two dozen years in prison but with time served he's scheduled to be released tomorrow from Sampson correctional institution in Clinton North Carolina\nScott sour has been covering the story for nearly two decades with the Charlotte Observer and he's just released a seven part report in a pod cast about Ruth the murder and the aftermath it's called careers and it's got power is with us now from Charlotte Scott thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me and my show really appreciate it now it's my understanding is that you you never talked with him after the the murder but he authorized his attorney to speak with you it's my understanding from your reporting that too\nMurder he says it was a drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a cow or not to kill her that he thought that van Brett Watkins is trying to kill him and he left the scene but that he didn't do anything it's about is that about right\nYes van Brett Watkins was the hit man that proof hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shooting sort of situation\nAnd truth yes I have spoken to him on the phone for about twenty minutes but off the record so it helped inform my reporting some but\nIt was ultimately his attorney who who I'm most recently spoke to for the the ...\nAlso comes from the Rhode Island public transportation authority with a mission to provide safe
