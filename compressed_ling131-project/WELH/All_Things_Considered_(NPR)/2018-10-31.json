NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be re focusing more on its roots back you're in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defending country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders\nAnd what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country is attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume this fictitious invader is Russia an earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the eastern and now it seems to be NATO stir\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like a Cold War is there talk of that their Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on

fact that she doesn't care about your house she cares about the White House\nAnd here's Warren attacking deal as the guy who's promised to have Donald Trump's back in Washington he's also\nEmbrace their tax plan that has Republicans calling say they're going to pay for by cutting Social Security and Mr Dale says he wants to be with Donald Trump a hundred percent of the time\nDeal co chaired

challenger and the Democratic incumbent starting with the first question\nDoes President Trump's divisive rhetoric help incite violence including the recent attempted mail bomb attacks and the shooting massacre the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nDeal blamed pockets of deep seated hatred and didn't mention the president but he did criticize war and for some of her heated rhetoric\nFor example a year ago health care was being debated by saying that Republicans want and this is a quote blood money from the American people at a time when Congress in school he's had been shot by us

discourse on President Trump\nUltimately the responsibility for the person who commits violence wise for the person who commits the violence that Donald Trump is not making things better when he does a tax on the free press when he tries to turn people against people\nWarren and deal clashed on a number of issues including taxes and presented to radically different views of government and how it's working or not working for war and it's bad news Republican tax cuts benefit billionaires in corporations at the expense of working people we live in\nAmerica for opportunities for the middle class are shrinking their growing only that that is the top and that's what I fight back\nIn warns view the economic ...\nBut the Republicans it's continuing to drain by contrast deals sees the glass half full and filling up thanks to Republican policies including their trillion and a half dollar tax cuts which he says is helping Massachusetts\nThe fact that matters more people in Massachusetts are

China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means to the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president's so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nThe sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary ...\nIt's actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on and late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're an falls it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they're selling it and buy dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ... percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S the we couldn't the un well partly counteracted\nTrump is so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which launched their impact Lim says the falling you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to violence and below project\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like what you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you failed to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist\nStacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast brings us this story about life on China's list of ... trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China in one day he went online to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing\nYou put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf underground and they'd say than the person is on the uh unprecedented list from the cart\nBloodline was confused why couldn't he broke the strength to get you started looking into the situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loved one has landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nJulie ... one thing that comes along with the blacklist unpleasant words they live on that uh you're fired from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speeding train you can fly\nAs a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this was involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans you couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud long went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town you discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face like up on a big billboard\nOr not like you're more than be electric ... by the side of the ...\nThere are like huge screens and they're very eye catching you can't really see them from afar and I saw my my pictures and that's why it's like a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is untrustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town\nShe says whenever he went out whenever he'd see the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that he saw the face of someone he knew\nOr on every ... oh my God this or ... in the same industry as I did ... now they're\nLoud started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist he started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to he started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around about what does\nIt does actually friday the widespread attitude towards us is very resistant and people were saying why are you you're being happy why do you still have time to be happy or why do you not to go out and make money to pay back\nYour loan so far large wants as you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard\nWe talked to ... and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt well it's technically possible\nBut it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says she will keep paying off his debts she has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR

Journal of medicine same minimally invasive surgery is actually worse for women than standard surgery now doctors are starting to shy away from it NPR's Richard Harris reports\nEarly cervical cancer is often treated with surgical removal of the disease uterus new techniques called minimally invasive surgery started becoming popular among doctors in two thousand six doctor Pedro Ramirez said Andy Anderson Cancer Center says instead of one large incision\nIt will be performed through very small incision is in the abdomen where instruments are introduced in through the abdomen through those ...\nRamirez and his colleagues decided to compare those two approaches six hundred women in total volunteered for this worldwide study overseers stop the study early after noticing a significant enterprising difference\nPatients who underwent the minimal invasive surgery had four times greater likelihood of returns then uh when they had the surgery through the open approach\nThey were also more likely to die in the next four years Ramirez says surgeons at NBA Anderson immediately changed their treatment for early cervical cancer\nWe decided to stop offering them minimally invasive radical hysterectomy and are completely convert to the open approach\nWhat's causing this is a bit of a mystery Ramirez says similar studies show that minimally invasive surgery is just as good as open surgery if a uterus is removed as a result of uterine cancer for uterine cancer minimally invasive surgery is safe\nA second study which analyze national data from the same added risk of minimally invasive surgery to treat early stage cervical cancer coauthor Emma Barbara physician at Northwestern university says already national guidelines are being change directing doctors to
