synagogue and historic square oak hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh today the city and indeed the country and many around the world are in mourning and trying to make sense of what happened here threw out this program we will be sharing what we know about the attack\nAnd we will be hearing from members of the community who were directly affected by the tragedy and we'll hear from people who were far away but still felt the need to respond but we're going to start the program with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill but you know Mr Mann thank you so much for talking with us\nIt's my pleasure and of course I Want to offer my deepest condolences to you and to members of the city and the community and you've just last eleven people and how are you holding up and how is the city holding up\nUm it's difficult uh our hearts are broken collectively in Pittsburgh is a community is small a Pittsburgh is a small city and what happens to one part of it affects all of us\nWe'd ask the number of people to describe this community to us and I'd like you to describe it to us what is what a squirrel hill all about\nWell it's um I live five blocks from where are the event took place um it's\nThe most diverse neighborhood and all of western Pennsylvania and it's I'm a very tight knit community that is the historic a base of Pittsburgh Jewish community for over one hundred years\nUnfortunately um events like this\nAre no longer rare in American Life and I wondered when you have seen other communities face something like this\nHas it been running through your mind like what would I Do in the situation I mean as you first got the call this the first calls were coming in that this was this event was taking place I find myself wondering like what were you thinking and how'd you how'd you thought to yourself what you would have to face something like that\nSo I have a um\nStrategy with my chief of staff on weekends or if he calls I I'm may not pick up on the first time but if he ever calls back two times I'll know that it is something that is a crisis it was the first time he's ever had to do that\nAnd during that period I realize that something was very very wrong\nOf within five minutes he was at my house and\nWe were on the scene I'm within five minutes of that so I'm looking at different cities of course there's always tried to learn from other cities and uh one of the examples and I\nHad the opportunity to talk to them era Walsh today was Boston in the Boston Marathon and I'm trying to realize how to get not only the strategy of police in public safety but also communications\nAnd you know obviously this is early days and you're still dealing with the immediate aftermath and there are many there are going to be some really difficult days ahead when you think

I I enjoyed it on our soldiers\nAnd I heard the Iraq into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area that's right I I talked to Lisa Fleischer Jackson enter nice\nEli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother's no longer with us but I mean I I spent a lot of time innocent guy this is where I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified with what happened and I hope that we could somebody comes to the changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but at the hack on\nOn everybody in his community and market where a strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd I said she was with her niece who's sixteen alley they both of you know just as many generations with his family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials well I went to\nAt tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and give support to the families that\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime\nWell I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and we said the the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun laws\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have done my so we definitely don't need to have you know security guards on at our schools at our temples at our church as\nThe shouldn't have to I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers are to this but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here in Reno\nWelfare you also getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much ...\nAnd ... other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell ... she'll Lugar said he that he held a special subs to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nAre intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed a lot to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my mushroom and also find our boys you know we often shoe that we offer our prayers and bunch\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we much put those prayers into action we must give them a later age and with ... with our actions we can ensure that the hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there were some people who might have been afraid to come out today goes there\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put your target on her back\nIn the open and affirming unity and that hasn't been every once in awhile version every one of those ... sexual and everyone is welcome and unknown welcome but to be shown liberated what was the tests\nUh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship but they did come and to say thank you for doing this so that makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I do have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events or because he's a police officer in white whole nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives so\nIt was very frightening pros personally um but I I Try to allow God ... the urge to give me the bull moose\nThat I Need I I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred to intimidate me ...\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendance at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship on for her yesterday's attacks on the synagogue were baby naming ceremony was being was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that and of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind because I started here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head tenants plans that I've come up for years really\nAnd is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking of how\nWe also met a father and son ... and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and Otis said his own life experiences allow him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nIn African American beer block and there were you really know how these things are yours you walk through or a certain number of people to look at your front of\nA don't want to see oh do you should be there because of your of your color\nMassey what about you I

E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleventh people who were shot to death at a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania\nFaith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium NPR's Quil Lawrence has outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh me all day Quinn welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\nSome lovely now you also spent some time in squirrel hill the neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there\nYeah and people wrote and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going through Sunday services and you could see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC\nHere's what you said\nI came today that\nWaiting patients and now says hey I think I'm going to let them read the articles and news articles that I Want to sit and talk of the class and just get it unless face a\nProcess that happened and what they thought they were really moved by family been fighting the Holocaust for weeks\nAnd people were saying that you know in a little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realize it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I Iran and to Dan Franco who's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal here's what he said\nThey were really specials we learn a known for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for a for ... wedding\n\nThe researchers you\nTalked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying if next\nI felt like people were in the ... the ... cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents for\nThe community is trying to take action they said they want to do something they say they talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence called thank you\nThank you and as you\nJust heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this\nThat are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children and how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there's an a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in the tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue you also with other places tell us about that\nYeah I actually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually and uh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so we just\nIt was very new living here for the last year to start seeing more regularly\nAcross the room Alicia Hoffman was also ensure

old friend to give us one more perspective on yesterday's shooting David ... we used to work together in Washington DC now he is executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette\nHe lives just three
