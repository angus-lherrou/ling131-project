Arabia is preparing to report the show was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened a door for Saturday to try to ... when we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight here I Am name this very strong relationship between the two countries they cooperate on things like counter terrorism and there was a U.S political element to this is well certainly Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd there's a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in

conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos ... day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\nYou know in addition to this DNA Analysis warning also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and since then yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts them on the line\n... segments with Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than ...\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts and even though we have a Native American ancestry your bedroom\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nAnd can also here at least who one of members of the intended audience that video is the president himself a lady responded to although he\nHas and no one really made it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were debate to debate her and twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said this\nI won't give you a million dollars\nFor your favorite charity for trouble if you take the test so that shows you earn it is you know [laughter]\n\n\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he pay up the million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at

the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve at that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty funny races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid\nTerm very briefly has quieted all of those of us it's phones ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered question All

to me like things are going to get to the bottom of it for as long as a flat denial\nWith me now to discuss this and the president's visit to Florida is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Mara I'm Mary Louise ... wrote killers this is quite the turn of phrase do we know the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly what\nWe're not sure about that but he certainly is offering an alternative theory of the case although he did not explain how row killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and um\nKilled somebody in there but I think you see that his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times that the king flatly denied it he firmly denied it and we've seen this pattern before when he took ... quote strong denials that Russia didn't interfere\nIn the twenty sixteen elections he even offered an alternative theory of the case back then when he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on a bed might have hacked the Democrats emails so that's his instinct to\nBasically to protect defend dictators\nSo Rome killers is maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy yes okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nWell this was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races the cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can't keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural disasters are a very positive political opportunity for incumbent governors because they have the resources and executive powers that non incumbent slack they can be a acting helping people really keeping in the spotlight\nAsk you about one of the big issues in the Florida Senate race this is the red algae bloom the spin following the state's be choose and which is tied to warmer waters that come with climate change and the warm waters which are of course also tied to the increasing intensity of hurricanes like hurricane Michael how is the president talking about that has worked Scott talking about\nThat well what's so interesting about that is the president gave an interview to sixty minutes last night in which he said he thought the climate was changing but he wouldn't say that people are human

credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states it all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men [noise] what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison walls at rates we estimated often two to three times higher\nFor what prisons classified us more fractures petty stuff you can get
