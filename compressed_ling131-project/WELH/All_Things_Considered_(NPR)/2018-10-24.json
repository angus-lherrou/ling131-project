S. dot ORG and the listeners who support this NPR station\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I Know for Chang\nAnd act of terror that is what New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is calling a suspicious package sent to CNN in New York\nStudios were evacuated this morning because of that package which was reportedly addressed a former CIA director John Brennan that CNN was not the only target authorities discovered a number of suspicious packages including when sense to Hillary Clinton\nAnd former president Morocco bomber they came on the heels of another suspicious package sent a billionaire George Soros earlier in the week\nNPR's Ryan Lucas has been following all of these developments and joins us now he Ryan or other\nOkay sell a lot of moving parts here all day where do things stand now what do we now\nAt this point in time authorities are talking about uh six suspicious packages and total a one was addressed to Clinton at her home in New York another to Obama or here in Washington DC the secret service intercepted both of those during routine screening overnight there were identified as time has\nPotential explosive devices and then this morning a third suspicious package was said CNN's office in New York City\nOne was addressed to Brennan who of course was Obama's CIA director and a CNN evacuated the building a NYPD take off the streets called in the bomb squad at the package was contained in taking away\nRight okay so those packages you described are the ones grabbing the headlines but there were more packages that we know about tell us about\nThat was well another suspicious package was sent to Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder at his law firm here in Washington the address was wrong a package bounce back to the return address which was for democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz Florida a law enforcement officials are at her office in Florida dealing with a suspicious package there\nUS Capitol police say they intercepted another package that was addressed to democratic congresswoman Maxine Waters\nAre and then remember today's packages of as you've said these if not the first time that we've seen this this week on Monday the potential explosive device was discovered at the home of George Soros who of course billionaire investor big supporter of democratic costs\nUs right so what are authorities saying about the devices in these packages\nWell a senior law enforcement official in New York described it devices pipe bombs I said that they are the device sent a Soros was nearly identical to the one Senator Clinton and Obama are we know the most at this point about the package that was sent to CNN officials say it contained a potential explosive device and\nA a suspicious white powder that hasn't been identified young law enforcement officials that I've spoken with they did not have any information about other packages containing white powder so it seems at this point in time only the one set of CNN did I'm now all of these potential explosive devices are being sent to the FBI for analysis and the Potter as as well\nSo the obvious connection between all these package is at least on the surface is that the people targeted are all high profile Democrats how what are authorities saying about that link\nIt certainly is the link on the surface that we can all look at and say yeah these are all Democrats uh as far as investigators are saying at this point in time or they don't want to talk about what the investigation looks like and what that might mean\nIt's very early they want to get all the packages into the lab take a look at them see what the similarities are um\nNew York's democratic mayor and governor however have address this issue they both called for a cooling of political rhetoric or that the tensions need to be taken down a bit um scenery ... senior Republicans in Congress did as well including Congressman Steve ... remembers the police was shot last year

region of the country that's been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of a valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to his little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hurt a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboys stereotype of self reliance that runs\nDeep you know pick up a by your bootstraps mentality Kathy\nEvil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not I mean that's not a political statement one way or another way of nuns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen\nIt wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a decision between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program and she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nBut these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to all\nAll the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend\nOur friends help them through tough times lily points up to her son the crowded wall\nSupporting and positive because I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just stuff like that what they're going to face and they don't feel like getting\nReally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength Pussy with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's what her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad to suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's cuts to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction\nRepresents a broader shift in thinking and the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream\nAnd try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people on the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is ... she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think is incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly success\nOthers in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there's so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes or husband or lily leaves dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris has the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you um well you have a super\nPowerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to creating social movement and changing social norms and changing things that need to change\nKids are catalysts to change Morris says you start there and hopefully the community will follow Kirk Siegler NPR News Grand Junction Colorado\n\nAnd tomorrow on MORNING edition we hear how the killing of Saudi journalist democracy cod

were sinking identical novel line manila envelopes each of them with the return address a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nBut those envelopes weren't all of this suspicious packages reporting today for more on this we're joined by NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas Hey Ryan either\nOkay to take me through this the FBI says there were five potential explosive devices but they're also report that more\n[noise] that's right so the FBI says that these envelopes were address to George Soros he's a billionaire big contributor\nTo democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan the package that was intended for Britain was sent to CNN's New York office right or not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however\nUh that the package that didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives\nAnother was California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nUS Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her they say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI right now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package\nOr doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late and not clear at this point but the FBI did say that statement on Wednesday that\nUh it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know that at this point\nWhat do we know about the five packages that the FBI discussed in it\nThem as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the one set the CNN or the package also is said to have contained to white powder\nNow the FBI itself says that all of the explosive devices were mailed in these identical bubble wrap envelopes the addresses on the packages were computer printed the return address on all of them was as you mentioned for Wasserman Schultz although her last name was ah was misspelled\nEach package had six U.S Postal service stamps although in the one photo of a package that was provided by the FBI doesn't appear as though they were post marked which could mean that in that case or the individual or individuals ah put stance on it but didn't have to mail it now\nThe packages addressed a former attorney general Eric Holder didn't make it to his office it was re routed the FBI says to the return a address which of course is Wasserman Schultz now she says today that she didn't send these ah she says she's deeply disturbed by these packages are disturbed that it showed up and that her name has been used and and all\nThis and they said we have a

rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide things got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash\nOf teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around our whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick shuttle by your bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not ... I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program\nWhen fellow students could be in trouble of these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and\nAlso that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the suicides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in classrooms\nWith a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nFortune ... middle school eighth grader ... in the lunchroom taping note cards to a wall\nOr all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend [noise] or how a friend who's helped them through tough times lily points up to her and the crowded wall\nSupporting and positive

wearing blue sources of strength could eat the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others she says that's\nWhat her friends did for her\nActually lost my uncle and my dad suicide so\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope and don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents\nA broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to\nTackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people on the front lines sound confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is ... she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband to suicide\nThe idea of of having um appear or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think is incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here it was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad a competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nIs most common here among older men likes tools husband or ... dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morse is the school districts news suicide prevention\nWell you have a super powerful voice\nThey have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to
