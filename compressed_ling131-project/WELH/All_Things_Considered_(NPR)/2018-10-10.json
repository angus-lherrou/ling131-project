limousine crash in New York that killed twenty people last weekend is raising questions about safety regulations little makers do not have to prove that their vehicles meet the same safety standards as other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely when we think about motor vehicles\nJason living as the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither Carson or buses\nRegular she started a gym in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill cruising find has the c._e._o. of dreading locks ... company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual ... of these modified Lindsey ... can be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars that amount is from ... from the value of some of those Lindsey\nButtons on day also says he personally would support more safety regulations\nThere should be nationwide certain type of regulations that have made sure that these vehicles are\nUp to be in shape to certain wanting\nSome stretch limos are safer than others he says companies can do whole test where a powerful machine yanks on seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something to force the impact you can speak for if if they're not properly installed a certain place underneath the vehicle and on the interior the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe for a limo and find tastes as\nSome of the public not care about safety for ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for us\nThe onus shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's it's really grossly unfair people aren't they always care about safety I just think most people that if they're in the business that their minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limit safety\nIn twenty Fifteen there was a deadly Leno crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issued a call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLiving of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to see a lack of movement out of D.C having states lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are still working out exactly what happened in New York last weekend when the two thousand one Ford stretch limousine crashed and killed twenty

stave off inflation rate on the Federal Reserve has said they will continue to raise rates gradually it suggested I Will stop raising two it's ... it's been smart rated between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there are but interest rates are fears contributed to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous in fact\nI this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable\nA and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go\nThere are some inflation concerns but they're\nRelated to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifth year low so there's concern in the markets the wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more than ... flirtation pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong ... student ... good for the stock market what happened\nWell the

gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago and of course there are these concerns about a global trade war\nAre disrupting a the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China\nSo what we saw today is this could this be the beginning Eddie Long downward trend well\nMost analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the dial down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading driven by

U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect is as us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show of you to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumble could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ... what\nMy sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person is a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talked to reporters like you were I\nI think there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime and Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so mom or who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people and the White House in the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely Jerry ... have been some honor NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there was a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe v Wade at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThat Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade that justice says what first have to take out the case that would give them the\nBut abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ... CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed and uh but very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases to move forward to sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn says in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this court\nThose efforts will now be supersized weekend says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network the states and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the mid term elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering\nNamed Raul is also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B. Anthony List the cabinet I'll Fight has also served as a reminder of the importance of elections\nThe cabin a confirmation battle kind of exemplified why we're back to the to begin with you know why we've been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer and that's because you know precisely the Senate is aware Supreme Court justices are confirmed\nWith Kavanaugh on the Supreme

his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here they can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't find new housing for them the apartment owner is giving each

friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe closed Daria hurricane we actually opened back up that Tuesday for the public after the hurricane um ...\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo what looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business I came in for a few\nDays to help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with that\nNeither business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck is coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income your employees are likely to have become displaced and you can't get 'em out so it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nSeem a famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that he had to North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disprove that production but it's too soon to tell whether it's with the economy or housing some injury becomes apparent only as time goes by Tom Gjelten NPR News Wilmington North Carolina\nBut says Rhode Island public radio it's five forty four I'm Out in this week's this I Believe New England essay Marion teacher Chris mcenroe talks about managing lives most challenging moments\nI'm Frederick Bremer host of this I Believe New England all of us need help at some point in our lives sometimes at many points in our lives on good days are wish for help is relatively trivial say asking neighbor to help us move a piece of furniture are passer by for driving directions\nAt other times or needs for eight maybe deeper and wider\nSay in the midst of an overwhelming health or parenting crisis some of us are quick to summon help when we need it with new sense of shame or embarrassment but for others of us asking for help is loaded as if it's a sign of weakness\nSometimes reticence doesn't much matter but as we hear from Chris mcenroe sometimes it does matter\nA lot\nIt's a man thing I think I Would rather be asked for help then ask I see that and the men I Know we seemed to lack the skill of asking\nDifficult circumstances that skill that we have so actively not engaged that we have left to rot on the vine from lack of use and practice that skill asking for help is available to us\nOne recent Saturday morning I received news of a friend who had died by driving into a telephone pole\nHe was one of the first people to introduce me to akita martial art I Would continue to study for the next Eighteen years\nLeft training only a few years after I began he would return to the occasional visit and I always marveled at a skill he was powerful natural and he seemed to be able to come back once a year and shown no signs of decline\nSo it may be years between get togethers I felt they knew him he was funny irreverent deeply compassionate rebellious and spoke about his family has the focus of his life of creativity in of his curiosity\nThe news of his passing was completely discordant from what I knew\nThe paper reported that he lived in a town I knew he did not live in\nI Hope that meant it with someone else\nBut the paper was correct in both the name and the place unknown to me he had moved because he had gotten divorced he had some personal issues that made him dysfunctional and its relationships he became alienated lonely and despondent\nThe consequence of not asking for help at a critical moment can be immediate and in my friend's case fatal and so I Believe knowing when and how to ask for help is a skill that should be practiced\nCan you help me can you hold that door can you give me some directions\nI'm In a conflict with someone who means a great deal to me can you give me some advice\nAnd when I don't want to ask for help because I'm too proud or too lazy\nI'm going to think of my powerful friend [noise]\nAnd

hurricane maximum one hundred and fifty five miles per hour landfall happened right around twelve thirty central time between Mexico Beach Florida and the air force base\nAll right NPR's Debbie Elliott joins us now from the Florida Panhandle in ... hey Debbie Hi there so we know conditions are still unfolding as the storm moves inland but what can you tell us about the impact of the storm so far well it it's moved past\nHere in the Florida Panhandle I'm about a hundred miles from where it came ashore but there are some serious implications 'em down along the coast where where the storm came in it picked up even more steam and intensified before it came ashore\nThe wins cause significant property damage we're getting reports of race rep top building some structures collapsing\nTrees had been blown down over a very wide area power lines are down hundreds of thousands without power right now but water is also a major major issue here Michael pushed this wall of water ashore\nThe

Florida towns is what I call them they're not the big ...\nJust so older historic homes longtime fishing communities really feeling the brunt of this\nDid you get the sense that people in this area were prepared enough where they taking this seriously enough before the storm\nHurricane Michael came up really fast and the Gulf over the weekend so there wasn't a lot of lead time yeah um evacuations were ordered for hundreds of thousands of people you know as I drove along the coast to get here you know towns like Fort Walton Beach Panama City were empty and boarded up\nBut there are always people who stay behind and sometimes people who end up staying just because they\nDon't have the resources to get out right and so after a briefing with President Trump today federal emergency management director Brock Long said that was what he was worried about the people who stayed behind\nWe are concerned that many says chose not to either one of them were prepared was rich teams to try to go in and\nSo that's what's happening next you know along the coast you know clearing roads\nOf those down trees I talked about so that emergency crews can get into the affected areas they've got shallow water rescue boats their helicopters and high water vehicles that have been staged for their response neighboring states have offered teams to help so that's where this move next right here along the coast\nSo we know hurricane Michael's landfall there on the Florida coast is not going to be the end of the story what kind of threat does this storm posed going forward now\nWill the crazy
