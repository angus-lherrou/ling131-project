Jew who has not been seen since he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey two weeks ago turkey says the Saudis killed him\nAnd here's Michelle element is traveling with the secretary of state which means she too is in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh Hi Michelle\nHi there Mary Louis so I'm going to get to the substance of these talks today in a minute but start with the objects they are tricky I mentioned friendly handshakes and smiles meanwhile the agenda is to to discuss an alleged murder murder plot by the Saudis\nYeah it was kind of striking because you know in the face of it it looks like it's very typical visit by a secretary of state going to see the king in his palace a brief stop at the foreign ministry and and a lot of time with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman is this young very powerful figure\nDirecting candid you know get below speak for quite tough but you wouldn't know it by watching these men greeting each other in front of the cameras and talking about how important this relationship is\nOr it talk about the substance what did they say to each other in these direct and candid talks\nWell they've the U.S officials have said very little about that I mean they say that Trump sent ... here to convey the message that it's really important for the Saudis to conduct a thorough transparent investigation into the disappearance of this Washington Post columnist\nUm U.S officials haven't weighed in about all of these reports\nIn the news at the Saudis are now portraying this is like an interrogation gone horribly wrong we don't know exactly how the Saudis have been spinning this with ... in private or if he believes them\nBut we do know that President Trump seems to at least according to his Twitter feed Trump says he spoke by phone to the ground Brent who is with pomp a oh at the time and he says\nThat the crown prince and this is the quote on Twitter totally denied any knowledge of what took place in the conflict\n[noise] it does seem as though Pompeo has been sent to walk this really fine line President Trump is threatened severe punishment has words to whoever's responsible for ... disappearance maybe murder but but there's also a lot more at stake here in the in the wider us Saudi relationship\nYeah and in this country Mary Louise is is really key to the Mid East strategy of the Trump Administration and there are big us arms deals\nAt stake these are U.S policy on Iran is is a vital here the sanctions are going back into force and the the us needs the Saudis\nTo keep the oil markets stable um and then on the other hand the administration is facing a lot of pressure from Congress members of Congress are outraged over this apparent murder in the consulate in Istanbul and over the Saudi conduct in the war in Yemen so I think you're totally right there the administration is trying to walk this very fine line\nA secretary Pompeo was headed next ah which means you are headed next to the capital of turkey to anchor of

Amelia Hi\nGina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we hit broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first that it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae between one and being a first generation American being a veteran and\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race\nWants to try and get under our skin wants to translate mind games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have done\nAnd it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae ... people do think that shapes your experience yeah\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I got some wonderful fellow than and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so in so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world look like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and tell you I'm [laughter]\nI I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting\nIt was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae to Q. writes in some areas vice president Pence addressed the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican\nThan it was no I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the algae beauty community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side is definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we think of all the overall national landscape for future algae beauty keep candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know but\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for re election in Missouri is trying to tap into that concern McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign ad\nI don't talk about it much but does he face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and his requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans insist they will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how\nDemocrats around the country has seized on this issue Erika Franklin Fowler directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign finance outpacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on healthcare this year\nIt's the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegardless that's how Americans feel about the financial cat there are provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action so that could have happened during the lame duck session even of Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the ability to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away at Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful rag but Democrats\nThey win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation healthcare research organization what you're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side\nOf the administration's efforts to change and then he'd say undermine the AC a\nLoo Hendricks the voter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards that single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nIt makes it easier and simpler for every body with the exception of Blue Cross Blue Shield enter the medical insurance company here\nEven if they win a sweeping midterm victories Democrats won't have the power to pass Medicare for all but they might jump start the conversation I had to the

Trump says the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened and promised a full investigation\nTrump separately has suggested rogue killers might be going\nTo understand how autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia interpret these remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with us she served at the state department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia or do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington and I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences in my relationship with Washington\nIf you take for example Philippine president ... uh who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as a drug dealers\nThere's a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was one of them are prudent in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this was happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched together or the issue simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself\nAnd when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition it deters other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green

rolls\nNPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's presence here is the sound\nHeavy steel doors rhyming shot [noise]\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women foot once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of books\nAnd picnic benches for the inmates they set out here from John ... helped us depending on what level there and that's the word and showed Tom showing us around and do what we do that and the community as when I was parked outside in our yard and I guess it's still a\nPrison the war in this the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places\nIn some ways women's prisons are specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer mess\nWith NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infractions can have big consequences when we get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children each you know younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain I have one\nThat's the word and shovel dumb in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men of other presidents were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow ... or corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform it was written for men's prison where a shirt inside out or squeeze rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nDominance putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different past the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing the rules so special about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance last [noise]\nTell me about it that was like [noise]\nOn the mental health ward Stevie Wonder is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a

was [noise] it was just meant to be punished once\nShe was sick and stayed in herself through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down up from the dining hall and put a fire pillow so I was asleep when this crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item [noise] yeah that was pretty rough that\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then ... says she lost good conduct credits those are days taking off her sentence for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a\nTo the other women I'm trying to contribute\nShame [noise] you know and it helped me with my own my own shame and I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's prisons several years ago he quit a psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in the basement sold his property victims is the panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get the prison with the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome to change and discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said is you know ordinary people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like oh they do there's one at it and Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six to not caused problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would

they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously in both\nBoth in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to ah Canada or Mexico first\nA cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel and Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive\nHow did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared in

state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations and a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where do things stand today with Christian or on the ground for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of\nGlobal engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel out to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear\nAs some of these dealings are are not transparent up but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports uh that\nCushion or a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things

circumstances than doesn't seem so so strange to do\nAnd it kills people from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen Seventy one people died from carbon monoxide poisoning after hurricane or tropical storm the most common reason for these kinds of debts is that people put the generator in their home our garage so Brickell says don't do that\nMake sure it's at least twenty feet away from your home

a Saudi journalist ... who has not been seen since he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey two weeks ago turkey says the Saudis killed him\nAnd here's Michelle ... is traveling with secretary of state which means she too is in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh Hi Michelle Hi there Mary Louise\nSo I'm going to get to the substance of these talks today in a minute but start with the optics they are tricky I mentioned friendly handshakes and smiles meanwhile the agenda is to to discuss an alleged murder murder plot by the Saudis\nYeah it was kind of striking because you know in the face of it it looks like it's very typical visit by a secretary of state going to see the king in his palace a brief stop\nAt the foreign ministry um and a lot of time with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who's this young very powerful figure here we're told that the conversations have been directed in ... you know ... speak for quite tough\nBut you wouldn't know it by watching these men greeting each other in front of the cameras and talking about how important this relationship is er at talk about the substance what did they say to each other and these direct and candid talks\nWell they've the U.S officials have said very little about that I mean they say that Trump sent Palmdale here to convey the message that it's really important for the Saudis to conduct a thorough transparent investigation into the disappearance of this Washington\nHaven't weighed in about all of these reports in the news at the Saudis are now for a train that says that like an interrogation gone horribly wrong we don't know exactly how the Saudis had been spinning this with ... in private or if he believes them\nBut we do know that President Trump seems to at least according to his Twitter feed Trump says he spoke by phone to the ground Brent who is with pomp a oh at the time and he says that the crown prince and this is the quote on Twitter totally denied any knowledge of what took place in the conflict\nI mean it does seem as though Pompeo has been sent to walk this really fine line President Trump is threatened severe punishment has words to whoever's responsible for Jamal could show juice disappearance maybe murder but but there's also a lot more at stake here in the in the wider us Saudi relationship\nYeah and in this country Mary Louise is is really key to the Mideast strategy of the Trump Administration and there are big us arms deals\nAt stake these are U.S policy on Iran is is a vital here the sanctions are going back into force and the the us needs the Saudis\nTo keep the oil markets stable um and then on the other hand the administration is facing a lot of pressure from Congress members of Congress are outraged over this apparent murder in the consulate in Istanbul and over the Saudi conduct in the war in Yemen so I think you're totally right there the administration is trying to walk this very fine line\nA secretary Pompeo was headed next ah which means you are headed next to the capital of turkey to anchor what's the agenda there well\nHe's going to be meeting with the um foreign minister there obviously turkey is also

which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae beauty woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play mind games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time\nMontanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreamy you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae to Q. people do think that shapes your experience\nThis is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell I remember that in Africa\nAnd they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to 'em [laughter]\nAnd I I mean it it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana and just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term process\nThe Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we use of all the overall national landscape for future algae tiki candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight\nThings that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having a young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and Amelia Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of you as well [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n... public radio eighty nine point three FM and support includes tea of more raw tricare\nReservation minded ... offering plant healthcare pest management and find a hand pruning to have more of a tree care AT T of moral dot com by ...
