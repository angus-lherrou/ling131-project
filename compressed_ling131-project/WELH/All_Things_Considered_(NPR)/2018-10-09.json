on just last night he was back at Florida State in Tallahassee where he went to college to talk with current students and humbled and hey there\nI'm All right how are you holding up\nDown there I guess the hurricane warnings didn't uh didn't to interrupt the proceedings down there\n\nTonight how do you get young people to come out to vote what do you say\nWell I think first of all you have to let them know that number one their vote counts um you have to let them know that they have to be concerned about\nA more than just the sport that basically\nAll athletes that you were talking to\nYou have to ... it was all athletes okay I'm a I think it's important for Applebee's to use their platform and in the right word but more so than just getting out of all I think you have to be knowledgeable about what you're voting for a lot of the times\nThe state and local elections that are sometimes even more important than your presidential elections because those are the elections that are really affect you ate today like\nWell I Hope everybody staying safe down there now you've been active across a bunch of friends those the op ed that that you co wrote over the summer along with several other pro football players or this was urging President Trump to use his clemency power to try to make a dent in the federal\nPrison population which leads me to ask a fairly basic question that would just things like getting out the right to vote or presidential pardon power has to do with football I mean why do we need to hear from from the NFL on these issues\nWell I I don't think it's so much of hearing from an affair but I Do think you'd want to hear from the players who are everyday citizens just because we're Applebee's doesn't mean that we are not affected by the laws of the land doesn't mean that our family members are affected by what's going on\nThere been a number of very high profile other athlete activists also citing social injustice but doing it in a different way from you I'm thinking is calling cap Bernanke thinking of Eric read both of whom have made a point not to join the players coalition are you in contact with them\nWere not in contact with them at this there was a point where we work on something that you worked out\nYeah I'll mention to people following along we've we've reached you on a not particularly great phone line in Florida but I think people can hear enough of what you're saying well carry on 'em with that let me ask you why why are you pursuing it sounds like similar agendas fighting for social justice but not doing it together\nWell I think you know sometimes there's different ideas of how to go about making sure but I Will say that no matter how you decide to go about it I think all of the work is that they're doing is important to work that we're doing as a coalition is important um and we're all working towards the same car\nWhat changes do you want to see inside the NFL\n[noise] what I Want if you're on ...\nAnd that was the people's hearts change towards these issues there's a lot of people who tried to deny what's really going on in our society and I think if I had outweigh everybody would be things that way I Want to see that there is a group of people in our country that's not treated fairly and\nOur heart would be for everybody to feed him for everybody to work together and come up with solutions to try to rectify that\nDo you support the rate of current players to take a knee during the anthem\nOf course if I think for me in the NFL is a peaceful protests when I'm outside of the protesters you have to go and do the work protesting during the national anthem only brings attention to the issues\nBut then after you bring attention to the issues you have to go out in an address the issues and do the work to try to rectify\nThat ankle embolden retired wide receiver and cofounder of the players coalition we reached him driving in Florida in ... and thank you know

Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct any will training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places the rules apply to all employers regardless the size\nOf this comes as news to Peter ... co owner of shells to Delhi in Brooklyn\nSix employees and says sexual harassment has never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says\nWe never really had a policy or even written down now that that's on his radar he says he'll comply with us from our bureau credit for all of it that we're not used to serve me for the worst because of course\nFrank Kenya is Rochester base human resources consultant his clients are small businesses he says even those who are aware of the new laws are scrambling\nI'm really trying to think of a part of it that they're not struggling with at this point\n... estimates over half of the state's small firms likely aren't aware they're subject to these rules to be affected and he says prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise than New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including lived trainer made available during the training session to answer those questions\nAnd then requires feedback from the employees about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York state you have an employee who comes into New York even for just one day that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is a New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment\nIt certainly has changed the landscape\nHe says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers the willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly handling workplace complaints\nAnd you don't have training that goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to cover discrimination and harassment based upon any protected category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but had been ski says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer knock during this an employee can report it this is something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about\nUnder the new laws existing employees in New York state must undergo training by October of next year ...
