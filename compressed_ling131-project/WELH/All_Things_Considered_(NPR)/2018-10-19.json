night in Montana he distilled the Republican closing argument heading into the mid term elections to this\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of cabinet all\nThe caravan law and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think well this\nNot the first time he has talked about caravans I he talked about a different caravan back in April I this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news\nHe suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nWhat they want a jar of him and there are those the caravan didn't just shops and it didn't just happen\nA lot of reserves Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to the Mexican government because they're so good hopefully before it ever [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new polls from ... that are out\nA defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans intimate terms\nUh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see\nThe uh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced uh within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters and she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nI think what this election supposed to be about the Republicans tax cut which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now yeah and immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border crossings are apparently up\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

journalist ... has been leaked by Turkish investigators and more information continues to emerge painting a fuller picture of what may have happened to him in Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nAnd yet I'm usually turkey is carrying out its probe in full cooperation with the Saudis\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more on what this sensational alleged murder means for turkey the Saudis and the U.S\nThe latest leak say Saudi vehicles were attractive they left the consulate Africa showed you entered on October second\nOne traveled to a coastal district on the sea of Marmara while another headed into a forest in the northeastern part of the city Turkish media say parts of the forests have been searched as have the consulate the consul general's residence and diplomatic vehicles citing audio and video

requested a copy of Turkey's audio evidence adding quote if it exists but Turkey's foreign minister of Joe ... says neither secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is just in turkey nor any other American official has been given any recordings he's heard through an interpreter\nWho get us as we did read the news about Trump asking for the audio recording from turkey but we didn't give any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumble prosecutors' offices\nCritics say from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in\nSaudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes arriving well ahead of the Turkish team us based turkey analyst Soner chopped I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel that Turkish president Recep Tayyip air to one needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nI think at this stage a Turkish president Erdogan can take nothing less than not just a complete apology but ah someone pretty significant and important

Simon Henderson at the Washington Institute for Near East policy says turkey can ignore that could show was engaged to a Turkish woman and that whatever happened took place in Turkey despite the

Washington the US's counted on the house is out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market\n... says that move could now becoming at an awkward moment\nNovember fool whose when sanctions on Iran or increase the game and the the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market but at the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... said something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world they became wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this war to war court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate cut showcased disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor\nAnd they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the consulate they should get access to whatever turkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly I think\nAnd we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\n[noise] I'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work 'cause she'll she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out the Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go to people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then\nWhat happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they could ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves\nBen are resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible it'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody in in the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[noise] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution\nThat was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included states like France um those are the states that I Would look to first to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expressions thanks very much thank

you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents were from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one in yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her narrow if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalized for people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and when you increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection Doug do see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nUnder that logic it Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to\n... rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to see the same way he does\nThis was going on to see how they treated us\nSo much you can get a vote of all you got to vote and they said that we were ready to go where they were\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President\nTrump [noise]\nYou're listening to all

men had pancreatic cancer\nNine ... years ago he used the word from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin now there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd ball and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher\nAnd when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks\nAnd so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to touch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me the only people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries has come up this sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and\nSettlement in western Uganda\nAt a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and ... communities together\nPeople of course take books and a little libraries but you also get to leave that might have to say that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging than ever had the next day seeing if somebody's taking it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing and being a champion for books or for reading he was being a champion for community new friendships new ideas new projects bringing to life as a result of this idea\nBack when he won it well ... thank you for talking to us thank you for having me

immigration barrier and tried to enter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to drive the migrants back\nPresident Trump has already weight and he's saying to Mexico for his efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala hide James\nLewis so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were mashed a few minutes away from the border what what's happened today\nThis group of migrants as ... to thousands we don't know exactly how many thousands of migrants so decided they were going to march ridge\nAnd just try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know if I can just try to summarize quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at this fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala that got through that sends thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from his father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nIs that right okay them up for the New Yorker but among [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here I guess it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was a it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly area [noise]\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still right here or near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back in ... I'm sitting right next to a couple of hops a from Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really the\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cut and now he's probably four years old has a has a cold\nRag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who've said suffered a lot of\nHeat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom Mexican and\nAs you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from\nMexico to let them and as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to leave their spreads we're going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLacks us and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone a show and it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going home\nIn ... seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware that a Trump does not want to let them into the country from what they say over and over again as we know that same stance but we're asking we are pleading for help because you know whatever Trump parts in front of us I mean what is back at home is worse than whatever

important\nRelationships actual relationships between us and Saudi company\nGovernmental relationships things we walked out together all across the world\nAnd particularly now as the as this administration is trying to reimpose sanctions on Iran they need the Saudis to maintain the oil markets they need the Turks to stop buying so much crude oil from Iran so there's a lot of geopolitics

term elections to this\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of job at all\nThe caravan law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high\nSo why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think well this is not the first time he has talked about caravans I he talked about a different caravan back in\nApril I this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested that rally without offering any evidence um it made a claim that at\nDemocrats were somehow behind the caravan\nBut they wanted the caravan and there are those the say the caravan didn't just happen it didn't just happen a lot of reasons that Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to thank the Mexican government because they're stopping it hopefully be bored every [noise]\nShould underscore that there's really no\nTheory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new polls from ... that are out\nA defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans intimate terms\nUh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nAh there's energy a among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters and she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nI think what this election supposed to be about the Republicans tax cut which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now an immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border crossings are apparently up\nThat I'm an ex\nThe public's radio eighty nine point three FM\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from fidelity investments taking

more more metal their keeps\nThe worst people out you know\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently does agree with parents like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world who are you ... you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you asked me\n... all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is some reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to do when the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty eight team could be the last election but Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters\n[noise] I'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera have any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics it will support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nBut it's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some of the time I was on the river on the Republican running for reelection I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do a paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nOne like no I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised which are immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize or people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and when you increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position and that physician is but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in the Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection aj Doug ... on the ballot and its Doug do seas agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters a guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry\nIt would be as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nUnder that logic if Republicans want to appeal party wide to Latino voters they will have to separate the party\nThere are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that like Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on they see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got to raise the vote and they said that we were ready to go over there and\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader
