pitching for the red Sox not the Yankees are back\n... they go okay with it yeah\nAnd they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's this historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball teams somehow they miss each other when they both and in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back historically but also it brings them two thousand Eighteen\nSo was that was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got it torn out and there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games that went back and forth changing lanes extra innings I've\nMet with the scene and spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field is different because they wouldn't got many without a I mean this is Ben they're often the leader he's at shortstop they lost Corey speaker during the season so now they have a child and then really is there a nice idea\nSo adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest and one of the best that we've seen in the national ... they

this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series and Thirty years you know the red Sox have had a positive that a lot of reason to celebrate but I mean the patriots and the red Sox but this is an argument one of the best\nRegular season we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best

months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification so\nI think one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where are these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor facilities all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made\nThe agonizing decision to leave their child and the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents who have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum or bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but well we're also seeing our people not reunited because of disorderly conduct DUIs\nAllegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about four year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center\nMore strongly with the ACLU has reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the fire we will find them one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining thanks for having me [noise]\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered\nFrom NPR News that you couldn't see this next story coming it's about psychic to take advantage of the people who believe them from member station W.

Scott Horsley hey there Scott first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico and hopes of reaching the U.S border I'm now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan he was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim\nBut he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them and\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who were apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty or for ... or from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nOr there's no evidence then of Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first lost his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear and his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n\n\nSays [noise]\nSays third on that list which was a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing

a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night already but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nWhere are you going to put it in a ... percent tax cuts for middle income families is going to be [noise]\nWhatever you might think about the merits of another

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\n... considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities she's the head of then why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in right after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to that we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast a in state houses that would have put barriers in front of it\nHarder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what\nDo these laws look like how are they justified\nPurchase has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of that is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the ... some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're seeing that those areas are having an even higher increase in the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling ms voter suppression um do the courts agree with\nSo many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest laws\nHave been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I\nI think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a an acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen it these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] you know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise] there are few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father father against sun sun against daughter well you get the idea\nAnd then there's this kitty wells relatives of Adam ... published an op ed against him saying the ...\nThis is just the latest example of politicians family feud going public Laurel white of Wisconsin Public radio reports on some others house speaker\nPaul Ryan has endorsed the Republican running to succeed him in Wisconsin's first congressional district but for some that endorsement isn't the one that's meant the most in this race it's this one\nMy name is James ...
