said she ... she said questions there that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like an autonomous on\nI had by the way he acted like in ... I think that response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position\nWhere he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right [laughter] they let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule\nOf law and not base he released based on any political or personal beliefs\nAnd he is not about to sacrifice that wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nI I think there is no question that he found the tactics of some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respect\nBecause that that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what ... said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths sorting gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged in the timing of this for a maximum that that just had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer and Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but the challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate\nI think it's a huge\nAnti says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern right here in front and players if they can't find workers that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... get implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor point three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down load people benefit are disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration Baker who's senior economy\nSi says both administrations have a case but the fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built a lot of\nThem wanted to raise interest rates and said you know I'm getting too low to have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that tastes under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they would have started to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent and they never would have allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington\n[noise]\nThis is Rhode Island public radio stories coming up

if\nIf Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of any to hell\nThe other argument\nHowever is that what especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also saw moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they

in a final vote\nTomorrow this afternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy floor speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this\n... percent send in and and they are you there on my thinking and I cannot stand and then\nThen for the next twenty minutes

Kavanaugh\nMinutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee All right we're going to bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell she is on Capitol Hill she has been tracking all of this back and forth today ... high so I Would ask and just a second a little bit more about what senator Collins said but first just the headline\nIs there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out\nWell now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they had the fifty one does that picking on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing could happen now in that it happened you know we have to keep those catty out selling but this means that\nTo stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA robot he might have had to play how to how to not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins she laid out her position and the links leave for speech is already just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speeches a kind of closing argument did was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called the gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there well she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could watch her while she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew what was coming\nTo me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault\nYeah she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault but she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through ... and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief in the presumption of innocence and she spoke about that quite a bit um and about the idea that this isn't a trial but that due process is still something she believes in\nNo I'm not getting new leader\nSunday afternoon at two on Rhode Island public radio\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people

things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise\nKelly and I'm Ari Shapiro in Chicago today a stunning verdict for the police officer who shot and killed a black teenager Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder he shot liquid McDonald sixteen times\nIt was caught on camera and sparked an uproar in Chicago it also triggered the Justice Department to conduct an investigation into the police department finding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nWhile the active as I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists it's feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described with chronic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening describes his eyes as blank um he said that the that that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder\nUm which is not something you can see looking at the ... video of this and said act\nSo the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here have been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there's another trial of laid it to the shooting\nThere are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald a preventive at night and their reports\nAnd I think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think we'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six tune made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that farewell multiple other officers on fame that night who encountered the comic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that wasn't going to a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer
