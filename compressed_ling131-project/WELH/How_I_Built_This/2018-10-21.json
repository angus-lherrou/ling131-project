mainly comeback Iran took a long hand from a small business in Boston to a publicly traded national chain and Dana how he put all of that success on the line to grow another company an Arab Brad\nStay with us and guy rise and you're listening to how I built a ... yard\n[noise] Mm\n\nThis is the public's radio I'm\nOn the media coming up at seven o'clock and it's weekend edition at eight [noise] you're listening to the public radio [noise]\nMm [noise]\nSenator Elizabeth Warren got in trouble for saying she had Native American ancestry this week she said she had taken a DNA test to prove it and got in more trouble the lesson never say anything ever say anyone ever\nA bitter cycle will completely ignore that rules as we taught the author John Grisham but not all kinds of mysteries we cannot figure out join us for the news where you from NPR today at noon on the public's radio eighty nine point three\nFM support for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering\nPersonalized wealth management advice and banking into capital markets expertise along with a legacy is putting clients financial well being first\nAnd from the department of homeland security with e verify dedicated to providing employment eligibility verification for all businesses and the employees that helps them thrive ... verified dot Gov slash go\nHey welcome back to how I built this from NPR [noise]\nSo you're going to notice about\nRon shake and the story of how he eventually build an Arab red is just how many times along the way he sees new opportunities or as to improvise and adapt again and again and again\nRon comes to a point where he has to make a big hit it and transformed his business and in Nineteen eighty five three years after\nIran acquires a small fringe bakery in Boston called a ... a business that's really struggling he manages to turn things around with his partner Lou came but it's still a small business in fact Ron himself works at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nLike doing that actually helps him figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five I Would be in a restaurant and working and I'd have a customer walk up to make it so the question I have a bad guy I said sure and they say ... ice it I'd have them the ... and they pull out effect from the local supermarket from a local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe\nShe's on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA to say wow the real thing here is that the ...\nIs not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we created the first French bakery cafe in the Copley Place mall in Boston she decided that you were going to make this a new experience a new open pen experience where people could come and\nEat lunch and buy bread\nYeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to a bakery cafe right and almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened the Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd what were you serving there we were serving sandwiches and some suits made on our Britain course on but they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on\nOn a real French baguette it would be um roasted turkey and brie cheese um and I think what Obama was providing\nAnd I don't think we have the language for back then but with the big recap I was was an altar of between down and dirty fast food yeah it's fine dining yeah and for people who were working white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings this was the\nFirst example of what we later came to cough vast casual this was going to do something that was better but in a quick service mode so so once you sort of stumbled on site the of quitting\nCafes and bakeries it was up to the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin\nA pretty rapid expansion well guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a bakery cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot [laughter] you know every major office building one of the French ... and we found we developed big competitors\n[noise] alright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is among pan acquires this a small chain of St Louis based sandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what\nSmall chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn it into a ... you\nKnow I you know I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from and I was asked by an investment bank to me several gentleman who owned a company called St Louis brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... almost as much as we did with an old bump it but doing so in suburban St Louis\nAnd it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis bread company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in the suburban marketplace while oh bump him was our urban stress\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nOr so you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing [noise]\nBut we rename than concept [noise] an air bread in all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it their bread\nBecause as we went to new markets people often thought St Louis was more associated with ... horses now than it was with breath right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight ... you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point we need you extend beyond the original Nineteen\nYeah by Nineteen Ninety eight we roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs have of self reflection and frankly I was kind of bummed I was looking\nAt an Arab read as one of four divisions in this multi divisional restaurant kind of on pan idle bumping a lump and international I had been there and I had a bump in manufacturing\nAnd I was with a friend and I said you know for every hundred people talk about having a nationally Dominic concepts\nOne ever mix to do so is so difficult but he said this one has that potential man my friends looked at me and said Ron what would you do get a narrow\nOwned Obama pen not ... I said you know I take away all the resources we had put it against an Arab becoming a nationally dominant brand\nAnd I take myself and the very best people we had and I go down there and make it happen\nYou were proposing to sell all bon pan and I was proposing to sell everything after them except for that you were saying all ... and all the human resources and myself and go down to make this happen so basically we're saying these are out of the four", "show_name": "How I Built This", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "21"}
