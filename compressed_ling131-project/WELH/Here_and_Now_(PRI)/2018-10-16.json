and the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nAmid growing concerns about Saturday involvement in the death of journalist and us resident Jamal ...\nThere are reports that Saudi Arabia is getting ready to acknowledge that showed ... died during a botched interrogation at the Saturday consulate in Istanbul, Turkey for the latest let's bring in how he does she have MSNBC anchor in economics correspondent and co host of they'll she in rural highly age are and what more do we know about this new Saturday explanation for what happened\nWell we we do it hasn't fully hasn't come out yet are there are a lot of reports that it's being crafted\nWhat's interesting about this is that it echoes something that a President Trump said yesterday morning after he'd spoken with king sol bought the father uh Mohammed bin Salman his son effectively runs Saudi Arabia\nAnd the you know yesterday the president talked about a a rogue group of people maybe having a ... a and then that's what the Saudis are floating the issue here\nBond civility in some fashion for this so that the story can move on at the moment they they're facing the threat of sanction and a lot of businesses that are very upset about this whole thing so they're trying to uh work their way out of it but no explanation officially and\nWhen you said the explanation was being crafted ... does that imply that might compare the secretary of state is helping the Saudis craft explanation for what happened well\nIt's unusual that before an explanation comes out like Mike Pompeo is there or if one could be a fly on the wall one might assume that uh my palm pay was explained to the Saudis that this is a difficult position for the United states to be in because it is such a\nA supporter of Saudi Arabia and because of the global Magnitsky Act which a number of senators have triggered a let's say that when the United states has dealings with a country that engages in human rights abuses\nThe president has to take action within a hundred and twenty days so Mike Pompeo maybe spelling out the fact that the president may not be able to skirt the so the Saudis need to do something\nSo that the next step can take place what has all this\nDone to the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia and with turkey where are the the alleged murder happened\nSo this is interesting because turkey and Saudi Arabia are not allies they are they they sort of compete for being the economic and power center of the Muslim world arguably Saudi Arabia has succeeded\nA because Saudi Arabia has such largest but Turkey's a more industrialized country it's more western facing it's a NATO member turkey as you know handed over pastor Andrew Brunson who had been jailed for some time and so it does seem that turkey in sort of throwing Saudi Arabia under the bus for this\nAlleged murder and then releasing this pastor is trying to go up a few notches in terms of its relationship with America\nA Saudi Arabia has a very very strong very long a business financial diplomatic arms and energy relationship with the United states and this is the first time in the history of those two countries are at least since Nineteen

[laughter] I have to correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nYou know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points in all caps a in regards to the\nFBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he had more of an aggression and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other network and you Instagram\nForty eight million people watched the twenty times to the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten states union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happens you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] but especially you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and call him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter]\nAnd I posted a picture of President Obama with a guy on ... and I said there's only one rocket man [laughter]\nWhat does President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in\nA coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this\nAbout it or at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post\nAmongst around no these are all a pictures that were previously made public offering the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you or do you want to do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from\n'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come um\nBecause I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic or a person to a photograph every day\nUm someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible access and I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could\nAnd and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\nUm because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn\n'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nTeaches at one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone you can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's really great photograph compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are\nAmateur photographers what is your one piece of advice that you give to people about how to take a better picture\nOh boy I'm\nOne piece of advice I\nCan I give to yeah sure [laughter]\nUm you know for uh the the lighting lighting is so important to people forget about that so if you're going to do pictures when you're traveling around the country or the world usually they're already early morning or late in the day the last two hours of flight is the best time\nFunding for

grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents are the minority students objected captain is director of the little red schoolhouse Philip first what was your thinking and trying this\nOr we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement well\nYou said that are part of this was based on you know research this wasn't an intent to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in this but um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms in it for a part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell he referred to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of that\nTo argue but why not do it in the\nWay many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like that that they could go to\nSo we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students to have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for middle school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural experience in let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects a minority students negatively it at home all the place where it's it's much ah you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student in and out of place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both of those and even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYou know this isn't unheard of in twenty eleven a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know\nBeing with but you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you're you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice miss what we've done for nearly a hundred years\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmates in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school that look what happened parents objected to have you dropped the policy or decided not to extend it what's going on\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what a what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of his students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh where you have ended this idea of grouping minorities\n[noise] um some kids remains somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so lots of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan filled thanks so much it's been a pleasure of tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography award photographer Tom sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question I Choose plus the the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I don't have to think about why I just that's how I Do like every ... it was like\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can will also have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he sang job [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer Mary ... a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nIs allowed and is definitely one of my favorite I think it's very simple so just to see the animal and the ...

past six months journalists around the world have been working to finish the investigations Daphne started\nThanks to the nonprofit forbidden stories which continues to work uh\nIn parliament called for the European Commission\nTo back an investigation into college his murder citing revelations from that forbid in stories work including that the multi government sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros was enabling those Russians to enter a European Union countries don't carry out money laundering and other crimes\nThat are actually shot is founder and executive director of forbidden stories low rent a year and other reporters picked up quite a few of the said said Daphne Caroline tackle each yeah was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were thanks to the work of a forty five reporters for the past six months we were able to\nReveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the minorities high learned and we were reading some consenting Fox about some potential links between the economy minister\nAnd some of the people who have been arrested because they were triggering devote their would need to really pushing the button pushing the button\nYeah they were using the cell phone that was connected to the bump into the calls for definitely want to get a job today or she is she has been killed at least they're suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nAnd so do you think that's investigation with a recovered that's a collaborative\nTeam we were able to meet some people who told us that they have seen they couldn't even Easter with\nThose two suspects before the murder\nAnd to the roof of the ... project was not only about to identify who might be the key does but it's up to complete the stories of death and they\nHad to complete a very critical work because her stories was about sensitive issue like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to conflict the destiny of the name of that political adoptive project\nSo again you hear the multi government she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have\nYou found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that is quite something look I I just want it back up and and talk about how this started because it's in the week compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo off this tell us tell us about\nOn investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and uh\nI used to travel a lot into 'em do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press\nBut to another think convinced me personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to start forbidden to reason this up and [noise] actually twenty fifty and when to terrorists of our ... in your man arrive\nIn the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in Paris\nAnd they into the ... and they killed the Saudi up to a newsroom were sharing the same\nFlaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day addressed to arrive to date two minutes left to the terrorists escaped the building\nAnd I into the news room and then I\nI was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just totally dead and we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so\nThis is literally changed my life because this was happening in Paris this was not happening on a conflict zone you as much in Iraq was in the middle of pirates was in my personal environment he was about ... new\nAnd we're doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... they were killed ... they were able to publish and so it was really a traumatic experience too\nI'm trying to forget some very difficult futures\nBut on that day I decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder the reporters to keep stories alive and usually when a journalist who's dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story is very relevant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep these stories alive\nHe said something so compelling they're usually when a journalist gets killed there on to something and so for you it's about figuring out what that was an as you say sending a message out to the murderers you can kill the messenger but you will kill\nThe message the story at look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter Don ... was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd a new organization sprung up it was called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work but there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work we also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper or was attacked in so many killed\nThreats were made against the Boston Globe by a California man he threatened to kill all of them do you use\nDo you just there I mean it doesn't feel as if you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um we are really facing\nA lot of threats not totally in South America not only in Mexico in Europe too in a an old continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to give the\nIf the Cuba will see that there was a group of journalists ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes then that will probably think twice the next time they would think about killing one report or\nYou were talking about the I was not project that's great and very inspiring project I Do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the press you kill the messenger you will never kill the message because we are\nHere to make sure people to get access to this very important stories so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support there a lot of children is to have been killed there are a lot of many forbidden stories beyond what that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a joyous was dining is just it's it's not just a number we're talking about he pulled them stories important information that some people want to to hide some people wanted to silence\nWell and there are other groups I met I mentioned investigative reporters and editors there's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen when a of an investigative journalist with locked up in Azerbaijan a there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization\nI think it's a ... a B. R. A. J. eyes they continue the work of another reporter so\nThis has been going on this as you say collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among many reporters\nThat brings us to the Saudi journalist who wrote for among other papers the Washington Post Jamal could show the um US and Turkish officials believe that he was murdered inside the Saudi conflict in Turkey\nHave you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what is Terry Hughes he was Jewish and he was walking on we need to to know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose lots of so that's so\nI Hope we get more information to build the disappearance of a of this um ... I Hope the\nCountry to rock and so he was a kind of voice very rare that were unique so we we we ... we need that kind of journalism and so we need to to work together to swim to look at what kind of stories he was finishing those pastures\nAnd one last night I'm Wondering he said when you came upon your colleagues largely cartoon is a satirical cartoonists and Charlie Hebdo who's been murdered or were dying\nYou said that you you said you could not get those images out of your head yes has the work that you're doing now has at ease that at all\nThat's a very good question I'm\nI'm not doing that for being able to forget those kinds of different kinds of pitchers um [noise] but it's really helpful because I think that I wanted to do some sink as a journalist and so by doing that\nI can bring on the table the life skills as investigative reporter to defend press freedom and I do think that ... can defend Judaism is that's", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Providence", "day": "16"}
