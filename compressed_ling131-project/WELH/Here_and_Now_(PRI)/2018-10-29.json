own noting it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country jak Rosen is presidents of the American Jewish Congress\nJak words fail you know we're so sorry about this route to community\nBut has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nLike first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tax not only the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was\nChoose to have been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country she changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time or the ugliness\nNot only pop to the surface does periodically\nBut it seems to grip a good number of people in America\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents and twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous year have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on the lawn Jewish cemeteries are schools the SAT on Saturday is quite a shock to the community and to America it seems to\nAnd you know we all have these are the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize ... leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe as those that that has been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that'll send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this\nThe most important political leaders of president of the as a bully pulpit as the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are met governors and mayors of you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin in\nWell actually some would say we're hearing the opposite for president have been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching right nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches a target here but let's listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSound from a documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be chilling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong time being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having a\nBig responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all work hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to watching clearly sharpen a show on TV yesterday\nHas shocked and I know NBC yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong tone has been studying you've said to myself what about ...\n... you're speaking of ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and\nTrump's Republican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against you know hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible you know he has to sue the has the biggest microphone she's going to have to\nUh you know live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nOr in the mail ... said that they will find people on both sides in Charlottesville and some guy permission half as much and\nI don't think that you you can talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think the comparison makes you know any sense to ten of us Americans\nCan't closing president as American Jewish Congress thanks so much and again since ... for the last in your

we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut secret noon is is excluded novel the friend is about suicide and tell us about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together secret newness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and finally O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from Jay and could say from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these\nNot just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden what do we know about whether dogs grieve\nWe do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and and\nIdea to taking the dog but once she has him and she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nNow I remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nSo I Am such meat yeah cats you can't say for sure that that would happen\nWell when the when the shots started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean this whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say did something happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asks where the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that\nYou know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I I kept thinking I should Google this I should go this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties and California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all wanted atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties\nThe dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who words die in their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nNot the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah and what\nAbout you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does ... this is something I definitely share with my narrative she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that and to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend yeah\nDogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat will try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it I just have to ask you it is about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who want to wrestle the story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among students spoiled at least in a draft because they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but\nWhen they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes you not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know with such a punch\nPick up the friend um and how much of this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student riders but is the suicide maybe someone you know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who are contemplating suicide\nOne of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several friends that I had well let me know that suicide was something that was on their mind so it's not like they were planning it next week or even next year but it was something that he started at started thinking about and thinking that that it eventually would happen\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't greeters of that law that

upstate New York so we wanted to make sure that you know each just\nAs their best sort of lesson plans best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for our national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the state but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health and general\n... well I'm I'm thinking that Long Island they suburban Long Island\nMay have more of an acceptance of the idea of therapy and mental health being on the table than let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out you know but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we do in response is we were able to create a resource interests who mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a\nYou know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look and see that there are lesson\nPlans out there dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou've got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people that here in our data word but an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum ... and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school especially early on in the gun in first grade second grade is just about things like feelings about sadness and happiness and\nJust general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially to very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings get fellow thing an emotional awareness so that when ... comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health\nThat they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building into progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the u._s. but less than half get treatment so this and I also funnel people to real treatment as opposed to education\nAnd that you know there's opposition there are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects with kids teachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again\nTalk about stigma talk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing gee educators families that you know this is just a normalization of a of a of a\nCondition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's Glen lemon he's the c._e._o. the nonprofit mental health association of New York state what are the groups that advocated for the new law that it's just going to affect the client all public schools to have some form of mental health education Glenn thanks so much sure I really appreciate robbing\nA profile now of an artist you may have never heard of her name is Mary course from Southern California her body of work goes back to the Nineteen sixties\nDespite a steady career she hasn't gained much recognition outside the art world there's never been a comprehensive museums survey of her work until now the beacon north of New York city and the Whitney Museum of American art in Manhattan are presenting major exhibitions of courses work\nWork that you have to see to fully see as Karen Michel reports\nThere are times when a friend is telling you about an adventure they had to constantly attended and they kind of give up saying you just had to be there and that's how it is with Mary courses because with every change of light in the room every movement made by the view or something else emerges from that deceptive apparently Manu climatic simplicity\nSome of the paintings are thirty feet long twenty feet long so it it takes time as you walk by\nSo was out of you or does that work exist\n[noise] that is a good question does the tree fall I think not [laughter] perception has a lot to do with creating reality\nCourse tries to get it back by creating large canvases filled with rectangles in lines and sheets of white that aren't immediately apparent artist an art critic Peter ... has both exhibited with and written about course he's heard lots of other artists make similar claims about the role of the viewer\nJust an old static troll you know that every work of art requires a viewer to complete the circuit probably her more than most\nCourses exhibition at the witness called Mary course a survey in light and in fact course called yourself a painter of light weights that Lincoln's does take issue\nThere's something to commercial about it it sounds like you know such a painter a light right like some really bad PR region artist was Seventy five galleries all over the world painter of light is probably more compact than painter who's cruising around with a light you know who you wouldn't want to say that\nOf course throughout our history painters have been screwing around with light as Whitney curator Kim ... points out\nActually her practice has to do with something that painters have been thinking about for centuries think back to an artist like car garage into the Italian broke period trying to figure out how do you capture the ephemeral qualities of light that surround us every day it's kind of phenomenon\nHow does that translate into paint and how does that translate onto the surface\nMary courses been wrestling with that cannot groomed since early twenties at one point she was experimenting with light as part of the work first using fluorescent lights and later the more subtle radiance are gone\nStill for older experimentation she was pretty much kept out of the big boys club of Los Angeles art in the Nineteen sixties as the consensus of the time was the painting was dead concepts we're in the men were he men and women artist were pretty much ignored\nI was younger than everybody else so I was still really a girl I was in my twenties so maybe that had something I figured that has much to\nDo with it as being a woman but I've also\nAnd they listed everyone in the show with me I was the only woman and my name was left out\nAnd it keeps happening prominent curators wouldn't even come look at her work and it wasn't like the burgeoning feminists are moving pioneers of the time had her back either\nEven though I wasn't that political it's a time I didn't want the art to be political the woman's liver should still likely because how many single artist raised to Sheldon single moms so I was working hard to live my life free\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from YouTube originals and roadside attractions presenting vibe or club starting Susan Sarandon as a mother struggling to free or captured journalists son also
