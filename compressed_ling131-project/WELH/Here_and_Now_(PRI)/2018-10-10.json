shooter where they have at least twenty victims of the shooter in an area that that was December\nSecond twenty Fifteen the terror attack would claim fourteen lives and injured twenty two including Julie pious who was shot twice after her co worker opened fire during an office Christmas Party\nSix months later we met pious at her home where she showed us some of the mental she received during her recovery including a star of hope from one of her nurses\nSee things getting into the nice people so he runs marathons Everytime anyone's medicine he saved them people cross so [noise]\nThinking graduations lady or 'cause I got an award is a day for anyway [noise] and [noise] and God Bless keep renting\nWe've been following her recovery ever since pie as recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over Julie pie as joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nThrough the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed\nA fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my ah medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and I'm just quieter call my life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign I'm On my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I'm responsible for all my medical care from here on wow and how how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay or some of my co workers who have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations with each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment and oftentimes they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the got it takes a wind data sets\nCathy my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims or will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county\nUm even for the second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing ...\n[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking the dogs and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally you had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states and so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to the law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually hurt me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned\nEach of us had such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also\nHe was our our chief of our department and he gives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nOf what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing\nAnd they were bad I recently met a a teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting and after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Dru Joyce thank him doing a great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nOne of those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot\nTwice I think they expect to see\nSomeone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations that I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke of us have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nNow I I it's so frustrating to me and it just always seems\nThat at the ease of obtaining weapons here but especially these the weapons like the A R fifteens and these\nWeapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting you shouldn't made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that there are so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon\nAnd do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done any time soon unfortunately now\nWhen we talk to you in twenty sixteen you showed us some of the things that people had given you to help you recover a star of hope at a medal give it to you after the attack by one of your nurses [noise] do you still have\nThings yes and actually I'm Dexter the nurse I presented him with the star of hope\nW.

Scott hey Jeremy\nAnd with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for K. PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate\nThis week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle\nThe vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls this Cox have a chance\nIt's tough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger or and the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate a decline to state independent\nThe GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough place California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and using indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration healthcare environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are couple areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas as early childhood\nAnd during the recession the funding for programs like infant toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those funds have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as loud as\nWell as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump to the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nAre they doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property and go what is the taxes are way way out of whack and\nSuck to move pretty soon that if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California than doing\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater or last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for us for the Republican congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races\nAnd you know there are just issues of affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings this isn't it\nThat this is a serious undertaking was serious allegations Scott ...\nAh maybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think\nKevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly a it's a it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was spending Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know I haven't seen\nBroadwell but one thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one or he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California\nAnd daily and argument there certainly resonates most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we were you bind a\nRewind back to twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California many of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race\nBut as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability for find signed\nA so we'd be watching this ahead she seems to have a pretty substantial cushion right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls\nWell that's what Republicans were hoping Jeremy they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular as you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive\nA no one's particularly happy about having to pay it it's about uh twelve cents per gallon tax but it generates five billion dollars a year for transportation roads bridges highways and so the no on sex campaigns done I think a pretty good job of saying they're trying to take away money to keep our highways in our infrastructure in good shape\n\nFunding for here

I'm Jeremy hops and I'm Peter O'Dowd is just hearing now and we are tracking hurricane Michael now a massive\nCategory ... storm that will slammed this afternoon into Florida's Gulf Coast Michael will be the strongest recorded storm ever to make landfall on the Florida Panhandle and in the historic town of saint marks the mandatory evacuation order is in effect but resident Bernard Sessions is staying\nWell when they said it was a category four on there have been in war\nBut a donor last night Herzog come in and say this category for and I said I Want to leave go ahead I'm going to die if you go now you're going to say I'm going to say\nAll right NPR's Greg Allen joins us now from Tallahassee Hi Greg Hi Peter and I know you're just back from St Mark's right there on the coast uh where we heard Bernard sessions what are conditions like they're\nWell you know when we're there is a of a hour or two ago and it was already seeing flooding uh this is before the storm had had actually you know come close to shore ah was pushing water ahead of it\nYou know nearly everyone had left town but uh as Bernard sessions said he was a there was this friend Katrina Hurley he has a shop in the garage there at the marina he's not staying there he's out of his house a little bit further out inland\nBut it's a they tried to get into a back when he wouldn't but he said eating into his shop in rain floods even in heavy rains ... expecting the worst but he's going to you know stick it out with his food supplies in his generator\nWhen you talk to him and other people in that area do you think do they get the sense really how intense the storm is going to the\nWhole I think so I mean you know people make their own judgments about this about whether they're going to evacuate or not but I don't think too many people at this point can can claim ignorance about what a category for storm means\nOr you know if you're not right at the coast that they were they really worry about here's a storm surge which has got to be nine to fourteen feet in some places and I think people who live close up to the shore that that is going to be a concern are mostly gone you know\nI think it would be a rare person that was say in that situation\nI'm at but that was going to happen you're going to see this extensive flooding in coastal areas all along the panhandle\nI'm also you've got these high winds are concentrated around the ... that's going to be like almost like a tornado coming through about a little four or five miles square region so that's\nThat's what people are worried about here if you're not in that in her eye wall area you know on that one and there's no way to know unless it comes to shore where you are so people\nThat's where people are taking a risk if they stay in an area that has a mandatory evacuation you don't know where it's really going to come ashore and how strong winds are going to be you know and and they're talking about tropical storm force winds a hundred and Seventy five miles from the center that will be a threat not just that area but for the solar we're we're likely to see you know widespread power outage and I was just going to ask you about that they're likely\nTo be a lot of power outages have those started yet\nYes we're getting reports I think it's a ... up to thirty thousand state wide a lot of them are concentrated along the path panhandle coastal area where the storm is just preparing to come ashore you know it's just just miles offshore now in the area around Mexico beach up by Panama City Florida\nAnd so that's where the power outages are are clustered now but you know that they're going to grow as a as a storm moves inland and knock down trees and power lines where will you be writing the ...\nWell we're here in Tallahassee and uh and things are right now we're getting some pretty significant got kind of a surprising is\nAs soon as Rhode Island public radio [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

C. A. actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing providers drop out of the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health care\nWhat about what we just saw with Brett Kavanaugh how do you feel about how the Senate handled his confirmation\nI thought it was hard core solitaire I didn't like it it should have all been vetted free hearing the United states the people of this country should not have been dragged into that I don't think it did anything tonight is it's created a lot of chaos and dysfunction one\nOf the things that some voters know about you here in orange county is that your husband was caught up in a pond [noise] what do you want people to know about that and and do you think that they should be judging you on that at all [noise]\nOne that's a lie there with no Ponzi scheme so I Want to set the record clear there were allegations in the litigation from two thousand nine\nThat declared everything it was simple it was never a criminal litigation that was a civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make its day and it went to a jury trial\nSo I I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently likes to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen or do you think that that's hurting you know in this race\nOh well if you can't defend yourself and does but I got the people actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it\nIt's on my website I tell the story I tell what's happened it was two thousand eight anybody involved in real estate understands the problems in two thousand they the bank folded a property ... it was it was miserable and Mr left\nBrand new brand new attorney and improve and and they get to a brand new guy kind of dirty job to do\nWhat do you think the biggest issue for voters in this district this year I think the dysfunction in DC [noise] you know the this started than teach meant hearing and all the chaos going on if they don't want politics they want to have results [noise]\nDiane Harkey Republican running for Congress here thank you so much thank you [noise]\nParties opponent is the guy she was just talking about a lawyer and first time candidate Mike Lebanon we met him at his campaign office in San Clemente and asked him why he's running\nWell for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns I've never felt compelled to run a before myself\nOr after having been very involved in a twenty sixteen election or to help Secretary Clinton\nOr in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children or if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent of people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm not running on an impeachment platform I Do want to get to the truth\nI Want to see justice and ultimately I Want to see a a a an investigation by Mr Mahler or that or is not politicized\nOr what we have seen with Devin Nunes has as chair of the house intelligence committee has the withholding\nOf relevant testimony and information in you know the other side you know they're they're making us to be ... be be some are angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches to do an arsonist couldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law\nThere cannot be one set of rules for the president added states and one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders or you know created this a Democratic Republic that we live in our constitution still matters\nYou bring up the line about the angry mob how much do you think that what just happened with Brett Kavanaugh has changed the dynamics of your race has it energized Republicans more energized Democrats more than they were before\n[noise] well I have no idea all I Know is that um you know yesterday day before we have an extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice cabinet or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will work the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been dragging her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie what do you think\nUh I think the victims ah deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple ah her husband a endpoint center of financial was found by both the uh jury as well as a a judge and then an appellate court to be a Ponzi scheme to be financial fraud\nAnd dozens of seniors were defrauded out of millions and millions of dollars and her husband her ex husband or they have not paid nearly enough to those victims\nIt's hard to our question about that tried to connect you to country wide I which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working for bank of America which you own country wide and I'd have to to do with that\nNot at all she's tried to create false equivalence between uh you know the serious misconduct of her husband were talking about major financial fraud\nOr in my work I as an attorney I'm proud of my work as an attorney I've tried to do the right thing I tried to stand up for people in the record is on my side in my case uh there was a very unscrupulous attorney a guy named Mitchel Roth\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

growing ethnic group in this state they now make up more than fourteen percent of the population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county where there are four congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive it's that eight hundred thousand\nSenator county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance since the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI see it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community and foreign born ... according to the sense that she's seen more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim his principal and CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Honda former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican\nAnd my second generation friends are more on the Democratic side why is that maybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why be what Republicans\nBecause they see the the corruption the government the distrust of government and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nA lot of this Korean Americans that grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process in urban areas tend to focus more progressive thinking than more the conservative the suburban ideal ...\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nAnd the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so\nAnd the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration system\nSo it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally a of a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country\nWill definitely be the my friends I mean more democratic or liberal Republicans progressive Republicans are self have have definitely some qualms about that ...\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new when we met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called the Saigon sunny told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I I think you know you look at generation one which is our parents um salmon I mean we're all one point fights and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it starts to finish what do you mean by that [noise]\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business\nIt's always said hey you know what they came from a a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from it so we came over here you see a lot of a visit to families cash only pay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategies that we don't want to\nShare best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why first generations they're known\nTo be a very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate but we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there is there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew and\nAnd being an American or\nYou know and having to city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown because we do collaborate and we're showing 'em or first Gen our parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing a best practice we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur Z\nAnd they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences from generation one and two\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to this country we came legally and not because we wanted handouts that because we wanted the opportunity America provided to succeed on our own\nYoung to them praised by the sea register for her consistent record opposing tax increases in fighting for fiscal responsibility young Kim for Congress\nThere hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex can\nWe have young Kim of course locally here with Pearl Kim and also I'm Andrew Kim and I'm not related not related that all you know Kim is a very popular name a Korean Americans and a quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nHow much Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this\nConnection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American in throwing us right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat or Republican I Would like to see a Korean American other to represent me\nWe've heard something similar from Vietnamese American can do it\nYou know I see myself especially as a business owner the community as a Vietnamese American first before\nBeing part of the party as a Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment says Mary and food is in part a reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education and housing\nAsian American no matter how long they've been here they get the question of you know where you really from our where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get it or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what language is speaking I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish and and and you know my family's been here for so long that\nIt it's those types of questions we only get it and so\nIt makes people feel that\nThey're not really accepted or they're not really an American [noise] so what do you think that means for the upcoming election I think it's really important to show as Asian Americans how crucial we are to civic engagement and\nBut also how important it is to educate the general public about the issues that we find are\nOf concern that we feel are important themselves to really talk about our values [noise]\nAll of that is to say that politicians from both parties have a lot to gain from these Asian American communities in orange county or politicians paying attention to Asian American voters do you think [noise]\nI think they have to and so I think those who haven't in the past are now and I think many of the ones who are more savvy I had known how important the Asian American vote is and how and why we\nWe tend to vote as a block and so I think they see the impact that can be made by really learning about the issues have concern\nNow in the news generally there have been a number of Asian countries that have been right at the center of what's going on and you've got the situation North Korea you've got the trade war now with China how does that play", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "10"}
