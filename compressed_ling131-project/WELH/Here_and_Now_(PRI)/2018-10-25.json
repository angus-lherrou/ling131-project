business in its path\nI haven't been able to get out on the water to save anything less than even been able to get to your house which is Thirteen miles from up watch along the coast to see that even exist because it sticks out like a sore thumb\nSo this week we drove down to Appalachia cola a charming town of a little over two thousand a mix of fishermen and cafes and art galleries and it got [noise]\nWater street generators harm outside TJ block long family business buddy ward and son seafood which looks like it to build its guts out on the street muddy equipment fishing gear piles\n[noise]\nInside you sound TJ sad\nFourth generation Morse Tommy\nI'm good how are you the same time you are\nHere that must be my son Robin how you doing oh well we got a lot of work the plants Robin leitch and\nYou know you want to be right food you know where you're at war for\nAbout ... we got writers and everything and redo everything is very up and what was the worst problem when you say clean is it because all the water came up in\nAnd contamination won't clean there's just gotta be fresh was really I mean just a lot of work [noise]\nThat work includes moving heavy industrial palate and constantly spraying the mudslinging summoned for this processing plant opens out onto the day we can see buckle broken dogs and idle or Easter both hurricane Michael landed a punch year\nBut this was an industry already on its knees there's the fears water wars freshwater from the Appalachian coal river flows from Georgia to Florida\nAnd the Supreme Court recently agreed with Florida Georgia takes too much leading less of the freshwater to lower the salt level in the bay and keep that day the salt loving creatures that prey on oysters then there are oil spills over harvesting climate change which brings severe droughts\nThere will once hundreds of boats pulling in thousands of pounds of oysters outside this processing plant and because of the salt balance they were considered the best tasting in the world according to the New York times\nNow there are hardly any native wasters and Tommy son TJ has turned\nBut the words were also leading the fight to seed oyster shells with Davey oysters and place them out of the bay to try to bring the native oyster reefs back and now Michael\n[noise] outside the plant and exhausted Tommy Ward holds his stomach doesn't feel sort of\nA lot to do you know\nThis nerves you know just\nToo much of the good stuff\nCounty or why are we going to come back bigger and better and stronger and we're going to be a\nAbout

Melanie yet the family's Thirteen miles seafood Mart which lost about a half a million dollars because this\nIs brutal [laughter] you know oh yeah yeah we were before we went through so many times I've been here for two three years and um\nBut the hurricane damage is one thing but it's like a body blow on top of the punches you've already been getting because of the changing river and we've gone through all the problems the where the water that isn't coming down from Georgia and it's being battled over\nLegally pretty much a\n... what we had what we have here is big industry and go but\nNot really taking care of us down there\nAnd you know kind of like I got a buddy who lives in Georgia that says you know the rain that falls in Georgia's Jody water but then when they get too much trying to send it to ...\nAnd I know that they were going to have water\nTo drink and very rare but\nAh they should have thought about this for two years ago before I let them get as big as they are you know\nHow many no men comedy owns a\nFor about four hundred acres of ... and we spent tons of money about six years ago to you know when our releases but with the water we got coming down\nTo just just it didn't work out [noise]\nAnd I I Would have never so when I was a kid that I was going to eighty nine dollars for a ... they did not at all if he's in you\nIn the Eighteen hundreds oysters were for for people that I was told oh what a night Daytona ... you know [noise]\nThat's the mud on the street yeah well if you're working your laptop or watching everybody money coming in here teaches why do you ever think we we can't do this anymore\nSometimes I mean it crosses my mind but with TGI being out on the water when I get to go with him it makes me happy and the the the customers that have been coming here since we have a close just didn't want to volunteer to help you know makes makes me really glad that we did come and do that then I don't regret it\nFlorida this was going to be pretty much over with and the next ten years you know this is just a matter of time\nProbably said well I mean that's pretty much just matter of time\nYou and Tommy watch T.

they're getting that there's no defeat going on here\nSo funny we're walking over at least a shells as we should [noise] now\nThe grass is over there just got really healthy marsh is throughout the outlets Kobe that one of the protective factors in terms of talking about the storm that has come in\nMarshes protect from storm surge flooding so those are going to slow down wind and rain Florida oyster population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters an indicator species right it's a Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population and the scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this challenge with wasters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with their other parts of your system you're the river\nKeeper you're charged with the keeping of this river just your thoughts about the emotional importance of having a healthy river\nI Would sound very selfish if I was to say I was the only person in love with this river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special environmental ecological designations for you\nBut you can just walk around town and talk to people and ask them what the river bay mean to them and you will get\nYou will get many stories of why people love this place in our fiercely protective of it\nAnd they include scientists and researchers [noise] we've retreated to the river keepers office of votes have had to be called off because of bad weather Dr Felicia Komen director of Florida state's coast and we love\nHer colleague Dr Sondra brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all its nutrients is not coming down into the salad needed water and not coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well and talk more about that Dr ... because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish growth\nIt's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with soldiers that encourages these marine practices such an oyster drills and ground called\nThese oyster journals that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like stuck him out\nThey sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this scrape scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot you can do about it it is rather horrific\nCan check it out on YouTube [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I think some people wonder why the bail us in just shut down so that it could replenish\nStart with the day and\nA an ecosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if\nWe're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of the oil spill was at the fisherman were allowed to go out and ... all the moisture is the fear was that the spill would come in and kill the ... a couple of years later and there was no brood stock left there\nTo re populated think about the functions that moisture surface is beyond\nThe economics they clean water but they also offer rats\nThat live inside the crevices they help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that the oyster race or she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things but you have to do it in a deliberate fashion\nOne of the problems with a day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a water flow planting coach out there and if that\nPaul ... is that only ... shall what they larval oysters settle on but distributing it without a plan you might as well be casting it all ended when\nWhat would you recommend any we haven't even mentioned climate change and the droughts that has been a part of the fresh water coming in from the river drying up ... you say it has to be deliberate what does it have to be\nFair particular types of research that could be done that could\nRelatively quickly in the next couple of years make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what she made it but they want their livelihood restored\nSo there's a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest sex posing that that's probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find fishermen that fully support that full\nDr brook research and really a committed effort instead of throwing short term solutions what about in desalination plant I think there are more\nProblems and um ... you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven and nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but they always just haven't come back\nUsually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but there are also other factors in play you know the the ... they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nOf coming from or what does the topography of the bay looked like you know how much the coach sits where it is it's all these questions that will help us\nFigure out a way of making a comeback\nYou this is so interesting because after Sandy Reid did a lot of reporting on people who want it to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with ... as a barrier against that storm coming in you know pass the statue of liberty is a solution

Would I Would support something that would be for the community for the auto work horse drawn to judge their books\nSome economic mandate hits it said it'll provide some economic relief but it doesn't fix the ecology\nIs it possible we're watching apple electrical or be and what happened here the fishing industry here in this spot maybe just leave these people\nAre so tied to this Harry I fail ...

she was a in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got a C ... rental assistance and his waiting on a check\n'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed ... she can find housing but we're supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers that you've needs to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting those vouchers\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers but there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seeing sort of this is low responding there also shelter is of course yeah\nWell it will end by the way we see FEMA people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school and just when I listen to how\nWe saved and charged I mean it was just like all the windows busted out back all the trees come down and landed right beside the church those yeah I'm I have an Animal House was destroyed a brother in law this house was destroyed ... homes\nWill so first of all clarify for us because driving around this is driven home we're in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have health insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people are showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some permanent gold one that gives them as the ... we got here they don't have anything\nAnd so I've got like ... this whole out after two days he's in here without through smiling and Grayson just describe what you described it as a job that he can recover and a lot of shows you that there's more cars\nYeah when he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income\nI think that it's tough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about it Gilmore had opened his store and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process so that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for the fishermen who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nWell running water mostly back in some places\nAre still pretty spotty um it's just really ... I have to say it's just\nRemarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even hear it you know inland Tallahassee rules off high school fifty miles inland it's really a quite humbling a to F s WFSU senior news producer of Reagan McCarthy thanks so much for sharing your plane and I think you\nWill be talking about housing even though I was able to return to homes I mean it's unbelievable game will have pictures of human error dot org are having trouble here and I was ... he went to the coast and brought back to smoke [noise]\n\nMuch of the area between Mexico beach in Port saint Joe looks like a hurricane went through yesterday not two weeks ago cars in boats are turned on their sides strewn across the street from the bonds homes are split wide open there's debris everywhere but for those able to return to their homes just part of the Florida Panhandle as one big construction site [noise]\nTroy Bryant's watches as workers tear the shingles off this river there and that's\nWhat all the things I just had the new the new route but all last September\nBryant and his wife ... bought this beachfront property and moved here from Georgia earlier this year they stayed in a hotel in Mariana Florida during the storm and return two days later to find their new home intact but severely damaged\nWell when I first drove up I thought well that's a you know the garage doors were money will but I thought well that's not so bad [noise]\nOutside to the back door the garage and it opened up and then that's just what you're saying right here [noise]\nJust butter devastation [noise]\nI had a white picket fence that we had just built all around the front of the house there's part of it in the back there was part of it in the garage\nThat house right there\nUsed to be right there\nBrian says that house it's forty feet from where it used\nTo [noise]\nJanice an Alan Cronin live a few blocks from the beach they were on vacation and Tennessee when the storm hit and when they came back they found four feet of water swept through the building [noise] they also saw whole houses lifted off their foundations and swept into the streets by the storm surge and high when\nThe second law most album\nHave some sort of damage of course they\nThere's was pushed up for it got kind of total you know and there's a house in the street and you're out of your house is it was a\nCatty corner that long\nAnd so when the storm surge came up and started flooding of course and it just ... around\nAnd of course you'd say our neighbors car wound up in her mouth\nThe cronies are spending their new retirements repairing their house by hand living out of camp or in their backyard they're determined to stay but Allen Cronin says this area will never be the same\nBased on a large percentage of these homes that were owned\nBy grandma grandpa\nGrandma and grandpa nominal rebuilding them here grandma and grandpa squirrel\nSettling uh keep in mind that a third to half the houses here we're actually built you before Nineteen Seventy they were literally not built to any hurricane ... they were built for\nAnd people have lived in them for years now they're not going to live on them and more hands in five years this won't repeat the same place it was\nLifelong resident Clark's downs and his daughter Kimberly downs Norton rode out the storm and carts house\nI was confident on a category one and two but then after I realized it was gonna be a three or four it was too late ... and but luckily we survive [noise]\nToday they are helping their neighbors clear down trees from this yard clerk said Michael was a historic storm\nA history here or a ... even when I started school here in in elementary school there's a book called the great pet where the city was destroyed three pounds one so far uh watched by yellow fever and wants to buy a ...\nFor combat why they say that I just know the people you know come back at us already come into your already building well yeah I've got they come in and out to people coming to straighten some of the messages out so yeah oh yeah what do you think you really\nHave anything to change or will it ...
