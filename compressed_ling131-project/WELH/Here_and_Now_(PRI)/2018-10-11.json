I'm not again\nI'm Jeremy ... and it's here and now the devastation left by what was hurricane Michael is becoming more clear today the storm has killed at least two people a man and Florida and an eleven year old girl in Georgia and for some the danger is not over here's FEMA administrator block Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety uh and making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and a pushy through doing damage assessments to make sure that we fully understand where we need to a court date our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Hoffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nAre generally Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to South Carolina this morning and over the next few hours from the heaviest rain from this will be near the Raleigh Durham area Fayetteville Greenville North Carolina the center of that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm and likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states\nWith wins in the forty to fifty mile plow arrangements and heavy rain well it isn't\nBy Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nWell the heaviest rain from this thankfully is a a little more located further inland ended amid stated up said region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country\nBut it is moving quickly uh so Jeremy that it's going to mitigate the flood risk they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their ... a week or so ago from Florence\nHave come back down they may come back up a a bad but we're avoiding an extreme event in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes there was a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe and that risk will continue up into uh\nUh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this do should stay just offshore but I certainly of this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in ... Massachusetts in up in the main even\nA Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this was the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the lead intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore um and it's one of these circumstances Jeremy that it was still kind of in a strengthening phase as it approached land and we've had several hurricanes and the last decade that have weakened as they approached land\nA reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they didn't hold up in terms of the forecast of of where it hit and the impact that it had\nWell just like Florence the track forecast when the hurricane center was really spot on here and that is that's also a reminder that the track forecast have improved remarkably over the decades\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and Geico offering car insurance as well as

broadcasting from Southern California today as part of our election road trip it's part of the country that is on the frontlines of the debate over immigration many California cities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement\nIf if you quote unquote broke the law by coming to this country to work where there was a work of plenty that's not something that I see that a city should be looking to arrest somebody four\nOr five voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice this is really about rule of law and about to local control\nThis year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act\nIt's also known as the sanctuary law and has drawn lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alamos which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union was telling me do city manager trick Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal from our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or a sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know and I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around ... than the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by these sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on in the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran she came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum\nTo get into the United states and so you know that is the way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually I'm with my wife has an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or race us\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with low selling meet us in defined the state law\nMarches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest high he says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and so public safety issue it just ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nThan if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or that we're talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nBecause he says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people\nThe ... or ... about eighty percent\nLatino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our presidents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the stadiums here to serve them well we\nWe spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that is not about racism why um why I'm doing this [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city will go selling me to take the position that they did\nOther than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope\nAnd we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor to criminals you say what\nThat he is a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land he oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and\nBelieve that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time however if you're only\nCrime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to survive being able to provide\nI see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David balancing\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is and it's not certainly when we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um we responded behaviors respond to criminal behaviors irrespective of your status so\nWhen representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say to them\nSo federal authorities um are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law\nUh we do not and so that they dislike lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law on that and how they do that so [noise]\nUm the other pieces has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call for help if they're not calling the police who are they calling right\nSo um the ideas to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and assist the folks to call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana this is Don Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump when there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues\nAre here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place to Tehran\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody is just a small population of inmates ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we release them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first of a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that's happened\nWe know of as of since January first we've had seven hundred and Seventy two through September this year individuals' criminals in our care who ice had place to detain are on that we could not\nReturn dies they released back to the community one hundred and forty of those have already been re arrested for crimes for for attempted murder\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have WVU are Boston and your NPR station from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd staples with printers printer ink and toner cartridges for home in business and in store print shops were customized presentations booklets in manuals more at staples stores or staples dot com staples\nThis year and now California Senator Dianne Feinstein is up for re election in November and her opponent is a fellow Democrat in twenty sixteen to state changed its primary rules allowing the top two vote getters to advance to the general election regardless of party\nPoll showed that state senator Kevin daily own is a long shot to defeat Feinstein who's been in the Senate since Nineteen Ninety two we invited both Feinstein and daily on to join us Feinstein declined Kevin de Leon accepted welcome to hear now thank you very much for the petition\nSo Senator Feinstein one forty four percent of the vote in the primary versus your twelve she is well known she's well funded\nAnd the polls looked pretty good for her why do you think you can win this race\nActually the latest poll as a as a ... eleven percent there's two polls one at eight percent one at eleven percent and win that election took place on June fifth or more she secured forty four percent of the vote to my twelve percent\nThere were thirty two candidates on the ballot if you open up the ballot um it looked like the white pages through so many names um and many of the pages I was actually the last name on the ballot for the U.S Senate\nSo our goal was always to given the top two uh so we can juxtapose are accomplishments our our vision and our values for California\nSo the two latest independent polls now hold us ah eleven points at eight points are respectively so we still have a solid shot to uh have a new voice or an you change a representing California today none of the past well\nI I did notice that in one poll by writers it says and the ... Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters who approve of President Trump a so I mean do you what do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat\nLook it's a it's a bit of an attitude that's for sure and my values and my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third one\nTo come to this country to seek a better life so I'm as the author of centuries state uh for California I'm as the leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage to the heights of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and also the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo ... an agreed um my values have always been for working families in California and that's why I'm On my goal is to be a new voice for ah California's in Washington DC and\nNow it's a it's an interesting attitude that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice it's going to fight for them on issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if he becomes the senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this is a man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity to our values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Case sicker say even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nUm eyes a Democrat I'd be disappointed but I'd get over it and a couple of weeks and tried to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country a forward together um within the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that I didn't fight from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can't allow one let tall aberration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou criticize Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of\nGross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner a Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated the support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a politics I don't support the investigation of Senator Dianne Feinstein but I Would have taken a different approach to Brett Kavanaugh on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nSenator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man a known partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are as we know lifetime appointments and these are men who are most surely will and do a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights\nA voting rights yeah our environmental laws so [noise] uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked ... what can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you witness a junior centers such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a ... senators Richard Blumenthal 'em and um [noise]\nUh the senator from Minnesota uh be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously a delay tactic and\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee would have programmed with my colleagues and and it didn't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed\nHalf of the senior center from California\nSo you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five Senate or find say eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate that she cannot well\nLet me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse and who are largest economy in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the site lights and I think what California wants\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the existential threat that is before us climate change\nTo fight for immigration reform and make sure that we stopped betraying the American born children are and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's home to the largest number of immigrants in the country\nYet we don't have that leadership uh from California in Washington DC especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate so that seniority has not been working for California I think that's what they want in today's day and at an age when we have a president who occupies a White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity to our values and more importantly to our people\nTo eat I think she is fighting for California [noise]\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country um I think that comedy um and just by Parsons ship 'em which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game or in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine a workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws are I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for their values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday\nYou think the Democrats should try to impeach President Trump's if the Democrats take back the house in the world will\nI've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a in a pinch of uh the current president's um\nI have not uh been ... dissuaded or for the position of taken it is not a partisan position of chicken that are the Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ship for political purposes or this is based on a legalities\nAnd being the commander chief or the chief executive officer of the most powerful position in the world I think there's sufficient evidence uh for the members of Congress are regardless of who controls are either chamber to move forward with impeachment know obviously\nIt's clear that the Republicans don't have the courage to move forward and do the right thing but if the uh the house has taken over by Democrats or I Believe strongly that they should move forward with a impeachment\nWhich do you like better LA or San Francisco I Love them both because I used to live in San Francisco and I live in Los Angeles you represent LA I thought it would be a safe bet for you to just say LA have you done with it well I have a lot of roots are in the\n[noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from ... somewhere accelerating the pace of engineering and night and you learn more and now we're not come\nFrom NPR and W.

and it's difficult you has posed to a lot of ... you get hungry at you you get any conflicts\nWe started our interview with Michael and Elizabeth outside on the porch but had to move into the shelters office after ... started working nearby Michael said that ability to have peace and quiet is a luxury homeless people don't have\nAn eye on us or just said that you know what you can be aware of it

and what's your leather you off at the end but then if you just bend you'll run out the diagnosis London you know that look it's not a good thing to be out there because the environment is not friendly it wound up losing all friendly so what's the plan what's next for both of you\nI think I'm like I told you we are professionals west to come to that we believe that um we have a lot\nOf a loss of whether the United states from what I've seen with other low to offer on them or we need is to uh do what we need to do in some sort of gets let's get some stuff to flight ... program and this

those aims lawsuit which of course district and read a study hard because it's really hard is a different theme from what we can with one of my country to practice is absurd little difference so\nI think I'm not as a whip for what a lot of the ... full of furloughs\nSo six months from now if I was to talk to both of you what will you be doing\nA phone with I've been in a\nHospital setting off

covering homelessness for K. PCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jan and when you're listening there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but they're well dressed but they're homeless\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know a demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain\nAbout street homelessness you know they associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nWe're going to be an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county next to city hall in Santa Ana I thought you know people thought his everyday when they walked past it I Can't ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis like parks are asking for money on sidewalks\nAnd is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does he salaries can't keep up with us market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nA there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and housing for homeless people and not continue today\nAnd there's a lawsuit in orange county\nIn this case came about in orange county officials talk to clear out a very large homeless encampment I'm up to like Fifteen hundred people that had been growing for many years along a flood control channel kind of right smack in the middle of the county\nAnd advocates sued based on a federal legal precedent which says law enforcement can't take it people for sleeping outside in public places if there is no realistic alternative for them\nOr you know there's not enough shelter states basically Orange County officials ended up giving thirty day motel vouchers to about seven hundred people\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Congress in orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in this traditionally conservative county but President Trump's approval rating is ... creating an opening for\n... is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him his young Kim one of his staffers\nAnd what ended that said throughout the entire thirty nine congressional that day at a congressional staff this at the community I Know these are the people that I'm running to represent this personal to me\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American woman ever elected to Congress but Democrats Gil Cisneros a Latino and first time political candidate who bankrolled whose campaign was lottery winnings hopes to turn the district blue\nShe wants to protect I Want to protect the border that's one of the reasons I served the military was defending our nation of all we don't need to do that by building a thirty billion dollar wall is probably going to end up one has done costing fifty billion dollars\nA prominent Republican is also leaving an open seat in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County in northern San Diego county\nAfter narrowly winning his last re election Daryl I sent is leaving to join the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency he's endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\nWell I'm running for Congress ... replacement that function and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on the board of equalization and very very minority positions 'cause I'm a Republican and very very Democrats date\nHer opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike LeBron\nWhat's happening uh with uh the Republican Party and with Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all those of you know my travel throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay the rent\nIn the other two races incumbent Republicans are facing tough free elections in California's forty eighth district Dana Rohrabacher is fighting off Democrats were labeled him ... favorite congressman Roebuck or has advocated stronger ties with Moscow and wants to ... muscles were just unbelievable\nYeah my constituents want us to work with Russia where we can an American people want us to work where we got rather than this auto relented hostility and push towards you portray Russia and the United states in conflict\nHardly ... hopes to become the first Democrat ever to win the forty eight [noise] and you know what\nAre going to not flip the forty eighth district but we are going to wash across this country for all of America [noise]\nAnd in the forty fifth district Republican Mimi Walters is seeking her third term\nI think that the American public had seen what Congress has accomplished look at more people today has a money and more money in their pocket and jobs are being created a we have higher wages\nWalters opponent Democrat Katie Porter couch endorsements from progressive senators come all the Harris and Elizabeth Warren her former professor\nWe have multi national corporations in this country that before this tax bill we're paying zero and my opponent Mimi Walters voting for this tax bill which is going to fall particularly heavily on families in her own district and the forty fifth district in orange county\nOrange County went for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen the first time that a Democrat won the county since FDR but that doesn't mean it's turning blue for good Jody ... is a political science professor at fortune college in orange county\nShe thinks first of all we're still a Republican county ah we're becoming last Republican as old white guys die and as the young people are much more diverse and Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about\nKim have come around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger ah\nAnd they had that experience and an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans wanted so I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't ...\nWhat it Orange County think President Obama I'm so certainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him\nPretty uh vehemently uh\nUm [noise] you know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary so what are Republicans hoping to do in this upcoming election\nSo Republicans are hoping to hold on [noise]\nYou know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump it's turnout and its taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and and now I guess I've got to add to Kavanaugh factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats [noise] um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think the polls are really over estimating\nThe Democrats' chances of getting all for what are the Democrats need to do this don't ever\nSo Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way\nUm I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand an Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before\nNot want the Republicans have all held elected office or are holding elected office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust and right now Orange County [noise] I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from\nWhen they have this opportunity [laughter]\nDemocrats may not have a farm team but President Obama feels so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that was before the fight in Washington over the confirmation battle for now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOutside of shopping center in Huntington Beach Orange County voted Laurie he'd told us She's been trying to oust Republican members of Congress here for years way before Kevin I was in the picture\nI can about the negative opinion is that in the same my vote I vote the so already my vote prior to [noise]\nMine's may not be changed but ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out particularly\nWomen who are energized and galvanized them so I think turnout is going to be really hot because of that I don't know on the other side I don't know if Republicans who feel like the process was unfair to have an ... I don't know if there'll be galvanize to how to see not as much\nA recent poll by Berkley I. G. S. shows Orange County Democrats tied with or beating their Republican opponents sometimes by wide margins although in orange county a quarter of all voters have no party preference here's Richard master\nI'm not voting party line vote for whoever represent the people love to politicians not policy not control [noise] lower taxes we want to be earning money we were for money you want to keep our money\nThere are also people like Greg diamond who doesn't know who represents him in Congress\nOr you have to read about\nPolitical\nThe candidate snake yeah I think there's a lot of party affiliation that they're going to go on\nDo you think that part of that though is that things are pretty good in California right now and you pay more attention to who you're voting for when things are not good and then when things are fine when you're ... where you've got you got a job you you know in New York ...\nYes no I absolutely think that I think that you know part of low voter turnout is satisfaction that people are not a you know roaming the streets with pitchforks and I'm trying to get big changes\n... there is one area where many Orange County residents are not satisfied and that's on the issue of gas prices which are hovering around four dollars a gallon there's a question on the ballot next month across the state the black voters if they want to repeal the state's new gas tax and vehicle fees\nBomber says that could awake in orange county anti tax Republican voters and make the road to a house to take over more difficult for Democrats [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "11"}
