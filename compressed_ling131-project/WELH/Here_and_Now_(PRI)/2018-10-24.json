reality that problem we're following breaking news today though about suspicious packages that were addressed to former president Brock Obama former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\nThe secret service says agents intercepted the packages containing possible explosive devices early today and late yesterday the time Warner center in New York City where CNN is headquartered was evacuated this morning after police were called about another suspicious package\nFound there the network shifted its broadcast to Washington and here anchor puppy Harlow on the air after being evacuated from the time Warner center in New York\nEvery day I tell you that we are outside safely in college or outside or right now everyone has said that we can eat and they kept our feelings about it if you can't minutes ago we heard the fire alarm going off all the rancor show recording\nThe package sent to its New York headquarters was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan the White House issued a statement condemning what it called terrorizing acts a journey than for the latest as NPR's Brian Naylor Brian what more can you tell us about what the Secret Service is saying about these physicians suspicious packages\nHi Jeremy well the the Secret Service is saying basically what you reported that the they intercepted too suspicious packages won\nA late yesterday addressed a former first lady Hillary Clinton a at her a or address to her chapter called New York home um\nAnd then early this morning a second package address to former President Obama was intercepted uh here in Washington or they were identified during routine mailing a mail screening procedures the service says as potential explosive devices\nAre and we're appropriately handled is such that protect these did not receive the packages new or were they at\nRisk of receiving them in the mail for the former president a vote for President Obama former President Clinton is a\nScreened at offsite facilities uh went up in Westchester and one in a Washington Here and that's apparently a where the um devices were intercepted do we know if there were bombs in all of these packages\n[noise] yeah that's the secret service is saying that they were explosive devices are in these packages it's not clear exactly the nature of uh of the devices but there have been reports that ah they're pipe bombs\nBut we also are hearing that neither former President Obama or a Secretary Clinton were risk at any point because of the [noise]\nThat's right because they they screen the uh they screened the devices uh they they screen the mail for the the former presidents a away well away from there from their homes and so it wasn't as if they were off of found in their doorstep or or in the mailbox\nIs is there any indication that this is linked to the explosive device found yesterday or earlier this week rather at the compound of George Soros the billionaire who supports liberal causes\nEighty nine point three FAO\n\nFunding

yesterday\nThe Tampa Bay times reporting that attacks shows the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developers something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout stars of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably is most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid or which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now are the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states while we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr defense has said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nIn his Tallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime mustard is experiencing a five you're low in our crime rate it misses dissenters described community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes\nHe has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get\nThe opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work this categorization of a high law this uh you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality I Want to ask you about President Trump\nYou know in your debate with Ron dissent is you said he was this huge for the president you may know Bo's about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is with ads of leadership\nWell an absence of leadership as you as you put it ... times polling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nA I'm teaching my kids or what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes\nAround making fun of handicapped individuals referring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe it's completely inappropriate behavior\nAnd Mr ... as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of get a community\nWhere my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran just entered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how'd you didn't work or the ... some money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for missile defense if this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with a check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement tried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail\nGovernor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama's stimulus money as much as I disagree with the conduct\nAnd the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars I'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor\nMy differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott now who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to the reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against\nAs the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level to reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when\nWe get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time well\nListen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor Tallahassee democratic gubernatorial candidate here in Florida American thanks so much for speaking to us of course take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Guillaume his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the textbook Corey reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGuild says his brother had it in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it here's what he told us in our conversation tell us about the FBI investigation according to New York\nTimes ... there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days in in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to men who identified themselves as out of town developers they want to invest in property\nThey turned out to be FBI agents working undercover to investigate community redevelopment agencies possible correction you've said\nThey told you that you are not their target but before you knew they were you make too personal trips with your old friend Adam Cory went to Costa Rica there's questions about whether or not you and your wife paid your share of a home there you say you did\nThis is the public radio eighty nine point three FM funding\nFor here and now comes

exciting races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing [noise]\nHe had the Democrats\nRepublican somebody be voted\nFor your character or agree with\nYour job\nTo secure\nThat Wendy Alaska is in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel let Jake Bernstein an Alexander Trujillo healthcare President Trump can the sitting governor or the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson as luckily not to lift convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and Ricky Acevedo an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami high Enrique Hi Robyn\nI'm getting closer to you I'm In your state [laughter] and when they hear in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin from young well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean Hamilton makes it into this race and his share of a vacation that a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent and I and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text in which a ...\nDid that this developer hat to them Gillum respond awesome but he is insisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is it's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent has been some polling right\nYeah I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third\nI'm democratic and I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear this answers on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president's ... people in the administration\nFlorida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources what's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on in teaching Donald Trump\nI don't know what for but I don't think he got to be able to do anything productively how what the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race well\nI mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump saying uh\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being the same just was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results the\nRepublican primary was decided well before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWho will make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because of passing it also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that boarded kill December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those uh ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the precedent\nIt puts that the the issue of immigration front and center which it already was to be honest in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention describe and has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your term election uh we'll see that on ...\nHe was a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a caravan that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was the size\nOf group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... made got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nUh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this every day we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr from one state in two thousand sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans to many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the the Hurricane Maria over the ... that have seems a coming to Florida and that are\nUm some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor race and and and the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling uh shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nKill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise]\nThere and also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out or so after fellow live because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but who's the chair and at especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the ... year yeah I I mean\nAre you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had Nelson's lead a at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently political\nUm you know I think Rick Scott being the governor he he had the advantage invisibility and the response to hurricane Michael but Senator Bill Nelson the I think to his credit he visited emergency operations centers in Bay county here in Tallahassee\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't greeters of Matt Madden

I think that we have our political differences but we all have to be careful about our political rhetoric and I think when you identify member of the opposite party is evil or as the mob or accuse somebody of paying for terrorists to come through Mexico to the United states\nUm you know words have consequences\nAlison any any to give you an opportunity there because if you're of course referring to President Trump\nAnd I didn't they didn't know that you know let's do you think the rhetoric has been ratcheted up to you know especially to talk about the caravan\nA which is you know and very far away from the U.S border and happens quite frequently these groups of people organized by you know left leaning church is trying to help people get refugee status very few of them ever make it across the board are your thoughts on that and the language we've been hearing\nRobin we can all agree that the rhetoric began to be heightened well before the caravan and it it's it has got to stop and just started in the ... presidential campaign that the name calling and the the\nUm disparaging comments at a on both sides but but uh it has to stop and I had to say that at all I Do not clear what what is it ...\nThe ... you say both sides do you think I mean the president is is using words like mob or you know do you think there's an equivalency\n... look the there needs to be a more civil town in the way we talk people on the left are angry and frustrated and speaking out and people on the right or angry and frustrated and they are speaking out and look at the end of the day what\nEveryone needs to to take a take stock and and how we\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

business more legal zoom dot com slash now\nIt's here now in Tallahassee, Florida a state that's one of only four states that bars felons voting after that sentence as I can see it right now former felons have to wait at least five years and petition the state board to win back their rights\nBut I'm a veteran sex voters will decide whether to amend the state constitution and automatically grant the right to the to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence unless they were convicted of murder or a sex crime here now is Chris Stanley took a closer look\n[noise] it's opening day after living harvest a thrift shop and south Tallahassee for stores managed and staffed by former salads making the transition back into society [noise]\nThey'll weigh the nonprofit sound [noise] he was sentenced to fix and a half years in prison for felony DUI and it was released in the year two thousand since then he's gotten sober and started this nonprofit to help others turn their lives around the finding housing and employment\nI'm a big big person about second chances because I Know people change and I know the way I was if those people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would\nIn favor of a madman for something that as a former selling himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore his voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally return home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a part of the community couldn't happening now so I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for non violent felons to gain their rights back his administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott as approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand other crest\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past that will be conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Cain remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nI sat at a car that he ... how do they even go into building fell deprived I felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad feelings that thing that I I haven't even forgive him or suffer feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we live alone so other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody sitting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model citizens\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he says there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but giving what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided\nOn an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe Leon county sheriff Walton McNeil agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like ah you know a sexual matters who are as keeping them away from kids and way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to tape but just the fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nWith ... them from any of the crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ex felons who's right to vote was automatically restored under governor crashed were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turned to a life of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless I used\nHave ideas about who I wanted in office through next certain things but I never got to vote because I say what a kitten\n... it kinda made me feel like well who knows what we're\nSort of recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right you haven't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me it's kind of like a book of yours part of a book lists I'm not a political either and I'm not sure what level do an adjustment for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy a group of former felons is suing the state in the case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here and now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices\nTo replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends\nBut the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissent has will shape the future court a hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her island\nIn person um explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get to hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into the\nThere's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course I wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis\nPicky queens um all part of a ... a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for three decisions is the fourth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturn the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activists judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues and that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders\nAnd this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nThis is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today Ron sent is a spokesperson warned and he's the Republican or that or the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups\nJudges that you just referred to houses that factoring into that campaign\nWell it's certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raise and to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make\nA point you know you're right because we've been asking people on the street you know he's got this big decision you know you've got to speak what they did a lot of people don't know about it\nA lot of people don't know about it and it's been flying under the radar for years you know this has been a conversation at a question that has gone back really for decades um we had the first attempt to do this and twenty fourteen through a constitutional amendment that would have given the power to basically Governor Scott and that\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

I don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them\nAnd we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract is in the way over here and then these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and that's climbing\nSo at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and for many young people the college isn't the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through\nA future builders America which is a high school program transition into vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school you know they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field of making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read the average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but not to lead immigration just yet if you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and its\nSo what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are the on the job before anybody else they're working hard to stay until sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\nMy eye you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and one thing I notice in common of all of them is it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because\nTheir homes are gone their place of business might be gone the shop that he had just gone\nIt's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is what else would change this equation we see a move recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools\nWe spent many years not exposing young people to that type work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier\nGo to college go to college\nThe guys right here standing here doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement of kind of making it more enticing what how else to get their revert\nBack to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisory Rosen your you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies\nDoubled tripled that one more thing as a stigma that's what the big talk was where did it last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual you know getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hurdle you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming the and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have the legal\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe other states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City in Mexico beach the structures that survived\nWe're not that much different than what we're building right here in Tallahassee they're just good quality I'll let\nYou go back to your question no if it's global warming I'm not sure what you're referring to with our state and what do I say\nIf he is warming and and you know\nThis has been going on this weekend we went down to care about it and get to explore the shipwreck from Eighteen Ninety nine\nWere I'm reveal because of the storm\nBut for making nine honors category you know what are they didn't write him back then but the damage was very similar to this wiped out the city a care bill so do I it's just you don't\nBelieve the recent report from the government that you know we got even less time than we thought maybe ten years instead of twenty\nAbsolutely no nope I Believe it's cyclical you're a builder absolutely or twenty five years I\nI Do believe we'd do affects the environment with what we do and what we build an area full of asphalt is hotter than an hour\nAbout that [noise] um but I also believe it's cyclical more than that I think that we can make the right decisions and build the right way and build strong homes and it doesn't matter what's
