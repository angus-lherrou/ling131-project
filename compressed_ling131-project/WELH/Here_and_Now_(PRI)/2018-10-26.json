that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a lock I knew it had headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a head into French ... and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stern\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures of here and now that orbit to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of uh\nResearchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system\nAs small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um big their nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one uh that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nests there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of San still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the ... area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turned to the north to some of the other ... ah there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many\nHuh you knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane did this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured that this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century\nUm it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very a strong chance of being intercepted by a hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes to that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actual is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice island\nUh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average when speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour and um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... since last year hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that he's down to come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by the hurricane to the\nNorth and north east the trade when waves may\nWas and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on the following the level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reform in this island or don't exist\nThat ship Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nAnd other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent and the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing chowder easy executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work\nHe says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize the wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made an extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searched shifting the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies is shipped about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do nice fair comparison right um we have very high growth rates in China we are very high growth rates in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a\nLot of what we associate with growth um can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently ...\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really [laughter] half of\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it\nI think so often this conversation about climate change gets ... F ... things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet right like as opposed to like\nHow have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so it's not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money is going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nThat you can think of to sort of a tendencies one is the sort of rise of the other sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation another would be very local organizations but with a sort of very grand division or this will be groups like cooperation Jackson, Mississippi who are really trying to build a sort of eat go um\nOh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic government they are trying to and they are succeeding in some ways to build\nA sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing um but that doesn't ignore these political and economic parts of the story right that are trying to put really a democratic control as necessary medium\nThrough which this management as possible so that's a very a local a response on their national responses", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Providence", "day": "26"}
