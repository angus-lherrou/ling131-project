she joins us to hike wanna\nHire and we also have poll Cain Washington Post's congressional reporter Paul welcome to you hey that's for having me and probably to start with you because a year paper has been reporting deeply on your colleagues from al ... a columnist for the paper\nLet's listen to let the president said yesterday in the office\nSpending a hundred and ten billion dollars purchasing military equipment and other things we don't show it to them they'll say well thank you very much will buy from Russia for thank you very much will buy it from China\nThat was kind of a wince moment for some people uh you know putting business deals ahead of human rights and your paper's reporting about Trump's personal deals with the Saudis say for instance they're booking in his hotels ... your sense of how that moment went over\nA I think it went over to lead ballooned up on Capitol Hill\nThey had a bipartisan just dispute was Trump how you handled it\nUh they were only a few votes short of blocking the Saudis sales earlier this year so I think you could really have a problem up there if he continues to use this rhetoric how would that would that work how can Congress do to\n[noise] uh that they have started this uh Magnitsky Act investigation essentially in which basically it's a really broad sweeping\nLaw that allows people that could compel the state department and the administration to try and decide whether or not they did\nSort of commit this assassination and if they find that that is the case there's a lot of sweeping power that they could force a lot of sanctions on Saudi Arabia much here sorry what's your from Republican Bob Corker of Tennessee who basically accuse Saudi Arabia of murder\nThemselves\nThem thinking about this mass

as a writer and the guardian put it after reading Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep\nNot sleeping has been making me stupid or fatter unhappy airport sicker were set sex as well as more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep it matters initiative\nHe also teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the successor that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class and as well that ... is with us in Studio welcome\nThank you very much you were just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why what would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this on line costs to all the students\nWhile they were pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of the students are took the corps and students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the same meticulous and program\nWell what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some of the group study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah uh and this of course was popular courses or a computer science courts that that has actually hack of times where the students are scheduled to work all night as part of the course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean\nThe football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say they'd clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is just shut up for the students staying up all\nThe extend this to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving the light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the\nAnd that resets our circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk I'm so during evolution a we couldn't see during the nighttime\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we get our act together and being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside\nAnd when we decide to switch off so much\nWell this that we we talked about some of the health issues that arise to some rats sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes or nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and deaths well\nAny Matthew Walker he's book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ads for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia\nAnd ward off cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke not mentioned diabetes are you interested Bill Clinton sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you ...\nYour appetite I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how can they this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nWell part of the programs are we caught sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information that click on his sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team the shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more\nFailing all free throws in and one of the things that students don't realize is it is not just the amount of sleep but consistency in the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThey don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found\nThat those who have irregular schedules even if they got the same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWell so how do you change school life so that kids can see why me maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group\nThe term the Fifteen students in the summer have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example that there should be an eleven are in trouble one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity and the first\nA schedule activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working we're talking to you most specifically that students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters who took his problem which twenty four percent less likely to report an injury you have as many disability days I mean you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here now dot org\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shifts there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour or give me one detail so we did a sleep disorders screening for example\nFor ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires way identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia or other disorders and were for them to treatment turns out that one out of three men and one out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep is you can't breathe and sleep at the same time you you're not going to get the rest that you need and when we first came to present to them\nThey made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the session a are kidding everybody's they all got to have my sleep session that's on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent of their without sleep apnea because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death by four hundred and twenty percent and we've had\nAmazing feedback from people say oh my God this this change my whole life my depression was resolved I didn't stay on medications anymore my marriage I came back together it can really have a major impact\nAnd all we provide people as information and a screening\nBut what if you just you know you want to see more and you just ... you put your head down you can't\nSort of for people with chronic insomnia let's say\nOne thing that they can do and and which is quite effective is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia that can be done on line one program is called sleepy oh another is called shut eye these are interactive programs again that help identify sleep Steelers and the environment that and that's part of our education program to you know I Love dogs for example\nBrown physicians

ago we reported that the Syrian Army backed by Russian and Iranian allies\nWas poised to mount an offensive to take a blood back which is expected to be a bloodbath\nBut Russia and turkey struck a fragile deal to wait to establish a demilitarized zone around it live and give rebel and radical groups deadlines to leave so what happened BBC Middle East editor Jeremy ... is in London but just back from a reporting trip and it live on the regime side front line soldiers and Fox holes pretty remarkable\nJeremy uh some of those deadlines for leaving are right about now so what did you see are the rebels militants leading\nWell so far they seem to be respecting the whole thing um it's the twelfth now and the final deadline is on the fifteenth submit a couple of days by the fifteenth\nThey're meant to move both men and the heavy weapons out of the this new DMZ that have\nBeen put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it's up to now according to the ... of course have a stake in things going well a ... up to now they appear to be moving and\nHappens then if it if let's say it's a a Syrian group that rose up you know against the Assad regime during the Arab Spring before radical groups came in from elsewhere and you know kind of fill the vacuum there if it's the Syrians what happens when they start leading that area aren't they going to be targeted\nThe estimate is being used by the un is a Ninety thousand men who carry guns are into an all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a boy you Michael die Haji hobbies I think that this ... this DMZ does it basically postpones dealing with the issue\nWell meantime here you are in the front lines where did you see there including a troops that apparently didn't want to be seen\nOr with the troops who didn't want to be seeing were Russians somewhere okay we're talking but\nWell recorded in any way um the Russians very noticeable around the terms of the physical state of the area you drive along and there is one wrecked religious after another wrecked religion mostly those places a ghost towns now\nLet's listen to little sound that you got to do because in these destroyed towns around the region a you found Abu Mohammed who'd been able to reopen his barbershop astonishingly\nAssociated with me\nAs soon as we always hope for peace you watch them the structure of the whole region the fees or pause for leaves a lot of them that\nSay you stumbled across him but from your reporting it seemed like you wander around wondering where did these people go they'd either become refugees and these and mostly empty towns or had been killed\nWhile I Wonder that retail muscle yet another and to tell us what what was happening to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it liberal and I think some will be dead and others will be inside the city itself\nAbuse or ... you know the way it was used by the regime and the last couple of years is that as they did a\nShoulder to deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up they offered them a way out where they would be passed up to add lip\nAnd that's where they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive Ron ... areas we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThe war's tool in the house out of the country it is done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if you're in the central Damascus it looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus you go to places like the area rounded lipped than\nYou can really see walked the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nSo much think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamic militias along with them that have you know taking advantage of the situation there you have the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand his country's military efforts in parts of northern Syria\nTo take on these us that Kurdish fighters look people anticipate that the Syrian forces backed by Russia and Iran will take back it lived there will be the end of this sort of the civil war\nBut you've got a you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interests at Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nA century the dangers of all of that or is that some of these guys can stop bumping into each other in a bad way sort recently when the Israelis are shut down a Russian plane so Syria is not guaranteed peace once if you like the civil war part of the war and he'd\nBe the middle east editor Jeremy going from

inspection of California's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new suits made of\nInspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for their immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story Palermo welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is made of bed sheets in Fifteen\nCells how is that possible uh well that's a good\nQuestion you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of or issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from events in so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nThe should we imply then that that many people inside the facility worst suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those yeah I I don't\nThink so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would on for all the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed them off and then call them suicide say there is when a\nWhen the attempt weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside that building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\nYou know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a ... questions of untimely and inadequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about an immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they called civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be unity of nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to\nUh happened and so when you're using disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned but doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to flush their teeth I'm like what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\nImmigration detention is governed by ah what are called his performance based national detention standards and that governs everything about medical care that detainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be timely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who\nAre have no choice but to rely on the care that they're given inside these facilities and in Adelanto in several a government inspection reports over the years again since it opened in two thousand eleven the facility has failed to meet these standards of this is ...\nAdelanto is owned by a private company the GEO Group and it's it's very very common for the federal government to contract these detention centers out to private companies you mentioned they have a history of problems\nUm what is the companies saying I I mean is anybody being held to account for what the inspector general found [noise] um\nThe company uh initially did not respond when we did our our story about the office inspector general's report but after that they did I send me a statement saying that they took the a report very seriously\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Washington Post is reporting that turkey has audio and video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nShrugs you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the constantly more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relations\nJoining us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nYeah either it's a source close to touch investigation said turkey has got documents that evidence to support the claim of state sponsored murder of ... when he entered the Saudi consulates in Istanbul ten days ago\nUm the socialist that tells us that I'm On course official position is still that I'm ... is missing about that a tax intelligence knows for sure that he was mud I'm not a backstop the American news reports and all that audio and have a ... a video evidence\nThe recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that um they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten\nI'm On some reports that his body was just men but I'm the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still slightly to knowing all the allegations how reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence\nUm I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media um there's just not strange communication strategy with this government here in techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they don't actually have a ... communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moment teachers that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach except for example turkey has welcomed in Saudi officials here to be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation uh that the Saudis have proposed\nThat is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to do a lot different method relationship at this stage but they all lead King I'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that type thing the screws on the Saudis and trying to get the ... western backing for the ... position the question about that joint committee the Saudi\nTurkish investigation has to be how credible it can be if it includes the Saudi Government\nYeah and and I think it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint signed the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of um a a diplomatic nice city on the process of attacks entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have called the evidence to back up their expects it out of the nation\nAnd there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or are people noting that at all the biggest\nJailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by tequila ... such as a spot and\nI said at techies not treating journalists in the same way as they ... a journalist is alleged to be treated like that it's not even know murdering hey we're talking about uh\nHow ... locked up journalists which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on liberal values but but uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think here\nIn our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble\nHow much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the racial Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage\nBought a I think that you know clearly turkey is not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its\nSovereignty it it won't support from the U.S and from other western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story I Want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson\nHeld in Turkey in prison in Turkey for too\nUh what are we learning about that\n[noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news than it can can see him ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in a massive punch off the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not to interfere with the independence of protects traditionally which is seen is laughable bike by critics of tacky and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which basically corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was the source of must've friction between the U.S in an antitrust governments\nAt sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack US Currency ah that is not expected to east to some extent\nAnd it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's mark low in Istanbul thank you so much pressure\nNot back to the U. S. where a candidate in Georgia's hotly contested governor's race has been hit with a federal lawsuit Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running for governor and he was sued yesterday by groups that say his office is jeopardizing the votes of some minority residents ... campaign denies that it did anything wrong\nBut his opponent Democrat Stacey Abrams is calling on him to resign as secretary of state\nJonathan breeder is counsel with the Brennan Center for justice is Democracy Program at the nonpartisan group that advocates for voting rights Jonathan thanks for joining us\nThanks for having the reporting is that camps office stole the registrations for fifty three thousand mostly black and Hispanic voters based on a law known as exact match what can you tell us about that\nExact matches the policy by which if all the information on the voter registration form down to the digital heights and doesn't match perfectly with existing data and driver's license for Social Security information the voter registration form is put on hold and in some cases rejected entirely\nDo most people on that list no that they've been excluded\nThey're supposed to get a notice in the mail but oftentimes people don't receive those are understanding what they need and sell the burden is and placed on the voter to fix this problem which in other states without affect our eligibility or voting at all\nOkay so in total comes off as a secretary of state has canceled nearly a million and a half voter registration since two thousand and twelve\nHis campaign is saying that he's making sure that only legal citizens cast a ballot and that it has never been easier to vote in Georgia um what what do you make of that are you aware of any voter fraud problem in Georgia on a significant level\nThere's no significant evidence of voter fraud and Georgia and although voter lists maintenance is important there's no connection between aggressively purging their voter rolls the way Georgia has and making elections Moore's character\nKemp is also a putting a fair amount of the blame here on Stacey Abrams his Democratic opponent\nOr she started a voter registration group in two thousand and Thirteen called the New Georgia project in camp is making the point that in the process of signing\nThousands of people up through that project they did a sloppy job and that he was just pulling out those improper registrations I mean it does Stacey Abrams in her group deserve any blame for maybe doing this in in a poor fashion\nVoter registration drives our a vital lifeline to get certain communities who don't have as much access to government offices registered to vote if there is information missing or sometimes happened\nThose discrepancies with Georgia is doing is making it the voters burden to resolve that problem instead of trying to fix that themselves\n[noise] do you think a candidate who's running for governor can independently also be the secretary of state\nWhile it's happened before in other states I don't think this is a unique situation I think that one of the concerns is that as secretary of state on Mr camp has made\nSome controversial statements there was a statement he made several years ago expressing dismay about some voter registration drives and he's been accused of politically motivated investigation so that's certainly a concern in Georgia specifically\nAnd just to be fair I Want to add something else that campus said he says the Georgia has broken a record this year for voter registrations with nearly seven million new voters added to the rules um I Want to also ask you to expand this beyond Georgia how common are exact mash laws around the country\nThere's a couple of states that have some version for example Florida has a version of this but they will go back and look at the voter registration form and try to resolve the difference before they put it back on the voter ... and put them the voters are at risk and and give them the responsibility to fix the problem", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "12"}
