I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to view and soft us a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for some people or if not with often taught people from the footage\nSo would you use many different techniques like links to the ... Web I Would take time for the fifth each until we noticed his ... scientists and appearing mostly because of the soup recognizes were recognized that person that got some memory than if we set up us to get enough of it if it was stopped building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person looking full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there is some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you as a detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that soup recognize unit which was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps are pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always look into the suspects ... victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help solve ... people well what kind of cases did you crack\nA really good one more of those a mouse who has a one at Scotland Yard much wanted and he was believed to be out the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... I mean I'm actually not just the suspect I'd never met them before about seeing a picture of them will\nSolve going around in the ... you give me folks details destroy swab or lost at the same and they've been stopped several times on the police officers who had recognized him being on London's most wanted but luckily ... I'm In ... when we took him back to fingerprinting it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell us how you found them\nWe did get actual often we even had one guy right from prison and I can't believe he got me for that one sided I ah like did appreciate is a very unique skill\nRob Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think that she's sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent for population very very few people have this ability\nWe found some very small deficiencies in the way that they have brains function and I think that sort of direction the ... the research may be going in future\nIs it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nThink is a different function is it's quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize those who've ... hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested they face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at pool on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seen\n... other types of objects recognizing sort of streams of numbers in words and things like that so it does seem as though it's a unique skill that these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact almost the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities\nNeeding to know a large number of faces wouldn't to being very necessary so so that's the sort of strange situation as far as the sun is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associates it with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly to in these super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis that's that's not the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces as well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said we're very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut we low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beat computers\nI think in the future well what the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions\nWhat are the limitations that people like Kenny have\nAs a human being leads to sleep unlike you to uh we get tied for the the reason that must be a limit to how many images and how many people Kenny can say I'm ... before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWell is really I think an impressive about Kenny scale is he's ability to rule out\nThe huge number of faces that he knows and they'll say ... to him because obviously when they're searching through CCTV footage for ... you know for a suspect Fritz ... most of the time they're actually looking at face these people they're not interested in vaccines ... super recognize that can do\n[noise] gosh I Know you've worked with Scotland Yard in the past uh we know they're recruiting people like\nKenny from within the forced to be tested for this skill but but what about other places do you use the super recognizer is being used in this country and the FBI for example or are you noticing this getting some traction in smaller police departments around the world\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

D. Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr ... welcome and congrats to you and your colleagues on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for MBR sin but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immunotherapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works or in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis main insight was to understand how to block of protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand that 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\nWell in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer\nSolution alone [noise] do you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer absolutely\nI I Do believe that this will lead to insides and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nWhat kind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolve including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at Indiana or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nThe Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize award really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter ... is the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer Center thank you so much and again congratulations thank you so much\nWill now to Spain and the city of punted ... population eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than hiking horns that's because much of the city is now car free no parking spaces no traffic lights and in Ninety seven percent cut in auto traffic since Nineteen Ninety nine\nFreelance journalist Stephen ... wrote about this he joined us on Skype from Barcelona welcome\nHigh and did they ban cars entirely and punted ...\nThey they ban them from the initially from the historic part of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extend that to a slightly bigger\nA area which is sort of the ... the nineteenth century part of the city so the city centers cough free and then it's it's it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also whether a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it was you know very well let's say you know like most of these things that was a lot of resistance ah people you know associate having caused with their personal liberty\nWas there and I couldn't find anyone who criticize said even though you know this is a part of Spain where it tends to rain quite a lot and it's on the Atlantic side of spying on people tend to get into their cause whenever it's raining in lots of people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulances\nWell you know all all of them can get to sit there and there are also taxes you know the rule was is quite straight to the ... said to me if he wanted to get married and they all said the bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else walks\nWhat about businesses or are they happy with this because you would think that many people would want to drive to get to a ... shop or a restaurant where they want to go\nWell that was you know that was a business where I was opposed to it exactly on that basis although in these old ... very very difficult to park so the reality is in fact businesses survive better\nThan in some small towns or where you know they still allow cause a pony because it's just simply nicer to walk around the other thing is that the the the authorities combined the policy of banning cars were those also banning\nThe building a big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which tends to destroy small businesses within the town\nSo you spoke with the mayor of punted ... what did he say about why he wanted to do this\nWell you have you know he basically said that the old city was you know effectively a dumb but it was a that people didn't like going there that it was full of abandoned cars that were a lot of drugs and he and within the first month of come into office basically they cleaned it up and buying cars\nWhich is you know clearly something you know he said he'd been you know he's been researching into those for\nSome time before he took office\nAnd I think partly because he did it swiftly was you know there was kind of a fait accompli\nWhat about the uh to admissions or what happened to pollution as a result of this\nWill pollution or according to their statistics went down within the city center by about Seventy percent or accidents went down\nA ... to ... uh to almost zero and I think in the past four or five years\nIt's been zero of either either people injured or killed so you know these are significant gains obviously you know it's also you know general game for people's health and people walk or people cycle I'm you know this is what everyone is to some extent aiming for in cities\nNow printed address a small city many people probably haven't even heard of it but there is a larger city in Spain Madrid that's actually considering doing something similar what are they thinking about in Madrid um\nMany many cities in Europe are about ... eighty thousand a hundred thousand black on ... so you know what's been done there could easily be applied in the city is a big city like Madrid obviously it's a different story I think you know what they're aiming for is to ... by ... exclude traffic\nFrom the city center I'm part of part of what was being done is also being done here in Barcelona it's simply make it less convenient to drive by creating more psychopaths by making it harder to park so eventually people sort of get the message that they might as well use public transport or get a bicycle\n\nFunding for here and now comes

I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like to go quickly\nKavanaugh's nomination is on hold until the FBI investigate allegations of sexual assault against him let's bring in Chad program who covers Congress for Fox News channel it's good to have you back thanks for having me shore so there have been questions about the scope of this investigation did the president tell us anything new about who's in control in what the terms are\nWell he indicated quote I Want to make the Senate happy and I've been told here in the past the hour hour and Fifteen minutes or so that by one senior Republican Senate stores that they think they could wrap this up could I underscore that by tomorrow\nBut they can't be viewed as rushing this remember the terms of the agreement laid out by Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona on friday was that this was supposed to take a week\nNow let me get a little bit into the weeds here and this is very important to understand a procedure\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has a right to file what's called cloture that's an effort to end debate and whenever he does that consider that to be de won confirmation vote after you run through all the Senate traps would be on about day for maybe day fine\nMitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest the question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete\nIs he interrupting disagreement with Jeff Flake Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they are OK with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine let's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with that that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun that's a problem that could be viewed as a violation of the agreement and you know just like got a lot of criticism from some conservatives over the weekend or who you know criticized him for saying that you know he was delaying all this\nThey wouldn't have a chance of getting the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh were not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years\nAnd with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia\nMaybe Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota maybe get his highest fifty three days but otherwise they're stuck at forty nine so they can't move too quickly in the Senate they have to care for\nThe president says he wants what Senate leadership wants to the question is what does Senate leadership want I mean who is on that list of people that will be interviewed by the FBI\nAnd that's the question you know what does columns want what does Murkowski one that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not exactly Swiss when they tell you that something is going to happen seven days from now or six days from now usually happens in about eight or nine maybe ten\nI'm the only thing I Do know is that once that clock starts to run ... once McConnell files cloture to end debate that will take that's a finite period about four to five days at the most\nSo we don't know and that's something that they have to have to consider and see where they are and ... did they find out any answer that raised other questions you know we're we're not privy to what they're finding out in this background is right and\nMore at Newport film dot com funding\nFor here and now comes from WVU are Boston and carbon night offering secure

could be here for some time let's hear from one of the activists that you spoke with this is a man named Roger Espanol who was shot by police in the eyes he was actually he was\nAnd you asked him what

don't get an independence choice now he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you\nWill do something well you know we should point out that their recent polls that say that people in the region are split on the issue so there are many people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those who\nDo not um how how divided Catalonia [noise]\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because you know in the in the year since we had him really pivotal moment the polls haven't changed even divided fifty fifty and I think that the the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts who look at the situation now they believe the\nWrong thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is certainly you nailed it that divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again on the streets but\nThe BBC's Gavin speaking with us from the streets of downtown Barcelona Gavin thanks so much for your time to do for your\n[noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy guns does here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy hey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those foods that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make I Know and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various foods and I'm not lying\nBut I Will tell you the truth that fried chicken it isn't solved deep fry at home is completely doable but it's involved well I Would be afraid I Would start a fire started fire but you want to hear my first step yeah I use a walk\nWalk is the ideal shape for\nHolding the oil knows flattering it's got the high side you want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a it's a mom and her because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil and you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I had my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I\nHad about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Chris go you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix\nAnd I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her it's right there I can\nOh no no it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting to tape it around three twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burnt chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk led fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken and American so I can listen to that crunch alright good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter]\nUm what I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender ISIS chicken it at some of that is sick flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I ... well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up\nAnd here's another track okay to go if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the best pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of money here and some lemon so that was so you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the ... of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken fried show ya I'd like to write the hunting isn't the hunting on Israel is out this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle and kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left of oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answered the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having\nNot greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ...\nAnd so I saw ginger little ketchup sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nFood so you fry it you call it down and they try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy and is\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate similar it down again the chili paste the ginger and I spread that on the chicken and stuffed with sesame seeds and\nI don't know what do you think it's delicious and and find a way off that well and and I remember we talked to David Chang the chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and how well his\nFried chicken back in the day so there's a lot of history dots of history and David ... did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what the big takeaway is that it's eating all over the world but I did talk to Michael ... he is the author of the ...\nHe said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co-opted time and time again and he goes on to talk about how it's southern and the soul identities come right out of this collision\nOf all the influences that make up the fried chicken that we in this country that we saw a door\n\nFunding for here and now

recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen and Steve was the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening in a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming\n... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out currently welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing their peers county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but\nI I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom we never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families\nEspecially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these family is just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath\nThem and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical\nDay like it's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nIt's you know I find my role becoming an him\nWon't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to address that they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho that got the highest number of\nHomeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska this used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause a each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the neat so what kind of help or you get it\n[noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city titles so it's very difficult to\nHave the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide 'em funding and donations\nI Believe a vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes we've even ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we send food packs home with every homeless students on Fridays so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported that it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team baffle it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you well know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students\nUm their self worth and their self value and what they believe they're capable of doing is so low that it ... them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be I'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had\nAbout doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHis ... probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy\nSo after a couple meetings with him over the next week um I had discovered they loved animals so it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian it took they took the young man under his wings and started showing the ... the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and how bond tearing clean the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have hope in a dream after high school and that's\nAll I can offer for these students is giving them the hope and the dream that they can be somebody after high school other than what they've experienced\nColleagues ... a family resource coordinated with the Bethel school district in ... county Washington ah which has been dealing with a spike in a number of homeless kids are enrolled in their schools Carly thanks for the work that you do and thanks for being with us yeah thank you for having", "year": "2018",
