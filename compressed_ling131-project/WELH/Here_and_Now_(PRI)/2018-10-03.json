Hodgkin's in Nineteen sixty four was recognized and then just start going way back to Marie Curie in Nineteen eleven and then actually her daughter ... several of two decades later so\nFor us when the American Chemical Society where we're at the ... for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science was specifically for folks from all different backgrounds and perspectives and frost recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\nPeter door how is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas Oh thank you so much for talking with us\nThank you very much Peter and I'm a I Wish everyone a great day\n[noise]\nAnd that was nice let's go to Colorado now for a story that many of us may have missed but not if you're in Durango that's because lego sculptures had been popping up around Durango for the past couple of years it's the ... bridge I'm the lego bomber from Colorado Public radio Stephanie will has this story [noise]\nThan Britain asked me to meet him outside a coffee shop on drinkers made happening\nAnd to wear newspaper hats and he could identify me I have lights and I keep an eye out for an adult now and it's sticky instead and greeted by a blonde haired eleven year old\nHe tells me he's than the lego bomber\nAnd take me on a tour of quote his art\nThis Sam leads me to do sculpture ths around the town many are surprisingly discreet you have to look up or down to see one posted outside businesses and I almost missed the Lakers and the sign for the old main post office they look like they're part of the don't work and the post office is called\nWell we put it up only a couple of days ago but\nOur tour and an old junior high school that's been converted into space for yoga and art classes there we find a bright green centipede like lego creature crawling up a wall I play along with sand but I finally called them out on his roots and remind him I've seen pictures of the actual than Britain\nWell they're taking photos of the older me\nThe older Sam who is was born in the sixties Kenny the older than today probably okay can you share girl walked right now okay [laughter]\nYounger sand disappears down stairwells an older than emerges from around the building or you know older than\n[laughter]\nHi nice to meet you [laughter]\nMy ... hard to get that young [laughter]\nAnd I learned Britain's impersonator is ... one of his assistants he has a ... but one bridge in begin bombing two years ago it was a solo endeavor\nI was just really frustrated one night on line in my bed and I'm I'm I'm not ordinarily are praying man but I Try to I gave it a try got nothing and I just felt really irritated and decided to go vandalized something\nHe happened to have hundreds of lego is lying around because he teaches lego robotics there his own business called the alpine educational ...\nStudent on a on a post trying to offend somebody and what are you know it was wildly misinterpreted as art and here I Am today\nNow many of his young lego robotic students helped him construct ... around the city including places like Starbucks side or the window at the drive through pharmacy out of ... this is Seth and they see some follow public\nRadio and I don't take an oath on a tour\nMelissa Sullivan who goes by ... is a senior pharmacy technician at Walgreen through the drive through in our constitution he tells me that she loves having the Lakers culture there\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

unsolved art heist in history listen on apple pie August\nHere and now it was a part about the laughter that got me that's what my male friends said to me he said it was when Dr Christine Blasey Ford said in your testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the last year for her to alleged attackers\nThey were having a good time she said at my expense my friend said when he heard that that was with through them that over half a century ago\nTo another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target we're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like lassie Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left\nAnd my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried if that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy Ford and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline report it is the busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled and ... heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome\nThank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from bleak prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago or say on friday our calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase called on your right what do people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to a doctor for it they're experiencing a ... we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody had a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding or they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's expected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe I Love the Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words is it about sex didn't do people do people when they come for help or when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about is the feeling of being choked of being of being and mobilized of being frozen we know that when we experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically in one of three ways\nWhen to fleet and ... the Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about as well from the survivors that we work with me usually people\nHave a flashback she's also explain to us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor ... presidency too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talked to survivors about their trauma narrative\nThey are able to define are frequently what the worst part of that experience was\nAnd so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to the response of the alleged offender\nBut we know that survivors have the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain to literally ripped presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to what that was exactly like for her but yes yes yeah\nLook the majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani a Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter revealed that she'd been raped by a music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\nYou know what's happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her let's listen to a little then\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get started on remote but where is the place I don't remember\n[noise] warm\n\nAnd fuzzy little again from the Chicago rape crisis centers\nWhat happens when you have this huge national dialogue and people are feeling states to come out and tell their stories and then suddenly there is a pivot now we're hearing the president and his son say it's a dangerous time for men who are being falsely accused\nWe're hearing from callers that they're feeling just mad but there will never be enough details to convince some people that a crime was committed they're feeling invalidated by the national conversation by the victims of the main and they know that they will not be able to recall one hundred percent of the details and this\nFact about traumatic stress reactions the way the brain and the body processes trauma is being used against survivors to invalidate their experience\nBecause of Dr Ford said and as so many others have said anybody who's had a traumatic experience of any kind of knows you're taken out of yourself you do forget some of the details I mean that's not uncommon\nAnd that's the way that the brain and body works to protect survivors and it's a part of trauma and so to expect a survivor to recall the exact details of a sexual assault\nFive months five years for Fifteen Years really lives the incredible complexity of the way that the brain operates and and honestly contributes to victim blaming and miss sneaking around sexual assault and sexual violence\nAnd we should say that Christine Blasey Ford did describe some of the things the president said that she didn't but at any rate uh others has said it's like trying to describe the nightmare so we await the FBI's investigation and the Senate decision tomorrow what ... what are you bracing for\nWe're bracing for increase calls a two hour hotline we're bracing for increased costs for counseling we're bracing for our current clients experiencing triggers and I think survivor is find themselves and you know in this incredibly powerful moment caught between\nPressure to come forward and a feeling that their experience will be invalidated I think this is an incredibly critical moment for our country for our government for survivors of sexual violence across the country", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "03"}
