care\nYou know we're going to scan the political rise in the next few minutes that we're going to start checking on the race for governor in the state of Alaska it was a three way race until October nineteenth just weeks before election day governor their locker and independent said this at the Alaska federation of me\nBack if today I Am suspending like have had [noise]\nFor the re election as governor\nAnd the time I maintain it became clear we cannot win a three way race\nWill walk them through his support behind the Democratic candidate former U.S Senator Mark Begich who was traveling in the polls behind the Republican former state senator mark gun levy and now that race has tightened political rights that Republicans it sure is\nInto the weirdest least predictable campaign in the country and to catch him in as a state government and politics reporter at Katy oh and Alaska Public media Hi Andrew\nHi Robyn so if you're going to have a weird race let it be the weirdest and this sounds like it and just take us back a second because the sitting Governor Bill Walker is running mate who was his lieutenant governor ... a lot stepped down a week before the governor made his announcement that he wouldn't be running\nAnd I'm a lot resigned over in inappropriate comment to an unnamed woman did that anything to do with why a Governor Walker's stepped down or was it simply because as he said he felt he couldn't win and if the if the way race and he wanted to throw his support behind the Democrat\nHe really stopped because of the ... issue both he and baggage all along have wanted one or the other they both of one of the other to drop out um they're pretty similar on the issues there are some differences on social issues but walkers really downplayed social issues as governor and has really focused on\nEconomic and non social issues so in practical terms there wasn't a lot of difference between the two of them and they were pretty evenly splitting the non Republican vote\nYeah but then when mullah made that comment it seemed to be um the time to make an exit look or just after Walker left the race in Alaska survey research full had done levy the Republican up only four points in higher so uh talk about how this racist changed\n[noise] yeah so a challenge for baggage is Walker's name is still on the ballot even though he suspended his campaign it happened after the withdrawal deadline and there isn't a lot of precedents for having an incumbent governor name on the ballot\nAnd then not campaigning so as you could imagine if you get five percent if he gets ten percent that's largely going to be votes coming out of\nBaggage is likely voters an enemy get those votes just because people either aren't informed about the latest news or they really like Walker and they don't like the other two names on the ballot\nYeah well so that they again that's what makes this so weird is that they could still could look really good in the polls\nBut ah we'll have to wait till we get out the other side on November six to see what people actually did it let's talk about the candidates a Walker again who's no longer in the race he sided

is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL around explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also banned vaping in the workplace\nOr you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the rivers and commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable I think that what the constitution revision commission did is it\nPacked things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's how Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandated State Department of veteran affairs mandate is the anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county that have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda if it's sandwiched in between motherhood Napa by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom than some legal experts see it this time is different\nTwenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans that men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not Emery ... was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection ...\nOffers the example of amendment ... which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a U.S make our environment where family and and and protect our state and protect ourselves\nTogether I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beans and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the lord of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible and so the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot\nThree other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they are voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters the where for\nHere and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there\nAre a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives\nThere an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number of statewide measure is has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature petition signed by registered voters and in\nThose citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past\nDo they become law or is it something that just gets referred to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty eight team um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections\nAnd voting yeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year\nUh other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri how difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThe process varies by state the number of signatures required as usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual an industry or a special group but a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on about\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process is a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has he they're not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove the rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process of used when the policies are being approved and the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decides that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there all the page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about that's implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty sixty initiatives was in many cases to either repeal or I'm changing the initiatives if possible in some states allow that some don't\nOr to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty Eighteen with an issue proponents instead of letting him go to the ballot and letting it be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where an issue opponents withdraw and the policy still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it\nWhat is the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the U. S. um every state but Delaware's a forty nine states\nRequire voters to ratify constitutional amendments so even if the legislature puts it on the ballot the voters still have to vote on it the question really comes down to win the argument is about citizen initiated measures where\nYou know in industry or a corporation or an out of state interest or grassroots volunteer efforts can put a measure on the ballot by collecting a certain number of signatures\nPatriots Subaru of an A. dot com\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB you are Boston and your NPR station\nFrom constant contact who segmentation feature allows small businesses to deliver personalized email campaigns to connect with our customers learn more in constant contact dot com\nAnd fracture creating frame lists photo decor and gifts by printing digital photos directly on glass a fracture is imaging mountain one available in the selection of ready to display sizes learn more at fracture me dot com slash here and now\nIt's here and now and we're following a story involving special counsel Robert Mueller and it's not about the results of his investigation into Russian interference in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations mothers office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him NPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who called herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr or is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that neither was to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in a special counsel's office that it it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask you about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI\nCan well there are two conservative media personalities Jacob all and Jack Bergman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Ruddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the ...\nBackground for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving putative misconduct by Mahler um they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report that was linked to a so called\nA intelligence agency which in its way which kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified a because no one knows which things into their true and which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors or models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women to say something about ... I mean what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap to try to get reporters\nTo talk about them or none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office has has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nIn a bottle in other words if somebody was masking a masquerading as a woman saying that they were sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nWell meanwhile earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have an immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lives are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believe they'd have to leave the United states he\nWind Robby is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan it say recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago was prepared to lose or temporary protected status on November second which had been the deadline she joined us in the studio welcome\nThank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U. S. under this temporary protected status I have been here since Nineteen Ninety seven so it's twenty Twenty one years\nI'm I'm not going to ask at age but it feels as if that would be a good deal of your life yes that's a big chunk of my life and you haven't returned to sit in during that time now so I Know you can't talk about why you came here because you have an asylum case that is correct\nWhat kind of life had you created here in the United states\nUh United States has been very kind to me [noise] I yeah I was able to say that my kitchen I have a master's degree from Isaac from Brandeis University I\nWorked with the department of public health at as a healthy Decatur for Eighteen years\nAnd right now I work with western governors the ... an online to schools that is based in Utah right now I'm working with him as an ... so we provide at cutting make a technique I help on line for just yet\nWilling we should note that since it's a sensitive subject for TPS holders did the government didn't pay for your education you pay for that yourself so having crafted that life you know find yourself in Brussels in an asylum case whether or not you can receive asylum in this country and you were under\nYour status would be ended and lost terrifying [laughter] us\nThey're finding accurate it ah it it's um\nI have been here for Twenty one years and when you live in a place for so long it becomes home you can live ... I don't have kids but I Know so many of the biggest holders who are raising up gets here a\nCommunity here yes I mean so I think the estimate is close to four hundred thousand people who are TPS Honda's right now he's the United states from different countries yeah yeah\nDo I understand you that you actually starting to prepare for having perhaps to leave by the end of this week that you shut things down I mean what did you do thinking you might have to leave\nIt is that is true 'cause I I used to own that is to rent it to a gym that I wanted for so long and I was it was like you said to him in twenty Fifteen I bought a restaurant and ah when did this has been ...\nI had to take steps that I didn't think I wouldn't need to do which is\nI had a soldier I started actually and so there's some because I wasn't sure if it ... it will be here demanded satirists and\nUm I was terrified that I'm going to also lose my job right now I was interested in because I'm with GPS a deadline everything stops so driver's license work everything that you have stopped with a constellation of ... as\nIt was a roller coaster it was really terrified\nSo you've already sold your business you say is your dream and then you were looking ahead and thinking boy on November second I Would lose as you said my license everything that enables me to function and possibly your other job which is working with this on line university yeah\nSo that had to be a a frightening time to can you understand I mean President Trump and the Trump administration's rationale for terminating temporary protected status for Sudanese immigrants like yourself\nIs that Sudan is no longer a dangerous place to live according to them the less civil war is over\nYou say what does have it on my might be over in the headlines but the situation is a ground is not that is not that great\nAnd again you were here throughout a time where you could not have gone back at all I'm no legal up until this change in American policy\nOr you were part of the lawsuit that resulted in the Trump administration's decision being blocked you took this before that judge that overturn that November second date but there could be another date are you still living in fear that you know any day now this could happen\nYes because ah just decision ... until the judge decides on that case and um this is not find a solution to our status\nThat's why we're hoping that Congress would look into this and give it give us a chance if they'd give us a thoughtful look say we see that as well those are really very integrated into American society and we are business owners we are uh your colleagues at work\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't readers of that law to simulate somewhere accelerating the pace of engineering and science and learn more and now we're not income from NPR and W.

said you know anything could happen in ... we've seen in the last two weeks they can you know two weeks ago we were seeing the Republican rebound after the Kavanaugh hearings than in the last week we've seen a pipe bomb mail campaign from the Trump supporter\nA shooting at targeting of blacks my white men and Louisville, Kentucky a flood of Jews at a synagogue on Fox News Monday Night president ... refer to the twenty Fifteen Charles\n\nFunding for here and now comes from fracture creating frame Lewis photo decor and gifts by printing digital photos directly on glass a fracture is image and

essay about a young man who committed suicide in Las Vegas\nJon ultimately submitted that essay to the San Francisco magazine the believer and this was launched a seven year holy war over facts they gotta an ss said facts could be fluent it was the impact of the story that mattered\nHis fact checker Jim single took a binary approach something was a factor or wasn't and facts were sacred soon single produce Ninety pages of inaccuracies which the two turned into a book with email exchange just like the following limited by our colleagues\nSingle questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John the guy that said it was nine seconds but the car and said it was eight\nYeah I ... that it doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them in the fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make some of the leaders themes in the essay work\nJohn changing details about stuff like Tabasco sauce bottles and thermometers is one thing but it seems a tad unethical to fiddle with details that relate directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical particularly because I wasn't um\nWhy it was parents also as soon as he had fallen for nine seconds\nBut now you do no better so shouldn't change\nNine is to integral part of the yesterday at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway\nSo the answer is not changing it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact with powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John Deere gotta\nHarry Potter I mean Daniel Radcliffe as fact checker Jim single and cherry Jones as an editor referee the to the seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the three are trapped in an apartment like caged cougars\nBattling sometimes physically over the meaning of fact as a deadline looms which side will win will editor cherry Jones publish it you know find out [noise]\n\nWe met up backstage was all for you before recent matinee as veterans of the stage can you feel what we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of their seat it's like I I don't want to try to outdo the critics here was describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ...\nYeah thank you it feels like we're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take him on there and just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company of easy for the first time ...\nAnd yeah I mean I I've never done a play before that has an argument at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment to some of gyms ... like make the audience go oh this guy's being ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous until I find like as far as you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going yeah we did when when you would make a point did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players have to be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of cars they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I heard people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty literally thirty of his relatives who've flown in from all over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they kindly gave us for opening night Jim's comments was man we could use to\nUse your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's a ... she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and damage damage every night is I come down to the moment is to play were decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone wow it's who convinces me\nOther so often you if you publish Eleanor every night and the other guy that's got to be talking about post show deeper\nBringing money [laughter] there was single wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I can talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah\nThirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or\nNews conference between them is a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs really different to be the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play\nWhere there is a difference in our and artistic peace being written record you know what would you say about the Greek histories what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Ghana you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four 'cause you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to set your character is not a bad guy we're in real life\nGuide anyway he's just he's a writer in order\nTo be a life he he has said that the real writer who said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroyed and they continue to do so um but I don't think it's fair John does it work for the Washington Post he was not writing articles for writing articles for\nNew York times used used illuminating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that falls in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nWith the whole world that facts to choose from the wrong stocks getting the way of the story\nAnd your test us as the wrong side what does that mean exactly what\nYou gotta be aware that we have a presidential spokes person Kellyanne Conway you spoke of alternative facts are not very\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and frequently gets applause\nThe argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in at the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where would the Beijing about the length of time this person fell for not one of those moments of the audience is kind of going oh come on clearly you are going to follow this you know the difference the masses you know Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating I certainly do you think will start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense you\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of fact and cherry again there you are in the middle talk about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance is the\nName of strangling each Oh yes yes I'm ready no winning that fight [laughter] I saw the U.S strongly dinner\nYeah it does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way\nBut then you you actually got a taste of this she went to the New Yorker and you were fact checker for a day to barely hands shaking on your red and you made a call you had to call the restaurant tour after someone wrote a review yes so you had to check the description of the food and\nAs I was doing I was like well I guess every ingredient mentioned as a Fox so I'm just going to have to also came about every single ingredient as mentioned it and I only missed one they were ready to\nIn fact you missed our men\nBut now I Know ... ... s a restaurant Oh yes yes I did an underlying restaurants which I should have because I should have checked if it was in fact Pluto and he had had two previous restaurants or one previous restaurant\nI have to ask you are actors you've all been written about do you come away from this play feeling better about the press more frightened about the press on my God if there are only thirty one strip clubs and we're writing thirty four\nYou've got to read listen see with your eyes as much as you possibly can and these days and then check and fact check\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and your NPR station\nPosters Smith printing

com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state\nAnd how did the Ninety nine the reason by the way that they're Ninety nine is because one state the brass guy does not have both the house and Senate they only have one chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the state level\nWell well what the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight and in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes uh they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on\nTaxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and uh and and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care at a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy even coming from Washington on the federal level\nAnd so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in ads if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct and in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines\nAnd in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and a stages and they had a very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that and um and so they drew lines that were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade\nBut yes the the twenty twenty cents as his right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled and less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as\nThirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know ... that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be that a democratic opportunity year they would have the windows their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans on for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of our legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds\nSo they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country and there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is ... since Nineteen hundred\nSo going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're putting into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... and states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year\nAnd despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislator who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do and um and then to your point it then it does sort of turned into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's also learned about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to ... million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle particularly on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how the\nRegistration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you know see\nFairly commonly pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they just increased fairly substantially for they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention\nTo the state races but both parties are going all in all of these races\nYou said President Obama said ... I remember President George W. Bush called the law says that he faced a thumping I think maybe it's now or something that the president has to do is come up with the word or for that first midterm election if it doesn't go out for their part yeah [laughter] yeah\nThat's a great that's a great point that you know if the Republicans\nI'm really take it on the chant in it and it turns into a a really bad night or a large a democratic night um then yeah they'll have to get creative get the word Smith is generating a dismal words that are whose analogous with Simon Cho lacking [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "31"}
