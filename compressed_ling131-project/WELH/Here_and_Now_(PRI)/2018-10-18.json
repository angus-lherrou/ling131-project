G\nSaudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman ... what do you think happened yet\nI mean I I don't actually know what happened you know there are rumors flying around the Turks claim that the Saudis killed him\nAnd chopped them up or the Saudis deny it I I don't know I mean clearly something did happen to him it is possible that the Saudis were trying to adopt him um they have had a history of doing that with a people they consider to be dissidents and they definitely considered your mouth to be a dissidents\nYou know it may it may have been an abduction that went wrong or they may have actually wanted to kill him and and they're constantly which is a really bizarre thing and and stupid thing to do in criminal thing of course\nWell what do you think of the audio recordings that turkey has released a details of which claimed to give evidence that ... was killed was headed and killed in a very gruesome manner\nWell I mean a couple of things first if the Turks have audio recordings then they probably had the consulate bugged\nWhich is problematic the second um you know the Turks are not are geopolitical rivals with Saudi Arabia and they don't treat their journalists very well at all in fact there are thousands of them were in prison and some who have been disappeared so I don't trust what they say I Would like to hear the audio recording that would be nice if\nThey would release it to let's say the Washington Post the journal that Jamal wrote in and then we could make an independent assessment of ... and ... and by the way if that recording does exist and if the Saudis did do that\nThen that is just a heinous heinous crime and somebody should definitely pay the price ...\nThe New York times I did have a story today that finds that intelligence agencies here in the United states are nearly convinced\nThat show was killed in at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia was involved they apparently have intercepted Saudi officials discussing a possible plan to detain ... there are a number of Saudi men that turkey says came to the Saturday consulate around the time of the disappeared I mean what do you make of that that that's no these are\nAll day and you know all the all the rumors and all the\n... which is what all these are certainly make Saudi Arabia look very bad and it's not good for the Saudis and what the Saudis should have done from the beginning was to present credible evidence that proves that they didn't do it and they have not done that and I really am puzzled as to why they've been quiet for over two weeks now\nOf the public radio\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

handful of people and they only know Sally Field because of her you really liked me acceptance speech first that's not what she said and she says now which he was trying to say was that maybe with two Oscars she finally put the flying none and what she called her an orthodox career behind her\nAnd I want to do anything to have you respect it first time I didn't feel it and I [noise]\nNow after Robert\nDuvall hands or that after\nAnd this is really weird because he was then my sister's husband we were there you are yes and you came up this day and you stepped into the elevator and we were the only ones in the elevator and you said how did I Do\n[noise] and we said you were magnificent well there you go [laughter]\nThat was the first year that we're doing the red light and was flashing in my face so it wasn't eloquent but it was what I felt you know\n[laughter] well um it's not even in this book because there's so much else it's a story of a childhood in California your mother of beautiful women um your dad came home from the war they divorced and enter her second husband your stepfather\nA a charismatic\nForce of nature stunt man\nWho went on to use you as a child\nAnd it's a stunning revelation why\nHow did you come to write about this [noise] well so\nMy ... my mother passed away on my sixty fifth birthday I thought I had done all the right things you know I had the conversations and we'd had moments together of feeling that every thing that might have been bad was gone\nBut when she was gone I felt so deeply disquiet it something growing on me like there was a of wounds festering and I didn't know where it was and I didn't know how to find it\nThan a friend asked Sallie issues going to attend a noted women's conference she was\nAnd she said well that's really good because I Want you to give the keynote address [noise] I said I Can't I Can't possibly do that I Can't I Can't give the keynote address I I I Can't I have nothing to say and she said yes\nYou do and I thought yes I Do Oh yes I Do\nAnd it took me seven years you take us into how this could happen that your stepfather was sexually abusing you and nobody knew and into what you describe as your dislocation sort of separate yourself from that then there's of an odd dislocation for the rest of your life um\nThere's a saying that what's fired together is wired together\nSo that when my stepfather came in and picked me up and held me and he was big and bold and loud and I was tiny and shy and frightened and and I wanted my mother to take me into her arms and put me safely on her hip but I could sense she wanted me to\nShow that I was happy in his arms because\nShe needed him to be pleased and and I was being seen I was being held and seemingly adored\nI this must be loves\nAnd yet I'm terrified so early on in my life those two things got wired together love\nAnd terror understanding them mechanisms that I used to survive I'm and how they served me for so long in my early career they serve me but I had to leave them so that I could then try at Seventy two to leave them behind ... you\nHad a boyfriend Steve who became the first husband who helps uh a dysfunctional family function that you became pregnant ended up in Mexico and it sounded like I have and again that felt like a dislocation like this ... this isn't ... this can't be happening and six weeks later you're ...\nI was in pieces when things would happen I'm at seven and eight and nine and ten that were just too much for me to handle\nI learned to send myself out of the room that terror was not there and the sadness was not there the rage was not there and the part of me that was the taskmaster could stay and do the tasks that were required and as I started my early career\nThe parts of me that were overwhelmed luckily when I was twelve years old I found a stage I went to a public school and the San Fernando valley and they had a theater arts department and I did my first scene when I was twelve years old and ban\nSomething cleared bell rang everything was quiet\nI could hear myself something that happens when you're really in a craft\nAnd you're not in your body anymore so that when hand in hand with coming out of being in the kind of traumatic childhood place that I was in but it was acting\nThen come civil the TV show based on the true story of the young woman with

I knew I knew her and I didn't connect with how deeply civil and I belong together and yet I knew so well how she glided from one character to the other but it took me till so recently to go\nOh oh oh\nI see you mean civil and I had very similar survival mechanisms ... doing that being in her shoes connecting with pieces of myself\nIt did change me at the end I had had moments in my life where rage took over and I would be so lost in absolute white rage that I didn't care if I Lived or died\nBut in acting and certainly in Norma I'm being the first place where I was able to\nConnect with the rage when I stood enormous shoes when I did all of the deep work that I had to do to understand her I heard my own voice\nIt's a voice that is no race of course audience members wanted to know what Sally Field thought of the me too movement and the recent confirmation hearings with descriptions of drunk and loud dish behavior\nMay not going to it's it's um it doesn't surprise me I don't they get surprised any of us but I think were enraged I think it's time to get mad we have to stay mad [noise]\n[noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

see may generous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now\nThank you so you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos text videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime are nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside and looking up will help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other and it's just a tiny bit more connected around the planet\nSo you know some people will look up at this guy and they will fill love they'll fill wholesale fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive\nAnd how they express that is what we want to capture and we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to\nTake these photos and you've got to put them up but were then to display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at that can expand they can go to different folks around the world so I can no\nHouston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of\nMy guy period yeah nice guy right in a nice guy\nWell but but in the sky period and and and the last uh you know a couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus and I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I asked\nThat that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut what I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were say what people are where even seen our impact\nOn this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars right but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth's when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere it's this planet that warns us in cools us in enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nWill so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well\nI Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we had these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster we really care about each other but that carried only happens\nWhen we're come face to face that I can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to the sky something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you know as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise] no I actually\nHave a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ads that we have that's completely free we're calling it a sky feet at Wright is a sky selfie [laughter] and that's sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to\nYou're the principle of one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve or do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years so let's\nI Want to hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to sit right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really changed fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form and what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out how as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through pollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happened to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number a small number but a number of African American women who have\nGone into space but you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you so\nIt it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in the space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up but being that\nBeing the first one was covering the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket scientist to suit technicians you know are being a crew members to involve them in space exploration\nYet even as a sport it is making sure that we understand that individuals on this planet have a right to be involved with space exploration that they understand the impact of this technology and how profound that can be to help us build a better world\nYou want to go back into space again well you know what we're in space right now [laughter] [laughter] and if you look at the sky tapestry would let you rotate\n\n[noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from network readers

give the Saudis more time to finish investigating the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal ... before the United states decides how to respond\nI think it's important for us all to remember to where I Belong to a scientific thirty two old along strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia they continue to be important counterterrorism partner\nOr they have custody of the two holy sites are there and important strategic alliance of the United states so we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us to talk about that is Robyn fires that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S import from Saudi Arabia\nLook that's about Thirteen million dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of hold the hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis they really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar\nSo it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective for\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars of arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this\nFrom a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on the seven hundred club\nWe'd rather an arm of the everybody on a piece of this like one of the honor Nineteen billion dollars is huge and they don't mean a lot of jobs and it'll be a lot of money coming to our coffers and uh it's not something that you don't want to blow up William LA\nSo Pat Robertson they're telling President Trump maybe not to go too tough on the Saudis if it is found that they have something to do with a ... death\nSaudi Arabia still counts for less than one percent of United States international trade through this summer and when you look at arm's you see that hundred billion dollar figure bandied about it's actually three point two billion dollars of defense exports I think the president and the secretary of state the kind of want to secure this great relationship and that\nTrump went to Riyadh he posted the Saudi prince here and you have these enormous sales and that stuff that he could sell to defense contractors in a in a midterm election year in reality the numbers are far smaller on an annual was basis\nOne other thing I Want to ask you about is the tech industry um we we were hearing that Hoover has a big investment from Saudi Arabia we remember that when you on mosque

L. in Urbana, Illinois Dick welcome back\nJeremy it's great to be back thank you\nThank you wanted us to start with the menu at from the string quintet in eat major this is played by the Smithsonian Chamber Players [noise]\n[noise]\nVery familiar tune that this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killers about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this and a lot of movies since then tell us about it\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... could really have in the day for his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late Nineteen century\n... they were arrangements that were made this piece went viral in its time you could say there were range means for\nA Mandel lesions for piano for saxophone for ... choir with a Latin text added\nSo this piece has been popular will before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killers and to use in the film this was a word that's written for a string quartet to find Lynn's viola\nShallow was an additional cello no there is a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola\nAnd not with a cello so somebody should have been on to this young guys you're walking around without a second child has\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is ... stay off this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago and try to get in [laughter] whether or not supposed to be but it's it's been in a lot uh\nOne of us in actually to another version of the same piece this is the saint Paul chamber orchestra with Bobby McFerrin conducting and on ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYou know when I said Bobby McFerrin unfair because I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have it he's not singing necessarily but he is a humming along to the to the tune Bobby McFerrin\nIs being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating ah arrangements for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string queen tests this is one simple minuet from one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore he was ...\nSymphony or if it's funny there's a contemporary book reading violinist composer ... ... and his famous wind\nThat if the almighty wish to speak through music it would be that of heightened if the almighty wish to listen to music we'd be data book read and book really had that gift for melody in had the gift for the detail and you can hear that just in this a portion of the symphony number three ...\nWhy do you think then that he is not as well known as Mozart Beethoven Chopin Tchaikovsky and others\nIt could be that most of his music his chamber music\nAnd I would say that the appeal of chamber music is not as great as see the appeal\nFor orchestral music and it's not that he didn't write orchestral music and I think it's becoming a little bit better known but I think compared to those other composers ah there isn't as much of it and I think that's one of the reasons why it's not as popular in our time\nAs a victory ... who is host of classic mornings and W.
