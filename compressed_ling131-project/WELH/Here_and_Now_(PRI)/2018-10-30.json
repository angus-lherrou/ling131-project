S.\nAnd Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now as Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today Hi Allan Hi German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which are reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and of the state where in their reside\nSo how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\nVery good question um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act the Eighteen sixties sex and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight but\nQuote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo it's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the phrasing that you said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who was an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here um through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant\nGiving birth here just so that their child has US citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle to climb\nWell there are many who will look at this and say we're a week before the midterm elections and this is just a political move that he wants to excite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nYeah the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant care of and coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring it a national emergency and just this week that his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nActive duty military troops down to the U.S border to stop them that's on top of already Twenty one hundred national guardsmen\nThat are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up I'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this was a strategy that worked for him obviously in twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave\nIn this midterm election\nHe's just going back to the playbook that worked for him and saying hey let's just hammer down on immigration over and over and see if that works\nAnd those migrants ah that you're talking about by the way there are over a month away from the United states by walking and that's if they go about thirty miles per day\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

hundred nine four seven auto\nThis year and now we had the rare opportunity last week to speak with Alan Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember short term interest rates and that's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and said the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with them about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America history which he co authored with Adrian ... rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related to a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which\nAre very old Silicon Valley for example is a classic case of who very new\nThere are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether you Gregory in areas where it was sort of being prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast through\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices everyone talks about so the only thing about this country which is very diverse out of the ... where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge of this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand four increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell on the lookout into the future or we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity flight well basically because fear\nYou know when you deal with fear it is very difficult to classify it\nBut you can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment um uh just inclination to take risks in the book\nOutlook is all about oh we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements as having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nThe reason for that is what the data under critically show is that in title ... which are mandated by law a gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings and the economy\nDollar for dollar and so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this is largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging right now the official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds\nAnd balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent indefinitely into the future to do you think they should do that\n[laughter] first of all do I think it's going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it it could cause the debt overall total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nWhen you say inflation it it it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates since ... century bc Greece but not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we kept rates low as ... own employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace than the dot com boom which now moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation\nOf like four percent but with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand I think\nThat what we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand method is there a two conditions as quiet for a crisis\nOne is there a toxic assets like a\nSecure dies two mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and one day a finance\nThat's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell general now that that was the extraordinary period in court narrowed it it would have been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was there\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nA for jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire\nAre having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity but it's an issue or when you get the sort of tight labor market\nWage rates begin to rise of necessity and it's the wage rate rises which affect the cost of production\nAnd hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because the costs are going up that's where the problem is that hasn't really been growing up\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talked about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all I explain what that means\nA creative destruction is a process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing\nOlder equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process which are unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth in standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture it to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically this report died in the book is the result of creative destruction which means essentially for example when a\n... open hearth ... been in the steel industry a whole slew of procedures within the steel industry so quote best of my friends\nThey became obsolete and they were scrapped but also workers associated with those particular furnaces so to speak they lose their jobs so that the the legal forces continuously changing\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and from Geico offering the guy called mobile lap\nThe guy called mobile

was eighty six Daniel Stein aged Seventy one Melvin wax\nEighty eight and are being younger was sixty nine\nThey all spent time in the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish\nBut it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making a show a show we wish we had to help us through a week like this\nWere British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us\nFrom ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell they this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that ... the community that diverse can diversity in the community if we're all hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and\nI'm noticing the trees and and the various temples and synagogues and churches um that all made him feel at home um that bakeries that delicatessens and he often comment at the click here yet ... fever and it doesn't have a language is spoken\nAnd walk down the street that community\nHe actually learned he Brittany pay get gas or do you think that\nTelevision was based on scroll hill\n[noise] um\nThe the Mr Roger's neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighbor but the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community and probably ... electrodes community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ever live\nIs assassination me\n[noise]\nHave you heard that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it meant\nWell it means [noise] somebody getting killed in a\nSort of surprised way that's what happened\nYou know stand and killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about a lot of people are sad scared about it you know [noise]\nI'd rather talk about some other day and have you like [noise]\nThat sound or courtesy of the Fred Rogers company laid ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic or she says that's okay\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] I think one of the things that you taught us all lift that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid and there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to Graham naps where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the help ... the the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances that doctors the nurses everyone\nUm has surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who are cause destruction\nI've seen a line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days look for the helpers yes\n[noise] as part of that same special or that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence locals and\nI've been terribly concerned about the graphic display of violence\nMedia has been showing recently and I played for your protection in support of your young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child to say without it being overwhelming\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of us to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but he also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make good next attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message so looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFor grabs you said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean the fly simply hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children ... and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way\nWere British ... what do you think Fred Rogers new new Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think he would be horrified by what happened in ... and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people\nUm and I you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also said we need to turn to our neighbors and neighbor in the greatest sense of the world's everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds some all faiths of all races I'm so that we can live together on this earth and very productive ways\nWhat's this been like for you living right they're outside of Pittsburgh\nUh it's um but it's been very hard I've been I'm meeting and talking with some of the teachers um in early childhood programs to make my own background to try to develop an early childhood and so I've been talking to some of the teachers and the directors\nOf programs um some of the the the Jewish

describing himself that\nWay actually but that you know the thing with Cordray is he's he's very majored in what he says people here know and he served as a state lawmaker he served in state treasurer he's served and say gee and then as you said he served in the federal level\nHe's been out of state for a while but now he's back running for governor\nA and he is a coming in saying he wants to uphold the Affordable CARE Act he has a a comprehensive bond package or for road repair and infrastructure improvements so that's that's where he's running\nRight okay and Mike DeWine is the

him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot

the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation are if so what we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day\nOf because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it with you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but\nAh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for\nThem is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nWell it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters of we do have in this election that can vote and\nVoting numbers are up over where they weren't the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal in Ohio\nAnd that is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at at the ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to fly out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good opportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I had some effect on it\nThat's showing goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven Macs a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning\nThe plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta investigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash\nJoining us to have sex Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people\nAre saying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nMore than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know is that the played into this you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going\nYou could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened you're my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the ... of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issue some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was\nWhat are called the ... tubes or which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so a very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that it'll slated flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new are planted flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flowing on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max eight is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nOf flying you know for that matter airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border\nAnd and you know of course this is also very\nThis point you ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened ah but you know the newness of an airplane in and of itself shouldn't cause something any more than ... you know a very old airplane as long as it's maintained properly\nBut we're not talking here nobody is talking about pilot error nobody is talking about whether or anything like that they're they're looking investigated it appears or looking mostly just at the mechanics of this airplane\nRight and you know the biggest question of all if we're going to be talking about the human error might not be those pilots on board again in all of this very
