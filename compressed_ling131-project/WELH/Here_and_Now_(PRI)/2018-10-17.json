sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he profiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nBen Bradlee junior welcome to here and now\nThat you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania\nThis is a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre uh it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which\nIs a traditionally democratic county had voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior President Obama want it to time President Obama won it twice\nBut its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county\nThat it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went down\nInitially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host and learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them when one person a region to another\nAnd ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but it's settled on twelve a who stories I decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that\nAt least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened and\nYou talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple related will speak like huge big league or big league may have turned up voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Missouri and county but I think people base\nMost of their vote for president on the extent to which\nI think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settle on a generally like Trump on most issues but really liked his style they just like to use a is moxie his feisty and that's how he gets up every morning and I'm ... has a tweet storm\nAnd I'm six it to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was\nNot what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in ... county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is like not actually going to build the wall but he's going to he's going to beef up\nThe wall yeah the interesting they talked about the importance of decoding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nA what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the practice job the candidate says something in the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you're really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising are evangelical population\nTrump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's appointed\nEvangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business\nAs sexually much ado about nothing that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices what\nAbout just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty eight teen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county even if you\nDon't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and or the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a fix that sort of an enormous problem and just try and\nBut it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county and young people are leaving this brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond maintenance and uh working in warehouses a minimum wage jobs\nAnd did they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins are the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign\nHe hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nWith the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no I'm neither Trump or the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan he said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nAgo not the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care about\nWhat about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able\nTo do they don't seem to really care and the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over ... and everything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like those are in county well they certainly did and\nThe twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats a lot of people that I talked to were Democrats but felt that the party had left them rather than they are leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms\nWell if I had to guess I Would think the um this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats did we take the house but not the Senate\nThen by the junior one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse into the minds of many people who voted for Trump but\nDid so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the um reporting even on people in the middle of the country that's coming from reporters and and and others on the coasts tests to look down on on them you didn't do that here\nThis Saturday of about ... in Providence a casual rush hour

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school um that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school we\nTurn to Dr Beverly ... she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of stone in college and historically black college for women that container and the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts\n[noise] um I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of evidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening\nOne of the things that's happening is that changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school and\nBehaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior slain that\nSure well if I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white\nBut that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThen you are likely to think doing well in school being in that honors track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation with in\nRacially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper tracks you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably\nYours in your book but to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores still not be placed so what do we do [laughter]\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counsel for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also new not ... but you write another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school\nA majority white and a teacher saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that it has and\nThe dance that she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which adds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly yeah you have things like that\nGoing on to unintentional yes unintentional I mean that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected to stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had\nWait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his whole room it sounds like that there isn't it\nBut what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically and also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more support it they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and and be more focused in class\nBy the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asks why the white kid in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together and the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nJust such an odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedians they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young blacks to see that\nWell it's true I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to the music becomes mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by white teens as well as kids of color um those are physical symbols\nThat many people recognize and appreciate but at the same time you can be a young African American sitting and Starbucks and have somebody called the police on you know something that's\nBeverly Daniel Tatum former president of Spelman College the country's

place in dance\nThat because he was decided as one of the twenty century the most powerful story there's two ... out of the more abstract will the twenty century ballet [noise] second tier Jewish balance sheet this late Russia's going choreographer and cofounder of the New York city ballet who hired\nA thirty one year old ... in Nineteen forty nine to be that companies associate artistic director\nAuthor Wendy lesser says she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing myth about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when you less You're welcome thank you for having me rather than just you know thinking\nNow in our minds you write attended I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because Jerome Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing noticed them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story in the masterpiece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that\nUh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I think it will be\nFabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University press is Jewish lives series for the hundreds centennial a journal Robbins birth\nCertainly knew about his works as we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it John Robbins Nineteen Seventy one valley Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from box let's just listen to them\nAll\n\nK so we will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every\nKind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial quarterly friendly formal it was just\nAn amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about peace advanced than to say\nThat had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nBy and you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because he was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah drought excellent biographies two of them and they both\nMentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had panned it and that she was the most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes [noise] uh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called you or Robbins affects all angry man that was later but\nFord appointed lawyer [laughter] you were going up from Robbins worth as a belly choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much as well as we can hear now that the word afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of Davy see I'm willing to do the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina ten appeal to click penny\nRobbins muse and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\nOr or\n\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise]\nWell I I just loved the stamps and it's only about ten minutes\nTwelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful Everytime [noise] it's not just a reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has\nPriest is is dancing around and stuff but he's practically a solar\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a ...\nWonderful to ... I think we're it simultaneously [noise] about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fond and his dream girl who\nComes and visit him and with those two dancers ... was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves into practice mirrors that is what it\nFeels like and we are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in the mirror as\nDancers sometimes do in a studio so that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them anyway\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had applied he was balancing loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and found\nShe said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly\nPopcorn and that's probably drove others you know off the cliff it looks a little dances\nAt a gathering this is a the dance Robin creates a Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing three I can see for Broadway but this stance is at a gathering with an instant had\n\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day\nDance to the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage after\nMany many minutes at a you know quite a long ballet of all the dancers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon on a combination of\nA work that meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n... uh you talked about his childhood which was difficult ... relationship with his mother um and he became difficult there's a famous and dance circles story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to\nHe's backing up backing up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the ... and no one comes to help them ... he you know can be cruel\nYes and ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was and not just of the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing west side story in Washington in a theater and Leonard Bernstein was sitting there near the front of the theater listening to play his music\nAdler is all ride dotcom down the street from rusty Jacobs [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and your NPR station\nFrom

and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nTo secure now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty sixteen\nAt the appropriate time I will release them but right now under routine order nobody cares still or cares is you know you and a few people that is in question obviously the public didn't care because I Won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns\nWell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall on the German away from age just stop your lane and get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law in taxation at the University of Virginia school of law and former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now\nHi Jeremy [noise] so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress to request the tax return information of any person or any business\nAnd directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a pond receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner um but it can appoint agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house\nFirst to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house is not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol leave the Senate could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation\nTo submit any of the information that its obtain to the full house or the full Senate and presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of reasons um could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is the tax committee and so it certainly could be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function\nOr the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories or New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story yes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly\nIt's doing and why it's searching it but I I think I could come up with some\nPurposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances or the law prior to this law\nAllowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress in the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials\nOf the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president didn't get a tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executive under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon\nWho um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or place in a blind trust\nHis business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nAh the the the ... that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing industry ration push through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well that's\nA tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest and their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut if President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about it\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more as in terms of character simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be\nFairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that the president has a lot of authority to undertake various\nThe question is what are the these decisions and is there some personal or business interest on the part of some of the decision making going on\nI Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people and the public and if they wanted to know that that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income\nYeah although I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the member of the public might think of that is you know how rich you are and and how much and so forth\nBecause a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income\nAnd so uh the return may not really show I mean it may show a relatively modest amount a taxable income and in fact as you say and they show little or no taxes paid", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence",
