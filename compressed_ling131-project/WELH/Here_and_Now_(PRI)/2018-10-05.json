ah so did the they will be a waiting game just on these two because that's that's the narrow math and this extraordinarily partisan environment\nJesse where's the pressure greater from the right of pushing the senators especially the Republican senators to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh or from the left people that are very angry at what they see as an incomplete\nFBI investigation and an angry testimony from him and perhaps that he doesn't have the right temperament to be a Supreme Court justice\nWell for her columns and mentioned it's a it's a no win situation for either one of them is

know we almost get numb to these pictures of toppled homes in buckled roads and smashed cars in body bags um but you know what how do you take that and\nYou know you take it in with personal stories of people you take it in with the man who sits and describes to you and he's had with a far\nOff looking as I um this complete conflict that he has inside his his self that he ... that that he survived but at what cost he kept saying things like it you you may think we were selfish when we just ran\nUm because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left the father behind he said he was he was praying and his house he said we had seconds to to get out um and they were of luckily on the street he looked up germs or saw wall of water coming at them\nAnd just ran its you know in some ways it's it's so serendipitous and miraculous that people survive these these sorts of events because this this uh sue nominee is coming at them like a locomotive and it's just building

the United states is not the only country dealing with political polarization Sunday's election in Brazil is expected to be the country's most polarized vote in decades\nThere's widespread distrust among the electorate because a record number of lawmakers have been caught up in a massive corruption scandal polls show that's driving voters too far left and far right candidate joining us now from Rio de Janeiro is Tim Franks of the BBC Tim or what's at stake in this election in Brazil\nFor other people do say that\nDemocracy is at stake and the reason\nThey will say that particularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign to go to the opinion polls that they said because he ... he's a fall right policemen as sort of sprung from ...\nAh he's a threat to the Democratic booms in Brazil and this is just says he is the men but from when there was a military dictatorship here so vote democracy is ... his country\nPeople they take it for granted equally supportive of Mr ... and already said that they are the ones who have been rescued Brazil plug choose all the people who have been responsible for\nA surge in crime a surgeon corruption and the worst recession that the country\nYou know Brazil is on the mortal threat if the left gas and hence Europe's he writes about ... but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be more fruits\nAnd we should also remember that two of the last few presidents or one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office yeah\nAnd that is what I'm depends a lot of the opposition to the main challenger to this fall right presidential candidate because the work is policy the P. T. to give it it's a Portuguese accident\nThey would impact two thousand and two ... two thousand and sixteen\nAnd all that watch\nThe largest corruption scandal\nThat Brazil is ever seen and and in fact he was a ... of Latin America at two groups and Lula president Damasio Lula da Silva who was a two term president in Brazil or the ... she had been hyping just feels him as a candidate in this election\nBut he was sentenced to twelve years in jail for corruption of you to see a and so they put up a they sell the Manson onto a dodgy who compared to ... more\nColors a lot less charismatic I Am the he's funny difficulties he's the second in the opinion polls at the moment but he's funny difficult to punch through against the the brush populism of ...\nOr people excited about this election or some people not even gonna bother to vote because of all this\nOther thing is either to be honest I think people are only tens of hooks about this election and I think a lot of people\nA feeling that so she's a state so having the rise of the choices facing them but they really have to choose it's apathy isn't\nIsn't an option and I think one of the key things that you have to remember here is that although an awful lot of people do feel very shy of ... is ... racist homophobic\nA man in the past has to warmly about dictatorship or even about those who tortured and killed for the state's\nLoss of people\nFeel very strongly that the workers policy has headaches shops in Brazil and home they watch\nCorruption crime and recession has been result so even though there will be plenty of people who feel that Mr personality doesn't speak for them\nStarting October eleventh damn theater dot org [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

on this process is going to continue throughout the day and and you could probably see that happen tomorrow as well\nRight That's NPR's Brakkton Booker outside the capital back then thank you thank you\nWell as we continue to follow everything with Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series\nThis week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen and joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHi how're you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know about her\nOh just a quick ... sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist\nShe lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada lets us into one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nThey call him senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada is no\nObject and you're right now actually support the piece of legislation to ensure that we should be the most Americans but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we're worried about you were there but you're going to be held her focus\nPromise and voted for repeal deciding district\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller it's a\nBig issue in those ads have seemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change that Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you've probably ought to tell people\nHis campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\nOr what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nI don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver telling me what\nYou're going to you in just still\nDean Heller and get things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans part in the past amounts and plenty an\nDelivered to predict the actual Dean Heller is our voice\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking in that had are women\nYeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the latest CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women\n[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally [noise]\nYeah no that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote on reliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste a for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed to reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called the peacemaker by the New York times he he called Heller and and and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's what the hell are seem to change his vote and um they adolescence in turn have given to his campaign war chest\nIs adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics\nHuge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on\nYour side in order to hold office there\n[noise] you know just this will be the ... election to see if that is the is the case\n[noise] ah any sense of how the cabin or a nomination fight as playing with voters in Nevada\nWell when the Heller said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a checkup it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Capitol hearing what\nWould you say the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November\nThis election is I think it's about the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will be on the minds of voters Democrats Republicans everything when they go to the polls because through his words his tweets his actions he has made politics about values\nAnd I think when people go to the polls they're going to think more about values than the economy than than foreign policy even more than a wide range of domestic issues up he's turned their focus to behavior and I think\n\nFunding for here

com\nThis this year and now Murphy Brown is back Twenty years after the Emmy winning sitcom went off the air CBS has revived it for an eleventh season Candice Bergen plays the older but still fast talking broadcast journalists to returns alongside the original cast NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about ...\nHey so Murphy Brown was always about mining politics for entertainment back in the day I had fans from both sides of the aisle Senator Orrin hatch Republican of Utah even sending a head shot hoping to make a guest appearances do you think it could have crossover appeal today or are they even making an effort no\nIn one word or you know I spoke to the show's creator and show runner Diane English in LA in July\nAnd basically she told me she didn't think they would be a show 'em there would be a revival or if if Trump hadn't been elected president\nUm she was a house supportive of a Hillary Clinton ran a pack a that was connected to her before the election had a huge party at our house ah\nAh for the election and had like two hundred bottles of champagne that she could no open when a Hillary Clinton didn't win and so uh seeing how they affect the Trump has had on politics on media especially ah she's got this\nTo be top journalist so of course pushing back against that has become one of the major themes in the revival of of Murphy Brown and because she's so close to Hillary Clinton of course she uh she got the former secretary of state or to actually make an appearance on the show so we've got a clip of that uh let's let's let's say\nAnd I also assume you've had previous secretary leaks theory absolutely for four years I was the secretary [noise] I like the secretary at a very large right [noise]\nAnd you have all the requisite skills computer nail emails [noise]\nI I Do have some experience with [noise]\nAlways makes you wonder if there's nothing again\nI get out [laughter] no I doubt it I don't think they would have brought up emails [laughter] editor right um it ... you know Hillary Clinton has been having some fun she was a she is also appeared in a an episode of a Madam Secretary that trauma\nUm alongside Colin Powell and I'm I'm a ... and uh other political so\nI'm ... this show has been very much about pushing back against Trump isn't the Murphy Brown revival\nAnd I'm In an in an episode um that just stared you know she sneaks into the White House briefing room and sort of pushes back some of the things they do so this shows very much about pushing back against Trump ism and pushing back against the monitors shape but the GOP so it it is not a bipartisan\nNow the original Murphy Brown went to war with Dan Quayle remember him a in a real life needs fiction moment during the Nineteen Ninety two presidential election Quayle made of family values speech where he criticized the character Murphy Brown\nFor having a child outside of marriage then the character Murphy round responded to quell criticisms in the show and now it seems like the show is trying to manufacture that same dynamic with President Trump\nYeah there there's a a there was a scene towards the end of the first episode of the revival where Trump was supposedly watching these fictional uh news characters on the air and tweeting about them and then they were reading the tweets in them responding to him I think\nWe have a ...\nTimes harder you were writing [noise]\n\n[laughter]\nSo of course a reference to wear a Murphy actually a delivered a very if of effective response to Dan Quayle back in the heyday of the show I think it was interesting to me I'm a you know I had mixed feelings about this a revival uh I didn't I found\nSome of the humor to be I'm kind of old fashioned and and some of the speech fine by the Murphy Brown character to be kind of a diabetic\nAnd in your face in a way that that uh that wasn't necessarily entertaining and and this bit at the end of the first episode of the revival felt like wishful thinking in a way like like you like you you like you kinda wish the show 'em ... these people making that kind of wish to show would be impactful enough\nThat Donald Trump would actually watch it in sort of tweet at them a while I was going on so uh so they actually made it happen within the confines of the show but um what's really happening is that there are so many people that have been saying things like this for so long on TV\nIncluding most of the late night comedians that we have you know Stephen ... Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that uh it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary\nOr it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think is left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times well\nAbout the idea also that this is yet another TV\nEr and bring back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stories and Boris politics\nUm there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense of\nAh friends had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows that are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI have swat have mcgyver\nAnd all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slapped living near the show a over it so I'm you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon ths at will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't minutes syndication for a long time so\nAh you know I don't think a lot of younger people we've are familiar with the show and because the the the ... version of it I'm Still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nSaid be our TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAnd again to our top story today the Senate advancing Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lobbed at Kavanaugh has prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct\nMost have changed significantly since back then but as NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go\nTo many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was in Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh when\nCentered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown ... current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women\nJohn Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge to him soul searching who's making a mistake schools have already\nChanged dramatically since the eighties Paul for he says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent and respect\nIt is changing but it's still a problem on campuses and I certainly can't say that we are out of ...\nSo saying all been school in D.C had to ... college yearbooks after discovering seniors at the elite all boys school had included crude and sexist slurs\nThat's way too recent this is very disturbing\nAttorney Eric Nick leash represents victims of sexual solved and there's also a sane all been alarm\nThat tells me that there is an issue with that school is really indefensible\nSaying all ovens declined to comment but in a letter to parents alumni the school apologized for the incidents and vowed to learn from past mistakes poll free from Philips Andover says some schools have been quicker than others to get with the program\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

sixty nine that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now how Mike Hi Germany well it certainly the number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streets\nWell right as you mentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know it's more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people are away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather\nUm and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nAbsolutely yeah and uh you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um\nSince two thousand and ten a the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get jobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where\nThe issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict do to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so it does it all sort of adds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now\nA ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet um but it's by all accounts are very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about and overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a for ... for many years now we're back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg News thank you thanks German\nPresident Trump is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and this John economy also came out that his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his late into one of the most highly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nIs supposed to be eight Democrats said\nI\nAm very surprised\nThat supply for\nRepublican Jim ... wins he's facing the Democrat Dan thin Bones Are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor so that district Israel return for this week's district profile captain Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joins us from my sister and\nSixteen but the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's a very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester in Maine Kato which are sort of the city hopes\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty sixteen when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett orange and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat than the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned with Democrats and industry isn't as he built himself as an independent voice\nAre you can put any differences aside and come together accomplishment fruits and that's exactly what farmers today I'm not taking over that means nothing reader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he's moved back to the districts are run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWell none of the Republican Jim had adorned in his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington wins in government are so certain Rosen a Trump Jim ...\nI wanted for car with the health and rip out the regulations Obamacare and voters a server oh\nSo Catherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's this on on that well\nHe's been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent dance fee and he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats around not ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really dissed former Minnesota Senator Al Franken\nFor in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior be that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the the accusations we've been hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics\nThe president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that\n[noise] yeah it was it was an interesting point that he made I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that\nAnd this is being set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this you know big discussion about\nSupreme Court and whether I'm is taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and laughed we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place who's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand if presented an opportunity for his party most fascinating but how is the whole\nKavanaugh debate impacting if it is this race or is it just falling along party lines\n[noise] you know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Kavanaugh we support judge Kavanaugh but well it's sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad\nHappens to you Dr Christine Blasey Ford so many years ago we just don't think it was him because he doesn't seem like the type of person who would do that uh they called it a witch hunt they said
