S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms what are the political implications\nOf the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grass down to the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kevin Olival be the two most important things about the mid term he is not only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that there are terrorists uh he's repeated some of that\nAl ... somehow in the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they are about last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's been saying that Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator talked about Mexico sending rapists this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here he is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\n[noise] we'll look it up again a very major tax cuts for middle income people [noise] and if we do that it will be some time just prior I Would say November\nMajor tax guys we're going to be putting in [noise] had are studying very deeply right now around the block a major tax cuts for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their Congress isn't in session as you said they can't vote on this\nBut he said it's going to be major it's going to be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November but people don't buy it broke RMC polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWhat President Trump does you know he used to call this truthful hyperbole and some of his books\nYou know he's talked about liberals rioting for sanctuary cities he talked about how the arms deal to Saudi Arabia he started out saying it would produce forty thousand jobs in America now he says it will produce a million jobs he said Democrats want to give luxury cars to illegal immigrants I mean he's just improvising\nOkay the Democrats do not have a President Trump right now they don't have one leader at the moment but there are a lot of candidates that are running around the country I Want to take a listen just to maybe a closing argument from one of them this is the Democratic governor a candidate in Florida a Andrew Gillum is from a debate with the Republican Ron disanto serious\nSays look public radio\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released their story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha ... so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we hosted the kid the access with the governments can sense it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the gals about what happened to the gym three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may\nWe started filming with them in the government's safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] about six weeks\nSo it was quite will they um with still processing what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when it counts as to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBut he could eat anytime we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so to vote I think the government will say I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see that goes time in captivity because they were held for three years before and it does say she was down and they were releasing well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nThey they um they was free to speak to his of they did give us that diaries discreetly it and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't ... that they\nIf not they would have the what they call those in the full Boko Haram treatment ... uh and in the film what we do is\nThe uh the girls that the book goes who have taken would actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of bills in Nigeria who was taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak\nAnd they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because ah you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who are known in the film is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... for you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're right\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it's say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met had like she\nShe did tell us I Love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have just a pitcher of either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been kidnapping children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engage with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah is functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will run into towns and these fickle them id become a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run to his ... you know they don't just could not they then Ben and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but also safety by numbers on that fled the food aid is going to see how if you want food and he wants to live that's why you have to run\nInto their ... but then a lot of the uh uh loves entirely displaced people end up living within the community so despite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram\nThe numbers displaced people who have come to made a very\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize it's controlled the Nigerian military\nAnd their constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line woods I and you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said there's a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future of the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your from\nI ...\nI'm not in ... and it has changed my life now and I think you need me I'm ... even though right [noise] ... [noise]\n[noise]\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes I think uh\nSo that your book girls who are are in a un that'd be American universities I dropped the American University in Nigeria which is what old age but girls who were released a negotiated full and uh the escaped girls who on the nights that to\nThe kid knocking happens so Jones in Seventy six were kidnapped\nFifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to somebody's various kind of jumped off the back\nAnd half of those have gone straight to this uh University in yoga\nAnd that's why they've beans that last three years and they feel positive about life and so that your book goes who we've only just started they've done it yet at the university I have um we keep in contact with them and they say that while their education is coming on\nAnd I think they realize what a privilege education is so ...\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

the networks new experiment in advertising\nFox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy ...\nMore on Fox afterward I mean what do we have fought for skin they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can recap they live for this Sunday Edition sponsored by Google visuals race\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd they're also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night these nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jazz pause what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which being sued traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty seconds units which are actually a second you just got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it and\nIt's also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new content is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh\nBasically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertises like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around\nIt allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers and he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own source that are buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority of the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYes so you don't let her out you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you picked our car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to a Tesla to a Porsche people share all sorts of ...\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's throw a which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a mass of opportunity this disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\nSome of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by seven\nPeople really eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nYour so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their use your basement so\nHence why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set out for a solution to the marketplace\nSo you believe people really do want to live without a car\nI think if you offered them mobility Ivan equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's obsolete true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like Toyota an over so it was continue investing us partnerships and expanding our or Russia or partners\nWell speaking of labor and Toyota neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one than sort of very aware of in fact it was a ton of cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if your car could drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and it's maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opened a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace like get around checking people or owners\nOf vehicles with um you know companies and individuals need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of the occult are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then it would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in a world where for fifty years out in the ... sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those cars might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network function is required to sort of operate those vehicles and\nVery close to even what we do today right we help owners share cars efficiently in you know urban centers across the United states and we work with partners you know who helped service those cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate the network and so we feed the opportunity there's something that's pretty large\n\nFunding for here and now comes from network readers of that law to simulate somewhere accelerating the pace

Democratic congressman from California\nGerman welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nThink condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region a and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia and Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old\nCrown prince a has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a you know some kind of a adult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could Manny ... humanitarian catastrophe that we currently she and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot ah to to do this is\nA really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now and and hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this was going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has\nAnd ah I'm not against either agenda um but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior or in order to make sure that agenda continues a I think we can do both\nAnd that is NBS the reason we have that agenda I don't think so I think Saudi Arabia is the reason we have that agenda and\nAt four hundred hope street ... dot com\nAppointments a free one meow\nFunding for here and now

Senator Bob Menendez an end as is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this race is a reporter with WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nA German so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in a mist trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign event he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\nA it's been a struggle for him I think it would be fair to say she has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and ... and has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with imminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nGoing over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting\nWith the Jersey of every location in our state they want\nYou know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nDespite all of that are there been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here's Sen Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so what about you can says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he and he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate by\n... you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not twice with three times for drugs that those cancer patients critically need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him [noise]\nWell it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug reveling that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up ... and has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice he he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he he went to the the Republican convention so\nYou know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's ... he's the first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with ... ethics issues\nYeah you would think Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people but so do Menendez is ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know you get tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and\nThey're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election [noise]\nUm you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty\nPretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue and you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey often\nDoes elect a Republican and and and a reelection them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank well beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party and\nThat is Joe Hernandez of W H where I was talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it\nWill know now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with the federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... y rocket members just W a democracy and K. U. W. reports progress is for\nThe Washington state patrol the state's police agency estimates there are between eight thousand and ten thousand rape kits that haven't been tested\nEvery one of those represents a survivor who's Weiss wasn't hurt who didn't have justice and also potentially very dangerous offender still on the streets\nThat state representative Tina or wall a few years ago she sponsored a bill that passed the legislature it required that every kid be tested they didn't solve the problem now there is a bottleneck at the state crime lab\nRecently in Seattle and the city of Tom water to pieces emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat in the testing cue\nThat's increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process them more quickly this year Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog around fourteen thousand rape kit [noise]\nAt the crime lab in rural central Ohio the rooms are set up like well equipped high school chemistry labs along narrow Cora doors\nSo this again this is the biology lab during the laboratory supervisor Christian flavor stands in front of the rooms glass window on the other side a scientist is testing a rape case you can see the white box that's close to the window so with the paper bags\nRape kits are smaller than a shoe box\nThey're filled with materials and Q tip like swabs of body fluids collected by a nurse after a rape\nAt this lab robots help test those samples for DNA these are robots they have names like a vi Ninety seven hundred and tea can the robots do three times the work of one scientist their key to the labs efficiency\nSo is another word you might be unfamiliar with ties and sleeper explains that they basically\nDid a hack us on using a Japanese productivity philosophy called ... rape kit testing follow something like an assembly line and the idea was to examine each step to make it more efficient sleeper says it worked\nIt used to be that it could take a scientist a day an entire day to work a rape kit um and now it can take an hour two hours for them to open it do minimal screening take their notes and cut the samples into tubes and then move it along to the next step\nThe Ohio labs were essential and providing evidence from many sexual assault cases testing the kids helped uncover three hundred serial rapists and solve over one thousand crimes including the case of lives Garcia\nGarcia was raped at home in Cleveland in two thousand and four\nI was looking in the mirror I was like oh I did a really good job with my here this morning then I noticed that the door was opening so that's when I turned my attention to the door\nA stranger in a ski mask walked in choked her and raped her over a decade later that man is now in prison for life without parole DNA testing help to link him to the rates of Twenty one women Garcia says getting justice helped her\nShelves do nothing for us for us women in the process of our healing we have to know whether the assailant has caught we have to get our chance in court to face some\nRape kits in Ohio are tested and out the door in less than a month but in Washington state it can take around a year and a half to test one rape kit\nGene Johnston is a crime lab manager with the Washington state patrol\nShe says the labs are in a tough spot there's just an increase in the demand for service so it's it's hard to keep pace with that after the state law passed in twenty Fifteen requiring DNA testing on all rape cats Washington made some changes\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity\nWhen what really shape sound a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they well in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nSmartphone now and it it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to and your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing the the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations zero ... is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with where they're asked about\nUm their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities to hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\n[noise] we mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped the generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in our conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors are very interested in\nPhysical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think as well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing is another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say they're interested in government or social issues\nOr politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago why do you think so um well I think because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to see on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix than you know I think some ... I saw them some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had some many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart ... I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nSo absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access\nUm during their quick thinkers on this actually data showing the IQ has has gone up over the generations so I think ... is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older and and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\n[noise] well I think we do need to be aware on just how\nSevere um that mental health crisis has right now among teens and young adults\nSo there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be\nThat we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression and self harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of that causes behind that and then more funding and awareness for treatment\nThat gene ... who is professor of psychology at San Diego State University and author of I Gen gene thank you thank you", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Providence", "day": "22"}
