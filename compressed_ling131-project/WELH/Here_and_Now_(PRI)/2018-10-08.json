she says she hasn't seen as social movement this powerful since the Tiananmen Square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ...\nLately assessed thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first to focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed and twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses\nBut before they even carried out their plan the police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rats\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is it done well well um well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because on the authorities were kind of feeling around for something that charging them with and and and the end it was something\nI can too disturbing the social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people and the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because um all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film this five\nWell I mean a a among the founding of five quite a few of them um had\nUm for example the nights herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father\nI'm from a very early age and her uncle um some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally being um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back one\nOf the of some of his father when mom for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree you know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous outage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal\nWithout ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either and the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and the and and the propaganda the rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do\nOn and so even today you seeds legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who've been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThat dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly on there what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the ...\nReturn to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother um all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um said that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing a very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories on there is a work with all the censorship going on China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship which has become incredibly sophisticated\nThat these women are stairs so imaginative that they find ways of circulating their message and getting around the censorship censorship I mean just to give one example there was one activist who I'm Wendy hash tag me too as being very heavily censored\nThis one young woman came up with the idea of using him oh jeez for rice and Bonnie which which is me tool in Chinese which sounds like me too\nAnd so that was one way or that they were able to gain a get around the censorship for a while um another on the government called him red light but then they're continually playing this game of cat and mouse and coming up with new ways to get around the censorship because they have done this without the Internet [noise]\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the

them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior named ... he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah fairs on as a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school if you did I I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help\nHe is of mixed heritage his dad his Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um vision is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in the school [noise]\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues since right right and he I mean you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop the image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was the best chance face right All right yeah sort of shocked on yeah and I had sent it anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who sent it his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure\nOut how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK other students\nSort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to\nBe a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right\n[laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do you have to deal with it I sort of did this thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared I\nDidn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not and not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking\nNot invasive questions but sort of like they'd never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well with what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think\nMost people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window versus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of\nA little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone\nSo how does ... in the book realize that understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of ... and for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal\nMonologue you can tell that he is really hurting and I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know set for yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to she had him have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or\nYou know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't right like he he does your first and you don't want to be the ... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved\nBut I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that\nOr get over it maybe after the book finishes but for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time\n... ... what do you what's the pay for you is it just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but I it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional and very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people last\nIf you were I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice\nIn prejudiced times and how can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ... thank you thank you so much appreciate it Sarah fires on the book is called here to stay to read an excerpt go to here and now dot org\nI'm\n\nToday the ...

predictions um but a lot of scary predictors are made in a lot of climate studies by different sources what makes this one different and how do you gauge um the the importance of these

you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen\nComplicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east at the moment the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by a who's the to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is that a Saudi led coalition with us support also UK other European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemeni control of the capital Sana'a on up Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids there'll be led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted\nThe front lines uh Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic goes through the ... data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of aid and commercial traffic is getting through\nI'm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between the who the is on the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who the Z\nBut other than the other side from the Saudis the lesson the u._k.\nExactly so immediately you have a theological splits Sunni Shia you also have a split of in trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is that this is a humanitarian catastrophe or the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving\nTo death but at the same time there was a political emergency too\nBecause the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists of al ... and I says and it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian meltdown but political melt down I mean what does that mean it means that\nThe humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there was a few to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at gas stations on the road you've got teachers and doctors and nurses are not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid\nAs a country which can't sustain itself or the moment is being ravaged by war that is not to the benefit of any of the sides are waging it was in fact being exploited by extremists and I think that the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S in the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no snow ones benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire\nWent into whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSettled on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. the U. S. and the others want what's their goal\nThat goal is first of all to roll back who the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand and four team or two and a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no question about who sees\nHave launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed a on the other side\nShould say that the U.S secretary of state make them pay as his the coalition is taking steps to minimize\nCause I met a Yemeni who told me about missiles that had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of school children more than forty of them killed in August is that just stay in the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation but everything is being done to protect civilians why we know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not wanting to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority\nI I'm not costing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being\nA protected them to come up to the war has breached the basically the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the who decided independent un inquiries\nHave produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a a crisis that now I came away saying that the willingness to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed but the pet needs to be picked up because there is not a current debate to replace the failed U.N Security council resolution twenty Fifteen was something that is actually a roof map to peace rather than the cop lunch for\nIf we take the issue of 'em are refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world\nThat you've moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year\nHow does that affect your work who\nJust for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh historically\nFor the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture orphan children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader and was called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees are you at the U. S. actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's a legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce by Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translators and things\nThat are being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who'd calm now started a new life to work in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up being targeted because of that support the u._s. then not being allowed allowed in\nEither so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the U.S\nGovernment and the great danger is it a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees contribute more to the American economy than they take out in a welfare payments approving program is being strangled and this year um with\nStory pillow and the number of refugees allowed and only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year the ended on September the ... the Trump Administration has ... into the U.S at the Trump Administration is such a feeling of such a thousand for this fiscal year which started on October\n... the first and so what we see is not just the effect on individual lives of those who would have come here there's also the fact that countries around the world is seeing the U.S doesn't have that back let me give you an example Jordan the second closest ally the United states in the middle east it's dealing with six hundred and fifty thousand registered refugees from Syria\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

remains one of the art world's most confounding mysteries\nA half billion dollars worth of art were stolen from the Isabella steward Gardner Museum in Nineteen Ninety there was Thirteen pieces in all including works by Rembrandt de Gaulle Vermeer and then a ...\nStolen art has been recovered WB you are in the Boston Globe of launched a podcast called last seen to investigate how and why that's the case you were reporters jak were lethal in totally [noise]\nIn the early hours of march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety the city of Boston was still celebrating saint Patrick's Day hangovers would be widespread come daybreak so would news at the city's most unusual museum had been the victim of a daring overnight robbery [noise]\nThey didn't take off and then here's what's happening at priceless collection of artwork was stolen early this morning from Boston Isabella Gardner Museum\nThere was one I Am Saturday the two men posing as uniformed policeman ... security guard's here like me to be investigating a disturbance\nInitial estimates put the value of the cell and work that it will be two hundred million dollars ... million dollar eighty seven year old Gardner Museum is considered one of the finest small art in his hands in the country\nOfficials say the museums elaborate surveillance system made no difference\nTo me and my facial today said it was the largest heart high in history\nDespite the confidence of museum officials that the prejudice artworks will be recovered experts say they could disappear for years perhaps forever [noise] read well as\nTV for eyewitness news\nThe thieves who pulled off the greatest art heist in history had a pretty simple plan they dressed up and cop uniforms and rang the bell there was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere have been a keg party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum\nThat guard was ...\nThey came in and they turn so she's like I say that they had had ... it looked like out so it does the rest of the way\nThe script in any way Cabot talked about that night at an Indian restaurant in two thousand Thirteen\nThe first question was as anybody else who I said my partner okay yeah\nThis is the first time that former guard the one who was on duty that night we've had that has ever spoken publicly about his experience\nWondering if they might just come up behind my head with a gun with the silence or and just you know do it real quickly\nIt was terrifying night into all these years later he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he's still place makes a living at it mostly in house bands on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a master's in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing to supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you knows I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit and don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nNighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring\nI was always happy to say yes to filling in\nRandy doesn't recall any special training or specific instructions for the night shift beyond\nThe requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on all the florists during his round\nHe did that by slicing a magnetic strap he wasn't originally on the schedule to work the night after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reported they called in sick edited told him about the carriage alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to a ... at the watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that connection over this might have something to do with that alarm that went off\nOne of the uniformed man said he recognized and asked to see his id\nHe said yeah I Do know you there's a warrant out for your arrest and he told Rick to stand against the wall or put his arms up he does the pat down he puts the cops on\nAnd on just standing there with my job and going wow you know what what's going on what the written due to see really into some kind of trouble and it's still never occurred to me that they were anything but policemen\nBy stepping out and away from the desk recap it's also stepped away from the still means signaling traveled to the outside world to museums panic button\nNo sooner with Abbott against the wall and handcuffed than Randy was to\nBuy kept asking him over and over why are we being arrested why are we being arrested and he wouldn't answer slowed cups or on my hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape and he says this is a robbery and so then everything was fine like crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly it made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the law was going to your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise] um but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them saying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief\nAnd I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they\nThere's nothing here in this museum that is worth my life\nThe thieves plan duct tape around Mandy an avid had from tend to scout across their eyes and across their mouths was only a split so they could breed than stare stare the robbers led the guards you couldn't see a thing down to the basement\nOne of the the use and other parents handcuffed you attach Randy you would drain pipe under a limestone sink near a boiler\nRandy recall that that the let's pick ... that you and weirdly courteous\nThe guy who kept me he was making sure that they weren't too tight on my wrist and he adjusted that several times and he said I you're going to be here for a long time so I don't want the ... these to be too tight\nSo he was real column and real nice about it and he also several times said sorry to have to do this\nRandy just one of the guy to get away from him to go do what he had come to do to get out of there were you panicking\nUm it was scary and I remember feeling like I needed to prepare myself for deaf if that if it ended up coming to that what does that mean preparing yourself for death while I was running music through my head a lot just feeling\nIt's all in history but I'm\nJust felt like I needed to be mentally\nIs there a particular piece of music that you renting in mind [noise]\nDefinitely I remember one of the pieces [noise]\nThe Mozart requiem\n\nIt didn't occur to me later that has to do with that has to do with the people [noise]\nRandy spent the next eight hours shackled on the basement floor terrified the entire time that the thieves would return to kill him\nReporters jak were legal in ... in an excerpt from last seen a new podcast from the
