Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThis this year and now the midterms are three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predictions tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology and in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future\nSo how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of production Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's going to happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment\nAnd what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see is a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to a race that uncertain and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nWhen the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future our weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where we've at it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasters they always get things wrong they exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters and one of the reasons why they're so good\nAnd so many other domains is it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at\nThe big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else um they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate they are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen and once you think you know what's going to happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make it accurate\nForecasts are made it's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting and entertaining\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nAnd one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to ... for others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to get me to straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked to say that the Nineteen seventies where the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bombed by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise]\nUm well it reminds me of Y. two K. right that we all thought that general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this\nIf I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about or forecast all forecasts are old news but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right\nThen they will be introduced as the person who got it right and we all have to listen to this person because they tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often it's heads I win tails you forget we had a bat right\nWell you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I said it was going to happen [laughter] yep\nAnd you know look it's a there's an old saying about the mutual funds you know you start\nFive hundred mutual funds and you just bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big and then you hold up your one or two that hit big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecast very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat stand gardener who is author of the book future babble and co author of super forecasting the art and science of production dance thank you so much for joining us thank you and let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise at here now dot org\nNow to the environmental fall out from one of the most destructive fires in California history in late July the Carr Fire swept through parts of the city of reading and the surrounding area today residents are faced with burning hillsides burned hillsides and more than a thousand homes sites contaminated with toxic ash\nLiam Moriarty from Jefferson public radio reports\n[noise] I'm just off keswick dam road on the western edge of renting the Carr Fire blasted through this neighborhood on the evening of July twenty six\nCrew in white hazmat suits and respirators as methodically sifting through the ash and rubble five in Rodriguez the California Department of toxic substances control says this is phase one of the clean up\nThat entails screening the properties that have been devastated by the fire and looking at household hazardous waste that needs to be removed to allow for the ash and debris to go off in the future time Rodriguez\nSays the typical American home contains a whole range of products that can cause toxic contamination after a fire\nYou for press got cylinders but looking for batteries looking for any paints any solving any pesticides herbicides\nHazmat workers are marking what they find with spray paint to signal the removal crews white paint for propane tanks and other standard hazardous waste ... which requires its own special removal techniques\nOnce phase one is complete crews will collect the ash and rubble including the building's foundation and hold it all off to a hazardous waste facility the danger of toxic gas blowing across the landscape gives this job a sense of urgency but there are other post fire threat says well\nWe're on the back deck of my house Daniel Whitley a standing behind his home in the lake reading states neighborhood were many homes were damaged or destroyed Whitley was nearly one of them\nWere looking at the remnants of the Carr Fire that came a pair of sleep close to the back of the house\nAs he points to the burned hillside right out is back door he talks about his plans to head off the erosion that winter rains are likely to cause I'll put in some straw bottles those long stalled filled\nFlexible things and then I'm going to plant some I'm pretty bunch grasses up their\nWhitley says if he can get the grasses established before winter he thinks he can avoid potential mudslides drew co says that in some of readings burned over hillside neighborhoods so called debris flows could well be a danger\nShe can have essentially a large mass of rock and mud and water moving down and can wipe out a house\nCall was with Cal fire's watershed emergency response team the group of hydrologist a soil scientist and other experts uses sophisticated digital map and tools and onsite observation to identify populated areas at risk for landslides another post fire hazards to safety and property\nShe says the size of the Carr Fire and the geological conditions in reading means the threats here aren't as dire as after last year's massive Thomas Fire in Southern California\nWe don't have large concentrations of populations just downstream of watersheds that can really respond in a high magnitude waited storms falling wildfire we don't have a modest you don't hear\nMuch to see though on the coast just north of Los Angeles was hit with monster mudslides last January when heavy rains fail on burned over hillsides nearly two dozen people died but risks to

Trump said he spoke with the king of Saudi Arabia\nSticking firmly denied any knowledge of it [noise] you didn't really know if he don't want to get by but it sounded to me like you do sort of the world knows\nPresident Trump also said he's sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia let's kick off the week ahead in politics with NPR lead political editor demand ... now had a medical\n... are drawing or afternoon [laughter]\nLet's start with a missing Saudi journalist the president picking up on a theory that your colleague NPR's Jackie Northam told us is popular in Saudi Arabia this was roped killers\nBut in a consulate you know even Republican lawmakers want punishment that the president seems unwilling to carry out in blocking an arms deal with what do you what's your sense of what's going to happen here\nWell it certainly complicated geopolitically for this president he seems to have revealed himself pretty plainly as somebody who wants to talk about you know specific transactions and it's very transactional person this is the way he was with his real estate deals and the thing that kept coming up for President Trump\nWas the fact last night on sixty minutes that\nHe said look they we get billions of dollars in a you know these weapons sales and he doesn't want to hurt jobs when it comes to race yawn or any of the other uh arms makers\nWell and and as others have said these aren't really commitments for sales are more like promissory notes you know they they may not have an anyway but and some of the most as did happen under the Obama administration but you mentioned the sixty\nMinutes interview he was also asked about that die report from the inter governmental agencies are claiming that a climate change is real and time is running out to do something about it\nThe president said he's not denying that climate change exists but that it could change back and then people say that storms or as we just saw it with hurricane Michael were worse years ago let's listen to this conversation with Leslie stall\nThey say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael says that they say when they say that India but what about scientists who say it's worse than ever are you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda the medical\nWorld climate change is real uh that's the thing that we had to end it right [laughter] ah but this is a president who again is very transactional he's not somebody who's very interested in the long view or the science he's interested in making sure that the economy stays where it is so that it benefits him\nPolitically and I think again that's what we continue to see and continue to talk about he's not somebody with a vision\nFor the globe or as much as he is somebody who's trying to win the next battle and move on and it's something that he talked about even with the Brett Kavanaugh fight that they won and that's why he went and talked about Christine Blasey Ford the way he did a because it was about winning and now he's moved on from that are going through our our\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and college fine where consulting work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college find dot com\n\nIt's here and now and now look at some of the latest technology for the blind and the vision impaired with our friend and go to guy Brian chosen director of technology at the ... Center for the blind\nAnd rainy and all sorts of things spread out here in the studio and we're making a video so people can see this for their loved ones were posted it here now dot org but what would you like to start\nI'm going to start with the simplest of technologies one that has a lot of impact on blind are visually impaired people\nAnd that is our ability to pick the right medicine at the right time you got to medicine on medicine bottles year and attached to its side is a little digital recorder now there's kind of comical a recording on here\n[noise] [laughter]\nWow what a weight thing\nInstead of having to put rubber bands on to indicate whether or not this was a once a day or twice a day or three times a day mad I can rely on this kind of labeling\nThat is amazing I'm a first of all who knew that Abraham Lincoln had it for ... yeah\nYeah for Xanax now is this is one example of two or three different companies out there\nAre raising up in the pattern of braille characters now\nA couple of years ago I was showing your refrigerator will braille display and you were astounded at the price of three thousand four thousand dollars this one now costs five hundred oh wow so braille is becoming more affordable than it's ever been before\nAnd now I'm going to turn to magnification ... the vast majority are blind are visually impaired people have usable vision\nSo out of those who are legally blind about eight out of ten have some useful vision so we use closed circuit TV devices I'm going to turn this one on ...\nLooks like a very small TV\nYou know come on yet\nIt gives me controls to show things and magnification to increase the magnification decrease it changed the polarity of things so my view things better white on black than black on white then fine I can switch that can also take a picture with it\nOr at a distance bring it closer to my face and be able to control that magnification as well and if you do have a large TV in your living room you can attach this to that and use it screen but the device that's on your\nCamera this on your device and really enlarging image so grandparents ... with low vision can see pictures of their grandkids are so this makes it very portable for them to do that when it's like\nWe know you have to catch the bus that's an application that it can help you find bus stops or learn a rival departure times blind square that a GPS application just like foursquare but I Want to see the device it helps you know the color of your clothing\n[laughter] so the color identifier that are brought to show your last time costs three hundred and fifty dollars and this one is twenty six wow and this is maybe a temp the side so that one yeah take a call key fob exactly I'm going to hold it against my time\n[noise] like orange that say that dark red states [noise] got me [noise] now I'm pointing it at my pants and they say [noise]\nVery dark brown that's lying I'm wearing a looking black pants a gray and [noise] yeah that\nTells me guess what the batteries dying [laughter] when is it that far off\nWow so I'm now match my own pans with shirts with ties in my household something that I always had to rely on somebody else to do in the past I Want to see the classes that get help with so we're going to take off my regular\nDesigners shades here mhm and put on a pair of glasses but they have a camera mounted just above the no no way\nSo I'm now going to take a phone it's specifically a over rice and phone that has only one purpose and that's to do what I'm about to do with it for for I Am I ready for service and now if I double tap on the home button on this phone it's calling in Iran agent\nActing hardy [noise]\nHey Cody Brian here I'm I'm doing a demonstration of Iraq for public radio Hi Cody and across the way here is my interview were and how can you do me a favor describe the pretty lady [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] wow\nHow'd you do did pretty well ... ... can I just have to question what kinds of situations do you usually deal with like just if you can give us a couple of examples I'm sure people get in real trouble and need your help\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIs in the public's radio\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

hundred nine four seven auto\nIt's here now back to President Trump's comments last night on sixty minutes continuing to question the importance of addressing climate change\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um I don't want to give trillions and trillions of ...\nJobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage well others are pushing forward in fact they're fighting there saying that fighting climate change can be job producing and we're running out of time according to last week's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change there's just about a decade left\nTo take on President action to reduce to reduce the extreme impacts of climate change\nTheir report recommends reducing current emission is being released into the atmosphere but also capturing the carbon dioxide that's already out there what's known as negative and missions so let's take a look with Gregory ... a professor of public affairs and environmental studies at the last ... school of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison\nProfessor technologies will be needed to do this but one of the easiest way the carbon dioxide out of the plants right because they just suck it out\n[noise] yeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take ... to ... out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of Syria to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing it all of these\nUh schemes to remove CEO to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one with planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with and if it's if that's something else is growing food\nUm that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future\nAnd if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food and using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects and things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because of scale has to be so large\nWilling also we know that dead trees only store carbon for so much for so long I'm it may not be long enough\nYeah there was a permanent issue with uh storing CEO too and I'm In trees that I'm is not such an issue of your stories underground for example okay\nSo let's move on to some of the other ideas carbon capture storage what are some of the ideas there\nSo the idea with carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground so that's a way to avoid CEO to going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions there is a way you can actually remove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme by again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy you takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops than you burn the crops and the power plant and instead of putting that Syria to back into the atmosphere you're gonna do the same thing compress it and stored underground and\nThat has the potential to remove a billions of tons of ... too\nAnd in this case stored underground where it tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to do with it has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that you need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for\nCrops that we're going to use the stores here too and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could\nA Korean food security issues which is something we want to avoid what about\n... and by the way we just said Steven Pinker is a terrific and provocative new book a night and it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on a technologies that we aren't you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along but what about just sucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well\nAnd you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or space craft where you need to remove the CEO to the humans are generating just by breathing and so the idea is could we do that at an industrial scale and capture CEO to this in the air capture that's due to compress it and then store underground\nThat is appealing one of the most appealing aspects of that is it doesn't have this large land impact\nThat almost every other one of the schemes has the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive thing so\nSomething like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes\nCrime or actually a switch to start up and they say the conflict between six hundred and eight hundred for metric kinda CEO to captured 'em there's another company in Canada and protect closer to two hundred fifty per metric time but it gets expensive\nThat's expensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to over the whole world now I think a number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in Sweden and then you got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about those technologies is the concepts come down so as you say climb works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of CEO to\nTheir next plant plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of CEO to there's another company called carbon engineering and Canada has things that can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat\nThat uh is doing its first demonstration in Alabama this year and they think that'll be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so this idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it\nIt seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built\nWithout severe problems and with costs it seemed to be starting to come down so there is a potential to really get the cost down to make it affordable and not have the land use impacts one of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of C. O. two by mid century\nUm and so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon right now so there's three companies we've mentioned that's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I\nI think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't fit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for direct heir captures how you scale up from three companies\nDoing on the order of five or six plants to something like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\n[laughter] ... well are you getting the investors excited about that\nThat that may be the future but look again Steven Pinker writes that the more speculative and this kind of thinking includes plans to disperse pulverized rock it takes up CEO tuition weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve or C. O. two in the water\nFertilize the ocean with iron to accelerate flown since it's just like plankton and again ... out of the atmosphere in different ways where do you say though\nTo however Todd I'm a fellow of seeing things at MIT who says in the fact that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing a sea of two nations if people start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes called uh\nIf you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case it means you won't produce some missions uh enough\nI I actually think we're not we don't really have the the luxury of dismissing this negative emotions technology is something that um will just take away our incentives I mean it's kind of like you know an insurance policy for a house insurance or fire insurance or something like that where\nYeah maybe there is a sense in which if you have the insurance there'll be less careful about fires in your house but on the other hand most people still want to have a insurance because it's it's worth it to them and it's worth it to society and I think that's kind of the way we have to\nHave to look at it I think the other thing is you know we're\nWe're not reducing emissions enough already even without talking about negative admissions so I think\nTo say that the reason we're not reducing emissions us because we've got this a breakthrough technology that we can use in the future I don't think that's um that's really what's what's limiting us and I don't think it'll be enough just to have the negative in Michigan so we really need both we need to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Providence", "day": "15"}
