I'm Peter O'Dowd this this year and now big news today at the White House Nikki Haley and now she is resigning as ambassador to the United nations at the end of the year she and President Trump made the announcement in the oval office thinking\nThe United nations has been very special she's done an incredible job she is a fantastic person very importantly that feel so is somebody that gets it\nNPR's Scott Horsley joins us now he's got this felt like something of a surprise to quite a few people would've Haley say about why she was ...\nI think it surprised a lot of people both uh here in the U.S and in the international community she didn't really offer an explanation for the timing except to say she she needs a break after six years of South Carolina governor and the last nearly two as UN ambassador\nOr she is going to stay on 'til the end of the year she said a a ... and a ... that given that the timing on this Tuesday Morning is a is a little little interesting I'm thinking back to the twenty sixteen\nThat of the president's they've also disagree to time since she's joined his camera over the past two years but if you read their body language today in the oval office listen to what they were saying um they were very cordial how's that relationship of all over the past couple\nOf years she has been a loyal soldier in the Trump Administration and in this case loyalty might sometimes mean telling the president things he doesn't want to hear areas where she disagrees with him\nWhen that anonymous op ed came out in the New York times the number of weeks ago from a administration insider Haley was critical of that approach and said when she has\nA criticism she takes it directly to the president she doesn't necessarily air it out in public\nAnd that idea of keeping dirty laundry in the background extends to their their photo off in the oval office today\nLet's here's more from this morning Haley talking about some of the Trump administration's accomplishments\nWon't get half of the United states on foreign policy now the United states it\nI said that if we say we're going to do something we follow when that whether it was it the chemical weapons is whether we sang in our country has to pay their share Scott\nWhat is Nikki Haley's record as UN ambassador and how much credit does she get ... for what we just heard\nWell actually we should say the international uh surveys by the Pew Research center suggested a attitudes in most countries towards the United states and the president have fallen rather sharply since Trump took office\nAlthough it is certainly true that the president has demonstrated if he says he's gonna blow something up he does whether it's a airstrip in Syria or the Iran nuclear deal\nOr you have definitely seeing the u._s. uh\nUh pushing forward with the president's America First agenda and Haley has been a an effective and the president today said glamorous advocate that agenda\nOr you can see it in the way the U.S a has a uh\nTaken a a more aggressive posture towards Israel I'm moving the U.S embassy there for example to Jerusalem\nAnd Nikki Haley famously criticize those who criticize that move saying the U.S would would take names most notably of course the U.S has pulled out of the Paris climate accord we we saw the report this week from the un climate agency saying that's a a desperate need and us leadership is a missing in action they're\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

here and now the twenty twenty cents is is at the center of a legal battle the Trump Administration wants to include the question on his about whether the resident answering the census is a U.S citizen\nOpponents say that's unconstitutional and they want commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to answer questions about it under oath\nInternal documents show the secretary Ross pushed for the question even though he told Congress that the Justice Department had asked for it the White House wants to stop Ross from having to testify today a panel of judges are reviewing that request NPR national correspondent ... is following this story he joins us now Hansi\nHi Lisa you have a new read thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place\n[noise] all these documents were part released in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key document is an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as our secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty cents is and it it he says that he initially\nThought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks\nIs this person a citizen of the United states it's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration give for why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least what is the thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department's a which is representing a secretary Wilbur Ross into trouble ministries in these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the children ministry ... said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted responses from a citizenship question to better and for section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially took her to make sure it's\nThat the ... the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the tradition says that data is not enough ah is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include\nA communication between a Kris Kobach the currents are Republican gubernatorial candidates as well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross addict citizenship question and his concern\nWas that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted\nIn census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency or the Twenty one twenty census is going to be the first\nTo be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what does a massive undertaking\nWell the uh the census bureau's really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross added will stay or will it go and where you probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline but the Census Bureau is facing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but cheaper will play important part for live households that may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd so this is a really big question right now that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve\nA from the Census Bureau perspective another big question bull they the Census Bureau being able to hire enough workers to collective uh information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... long thanks a lot\nYou're welcome the anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy made headlines over the weekend by regain his own artwork to self destruct\nHis painting of a little girl letting go of a heart shaped balloon began to shred itself just after it was sold for nearly one point four million dollars at southern ... in London this latest stunt has the art world ... and many more people wondering once again who is Banksy\nSophia ... has been exploring that question for the sun in London I said\nHey [laughter] and first your thoughts when you saw that painting slide down the picture frame in shreds at the auction\nOh my goodness isn't ... hot stuffing maintenance and the first question was why is it happening and and the second was how how is it happening because obviously at a time Nate when me that that was shredded built into defame\nBecame I was in shock and horror not just in that option ... everyone's eyes on that paints a at a time\nAnd for some people listening that was their first introduction to Banksy so tell us what we know about him because he's a a man we think who is famous for being mysterious\nHe ... he famously being mysterious and his name is Scott ... of the U.S wealth and he's a basic he he's an enormous English ... S T the streets and graffiti artists that he kind of gets named the political artist as well and you kind of shape when they see in the nineties and\nAnd he's black reaching any highlights did a lot of corruption and inequality and society but he did it in a very humorous way now to David Hume is slightly less and you take the most serious pain in his walk and I say he's never been on mosques that there are\nHundreds of theories as to who he could be and and we still\nWhen the painting the shredded well so let's talk about some of the theories then what are you know 'cause there are people who who think they've seen him at work doing one of ... installations on a wall somewhere or in what you know we don't know who he is so um what are some of the theories about about who this ... this mysterious or this might be\nThey have ranged from him being a painter and decorate to to another graffiti artist named king ... and people say he's Damian Hess people even say that\nYou know banks he may well be a woman and there's another theory that he's and not just one person he is a collection of artists [laughter] it's just because he's such a a an icon of mystery the the theories range from\nWhat could potentially be the tree to something very outrageous and I think there was a bond that they said he was the from mine if the bonds\nAnd because every time that bond performed in the late ... see the ... pop and the guy had to come out and say um it's definitely not me I have a creative bone in my ...\n... what do you think he was trying to say bye shredding up painting in my opinion\nAnd I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the first time his what has gone up for sale and and it's something that has been done without his consent\nThis time I had to see I I this is just my personal opinion on the opinion that certain people I ... that the painting and the shredding if the painting was away at him saying my\nWife is not for one pass and it's everybody and because this painting it shut it off to the hammer wet and\nIt was a way of him saying they swap doesn't belong to anybody he he never paints he never does his graffiti odds in a place that can belong to one pass and he does in public space that he does and in places where it would be very difficult to remove them or for anybody to claim that that all black\nAnd I think not what he did he wants his message and he wants his what to be for everybody rather than one passes take initiatives at other theories I've had a he wants his what to have a great ...\nOf the times I've had that he wants his wife to be priceless that could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide Schroeder inside a picture frame without anyone noticing the auction house was in on this\n... and because he has ... Instagram Shea how he went about building the framed himself and installing the shredder inside um I think as he was the end you pass in on that um\nIt could it could very well it's been someone's inside the base in on it but maybe a friend who may be another another graffiti artist he maybe he was walking that but I didn't I didn't have any bikini than it was it was tea bakes anybody to have 'em anticipation\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and carbon night offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses including automatic back up for servers and computers high as ... ability and disaster recovery solutions and automated data migration learn more at ... dot com\nAnd Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance through the Geico insurance agency\nAdditional information can be found at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven\nAuto\nIt's here and now in Afghanistan today a suicide bomber killed a candidate running in this month's parliamentary election it's the latest in a series of attacks that have been carried out by the Taliban or ISIS fighters in the country this year this week marks Seventeen years since the U.S launched the war in Afghanistan less than a month after the nine eleven attacks\nPresident George W.

K. bench pass it we are all here yes S. Justin Paul hello there in Lansing hello\nThen I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIs not directly based on something that happened to my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim they were closer with him than they actually were ah myself included\nAnd I was struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of\nPublic we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets up every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself gear Evan Hansen your kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your Evan Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansen kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also that the people around him are ... by the story as well I Know he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken him by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\n[noise] well\n[laughter] I'm not [laughter]\nHow you were able to put those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nYou know it's true um it's one that we talked a lot about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments when the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nYeah it is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we want to distribute different experience from the musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge\nTo live on its own now any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially Evan Hansen really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line um and Evan ... first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty but by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before where I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to have and and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you add that I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know I'm just the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't want to give anything away but I have to say we actually find out is ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about ... or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ... I understand that why you did they did what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical you fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan and Conor what might happen\nThis is just and you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing a novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listened to the cast album or read or watch the clip on line is\nStories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\nIt is a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents about humanizing them and ultimately it's really about how we relate to our family members how we hide ugly truth about our so\nVisitors Rhode Island public radio\n\nFunding for here and now

those of humanitarian aid workers\nAnd food and health care and temporary shelter aid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program has drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem\nThe ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Phillip ... is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidences but continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were eager that people take care of their team take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult in desperate\nSays you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't right\nThat's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nDo you think this is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that we're going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores if Greece a pretty high margin is quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHave grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the fall it's me or not they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they married someone from outside Greece these ... workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a a shared a humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have no need for quite some time\nCan you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states to get back to the origins of all my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back\nAnd offer what our cat we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks in so long ago and from above the work that we do um the recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way has been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilip can tell us thank you actually show\nThat's Dr Phil ... who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for
