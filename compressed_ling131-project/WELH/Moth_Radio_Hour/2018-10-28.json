southern Washington state's feeling ill\nAre driven down from Seattle where I live now a friend of mine was was visiting Portland, Oregon and uh so I've driven down to to see him\nUm [noise] but I also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know and uh I saw those cars you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was in a casino\nAnd uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise]\nAnd I was also concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play a blackjack for a living I was a card counter um which is called counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning of the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse and so I Am sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me as adults a hand he gets a twenty as his hand a but it's not an ordinary twenty it's made up of two cranes apart screen of hearts on top of another queen of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand at the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right\nNow I used to go carts for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of\nFriends mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous and sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it a new stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your breast pocket of your shirt or a jacket and you walk out with it and you feel\nPhysically enhanced

customers of the casino people who work there weren't going around and everybody there and knew exactly what I had just one\nAnd it seemed me at the cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the ... [noise]\nAnd ah briskly across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you turn to ensure I wasn't being followed and then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but at the Pacific northwest so\nExpanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team in the sense of\nParanoia averaging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining the headlights of distance\nTrying to into it if any of the cars back to their look menacing and I kept asking myself again and again is everything going to be All right\nThank you\nJosh beyond the actual rich\nA rock is unfairly dark memoir I think life as a professional card counting blackjack player Catherine Burns

might happen with with card carrying story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them\nAre I think struck with the

the language they spoke the spoken language was fringe pack claw [noise] ah the letters um [noise] uh I never knew what\nThe court was about because when they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English they then would respond to their latches verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters\nUm this was incredibly uh interesting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me I\nI'm a door to her but mostly what I adored about tours that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so\nLiked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry in speaking English language which I had no interest in learning at all um because in any case it wasn't a proper language\nSo we were told [noise] um [noise]\nEventually uh well as I say I was very I adored this person a eventually when I was around nine years of age I should say I'm a my mother became pregnant and I don't know how this happened [noise] um\nShe I did have a stepfather her husband but still this pregnancy a\nFeel I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm

deeply [noise]\nThe story that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not suitable for children it was told at a mosque night called eye witness stories from the front line here's the vast [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb it's been my twenties or running short stories and drawing away troubles and I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like I'm In\nWar would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few\nThousand dollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war is are able to try to learn to be a war reporter and war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not disappoint by it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body there wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying mores of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war it was a girl was sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by surprise military forces\nAre and ...\nThey took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat and what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot\nAnd the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to ... to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out the front lines that it was\nA go getting pretty bad out there and I tried to get back to freak out and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us but their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was ... and I didn't\nHave any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt at all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen\nMinutes well all these little black holes are staring at us I thought what does it turn it inside those holes and they're so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown\nAnd um\nI kept going back for more I kept going more wars I felt like there was something something I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it\nKept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd ...\nPosted Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty mayhem physician up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and I'm like this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some\nSandbags and some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd when you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at it gives the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives a moment later\nYes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy the bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the

too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared any more Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war\nAnd I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men are free to love each other\nOn reserve is like without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were

the letters\nA word that they send to each other was written in English proper English but the language they spoke the spoken language was French ... ah the letters um [noise] uh I never knew what\nThe corps was about because when they re received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English they then would respond to their latches verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew\nA certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters\nUm this was incredibly uh interesting to me uh everything my mother did was interesting to me I\nI'm adored her but mostly what I adore the vouchers that she adored me [noise]\nUh [noise] so I liked\nTo see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry

life here Sebastian on crafting this story [noise]\nFeel I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm used to sort of talking and explaining how things work\nAnd then I started to understand that that's not what the law says you're really doing is telling a story\nTo understand something more deeply [noise]\nThe story that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not suitable for children and he was told at a mosque night called I Witness stories from the front line here to bash [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI uh first of all the war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb\nI spent my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables and I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man\nThat I felt war would be\nA exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few\nThousand dollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war it's arguable to try to learn to be a war reporter\nAnd war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as\nIt does not at this point\n[noise] um\nFor example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying words as civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil\nWar it was a girl who's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been\nI'm taken by surprise military forces are and ... they took her up to a field above a town called ... and\nThey did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat and what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot and it's the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human\nOr was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines and it was a ... getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few\nA ceremony and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown\nAnd these rebels step by step out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb and I didn't have any grand\nThoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole that the\nBoy comes out of you know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot and another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for\nFifteen minutes well all these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was attorney inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd attorneys in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze\nIn combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd it's\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan a postcard\nRestrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against them sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd when you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you\nSo much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nYou asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives a moment\nLater yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy the boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt\nWhat's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about\nWell I was paralyzed bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed by some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bullet proof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed\nAnd the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap and he grabs Sufi throws my camera to me it feels like bullet proof vest the grass itself is throwing a motor soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down to\nAnd it gets back and I have my camera in my hand\nAnd I start shooting I start working and then a fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve is like\nWithout it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call every step up and we were going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Phillies on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of ... So Tim took the next trip he was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American positions got overrun they dragged off a wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that sim broke his life\nHe's a ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot and says well it's broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by Don and we're going to get\nHammered here's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty man you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it got down on that mountain\nWe finished up our deployment and um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst is in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\nAnd if the the film did really well and started\nIt started with this scene um that was very took me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came um scene where I riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg\nOr riding in a Humvee and all of a sudden everything goes orange and black and the Humvee got blown up he went off under the engine block do instead of under us", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Providence", "day": "28"}
