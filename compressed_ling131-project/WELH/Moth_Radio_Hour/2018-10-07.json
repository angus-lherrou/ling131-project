time on the Ted radio hour from NPR [noise] Sunday afternoon at three in Rhode Island public radio\n[noise]\nThis is the moth radio hour from the Iraq I'm Jennifer ... and our next story as high a special ed teacher we first met any hand ... not far from ...\nHere Danny live at the [noise]\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh by in Cantonese it means busy body curious always asking questions kind of guy negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born kid of immigrants\nYou're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on keep your head down learn English go to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAll the things I learned and everyone around me believe them\nBecause I was born and raised in Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad were six days a week as a construction worker\nAnd when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm doing all of\nThis I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American\n[noise] and\nSo I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S versus China and I asked\nWho are rooting for [noise]\nJoe ... of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask that question though\nBecause when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rockets right\nBut I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen I was excited to watch a PBS documentary becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nSeen three people who ever looked at like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch\nThese last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who look like me they're holding ... signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this\nMan named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who was beaten to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming\nAnd people thought the Japanese were stealing their job they fought\nThe guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people are now saying\nIf this happens to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens\nTo walk into the room as I'm watching this documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat's your family what\nI have all these questions who is he how\nHe related ... like a cousin of a cousin of the ...\nBecause I wasn't born yet in Nineteen eighty two but I'm Wondering like what happened I look\nUp at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how can I ask\nAbout a murdered man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking at articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother ... ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of the choice feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes China set up the filmmakers boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue choice unease at some\nMoments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because of this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rally and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family or someone who spoke up\nTo be a pot again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know so now I'm like I have to find out who\nWill each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer the city where ... lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit\nMy friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to see even sanctions grave we she drives us\nAnd we find ... name on a tune stone lowly chains name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone they're no longer goals\nThey are right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why does means so much to me I go the next states in my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see\nPictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine\nSisters the second sister on this list is Long Beach and so now I Know the legion is my grandmother's sister lowly chin is my mother's first dance and Vincent Chin is my mother's first cousin so I asked my eighth grade\nLee after Vincent Chin died she tells me well when Vince inside lowly was all alone in Detroit\nSo your grandmother and I literally sisters flew to America from China to support her your mom and dad had married in China so your dad came soon after they all found work in New York and that's how your family ended up in Manhattan's\nChinatown I thought about this for a while\nName is Elaine ...

know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause the rockets right but I found my way to figure out this identity issue when I was Thirteen\nI was excited to watch a PBS documentary about becoming American the Chinese experience [noise]\nPeople that I've seen three people who ever looked like me Jackie Chan\nTrainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nAndme on line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch these last\nTwenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding ... signs in English they're chanting in English\nI never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything so big\nThat all these people will go on the street and risk their identity their life they were marching for this man named Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who was beaten to death\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers crisis in Detroit\nWhere Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job they fought the guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and pay three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Filipino people are now saying\nIf this could happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American Asian American I never heard that term before\nAnd Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching this documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch\nAnd she points to screen she looks ... photo and says\nThat's your family what\nI have all these questions who is he how is he related ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met him because\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish in her eyes that she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me the Bush I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask about\nA murder man and our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking up articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and I can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance green the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother ... ... when all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured\nAt her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers of boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's at some\nMoments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because the woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rallying and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before\nAnd I thought to myself I have to find out who will each in is because if lowly chin is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family or someone who spoke up\nTo be bought again to be a busy body curious and be proud of that you know so now I'm like I have to find out who will each\nIn and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place where I think I'll get a full answer\nThe city where Vincent Chin lived inside Detroit and I take an eight hour Meghan bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to see even sanctions grave\nWe she drives us\nAnd we find ... name on a tune stone lowly chains name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone they're no longer goals\nThere right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why does means so much to me\nI go the next day to my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums with my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's line my grandmother had a brother and nine sisters the second\nSister on this list is Long Beach and so now I Know they'll each in if my grandmother sister lowly chin is my mother's first chance and Vincent Chin is my mother first
